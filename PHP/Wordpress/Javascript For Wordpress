                    Javascript For Wordpress
                    Course Notes


1 -
Introduction to the course and the instructor
The course is coming from JS to the Wordpress world
Wordpress is a content management system
  - https://wordpress.com
  - https://wordpress.org
Wordpress has two ways of extending its functionality
  - Themes which extends how it looks
  - Plugins which extend the functionality
  - This was traditionally done in PHP
  - Knowing Javascript and Wordpress is a big plus
Wordpress powers up to 25% of internet sites
  - 30% of Wordpress is JS
  - A lot of the JS in Wordpress was built with the Backbone framework
  - There are several core Wordpress feature written in JS
What JS Framework do we adopt next
  - There are plans to add several JS frameworks due to be added to WP core
  - JS is becoming more integrated and important to WP
  - There are opportunities for people with JS and WP knowledge

The course will cover
  - Intro to JS in Wordpress
  - Enqueuing JS in a theme
  - Enqueuing JS in a plugin
    - This is similar to in a theme but is different enough to need a separate discussion
  - AJAX in Wordpress
    - There is a move to API driven AJAX rather than custom PHP scripts AJAX
  - The Wordpress REST API
    - Using the Wordpress REST API outside of Wordpress
    - Using the Wordpress REST API inside Wordpress
    
The course will used pre-built code samples instead of coding on the fly
  - This wil be non-functioning code and will need to be fixed as part of the exercises
  - The course will deal with the REST API both in and outside of WP

Enqueuing JS
  - Javascript is becoming more important and integrated with Wordpress
  - Enqueuing is the process of loading JS into a theme or the admin area via PHP functions
  - The enqueing Javascript will cover
    - Enqueuing Javascript
    - Enqueuing multiple files and dependencies
    - Making jQuery a dependency
      - There will need to be a no conflict wrapper added to jQuery as there will be a syntax clash with PHP
      - jQuery assumes that the dollar sign belongs to it
      - Wordpress has jQuery added to its core among other JS modules
        - This should be used rather than getting a version in from outside

Example Syntax
  // The main PHP used will be these 2 functions
  // This will load JS dynamically behind the scenes into a theme
  wp_enqueue_script();
  
  // This ws designed so that there could be different languages passed in
  // This has been used as a work around for when there is a need for PHP to be loaded through JS
  // This is done with out using the API
  wp_localize_script();

Example Syntax
  // This an wp_enqueue_script example
  // There are 2 Wordpress hooks which feed everything in here WP_Header & WP_Footer
  wp_enqueue_script(
    'unique-handle-name',
    // Gives a short cut to files
    get_stylesheet_directory_uri().'/path/to/file.js',
    // This can be used when script order matters as Wordpress can not be hardcoded to accept dependencies in order
    ['dependency-handles'],
    // Wordpress will cache CSS & JS files and give them a version number, this can be troublesome in development
    // The course will use timestamps to stop this process
    'version',
    // This is a boolean and is usually set to true
    loadInFooter
  )

Example Syntax
  // wp_localize_script was designed to take different versions of a word eg Spanish, English etc
  wp_localize_script(
    // This is the handle of the file enqued eg theme.js
    'js-handle',
    // This is a global variable name which all the values are attached to
    'name_for_js',
    [
      // Gives a sanitised version of the site name
      'site_url'=>esc_url(home_url()),
      // Gives the name of the site
      'site_name'=>get_bloginfo('name')
    ]
  )

Example Syntax
  // functions.php
  function my_enqueue_scripts(){
    wp_enqueue_script();
    wp_localize_script();
  }
  
  add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts()', 'my_enqueue_scripts()');
