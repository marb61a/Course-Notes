Enqueuing JS
  - Enqueuing is the process of loading JS into a theme or the admin area via PHP functions
Example Syntax
  // The main PHP used will be these 2 functions
  // This will load JS dynamically behind the scenes into a theme
  wp_enqueue_script();
  
  // This ws designed so that there could be different languages passed in
  // This has been used as a work around for when there is a need for PHP to be loaded through JS
  // This is done with out using the API
  wp_localize_script();

Example Syntax
  // This an wp_enqueue_script example
  wp_enqueue_script(
    'unique-handle-name',
