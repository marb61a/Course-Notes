Introduction to the course & the instructor
The prerequiaites of the course are 
  - PHP 5..6 and above

2 - Imperative And Declarative Programming
A look at what the section will cover
Imperative programming
  - It is a programming paradigm around executing statements that change the program state
A programming paradigm defines a style of building and structuring an application
Most languages support mulitple paradigms
Statements are units of action evaluated in sequence
