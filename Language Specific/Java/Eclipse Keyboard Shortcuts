                    Eclipse Keyboard Shortcuts
                    From multiple sites 


CTRL + D - Delete row. Try it! 

ALT + Up/Down Arrow - Move the row (or the entire selection) up or down. 

ALT + Left/Right Arrow - Move to the last location you edited. 

CTRL+SHIFT+O - Organize imports.

CTRL+1 - Probably the most useful one. It activates the quick fix. 

CTRL+SHIFT+T - Open Type. Imagine, that you need to have a look at the "Foo" class. But, where is the "Foo" class? Is it in the "Boo" project and in the "foo.bar" package? Or somewhere else? With this shortcut, you don't need to know. Just press it, type "Foo," and you are in.

CTRL+E - Shows you a list of all open editors.

CTRL+F6

Use to move between open editors. This is a slower alternative to Ctrl + E. It comes in handy in a situation when you want to periodically switch between two editors, something that is nearly impossible with Ctrl+E as it sorts entries quite randomly. Or you might just use Alt+Arrows.

CTRL+F7

Move between views. When in the editor, press Ctrl+F7 to switch to the Package Explorer, or hold Ctrl and press F7 multiple times to switch to other views.

CTRL+F8

Move between perspectives. The same as Ctrl+F7.

CTRL + F11 - Runs the application. 

CTL + N - Open a new type wizard.

CTRL + M - Maximize or umaximize your current tab.

CTRL + I - Corrects indentation.

CTRL + SHIFT + F - Formats code it is found at settings under Window->Preferences->Java->Code style->Formatter

CTRL + J

Incremental search. Similar to the search in Firefox, it shows you results as you type. Don't be surprised if, when you hit this combination, nothing happens, at first glance at least. Just start typing and Eclipse will move your cursor to the first occurrence.

CTRL + SHIFT + L

Shows you a list of your currently defined shortcut keys.

I Don't Like Your Shortcuts
Such is life nowadays. Remember, you can always change those bindings to match your preferences. Open Windows->Preferences->General->Keys. Now you can use the filter to find your shortcut and change its binding. 

The real fun begins when you cannot find the command you are looking for. The key here is to have the "Include unbounds commands" checkbox checked. It will show you all the commands, even those which have no keys bound.

While you are here, I recommend adding the following bindings:

CTRL+SHIFT+G

Bind this to "Generate getters and setters." This is a "must have."

ALT+C

Bind this to SVN/CVS "Commit."

ALT+U

Bind this to SVN/CVS "Update."

Now, type "new" (without quotes) in the filter text. You should see a list of all the new type wizards. Choose the most frequently used ones and assign them a shortcut. For example, the most used wizard for me is the new class wizard. Thus I assigned it the CTRL+SHIFT+N key combination.

Let me demonstrate a quick way to create a new class now.

Hit CTRL + SHIFT + N (or the combination you assigned in the previous step). This should bring up the new class wizard. Type in the name and press ALT+E. You can now select a class which will be a superclass for the newly created class. Hit ALT+A and select all implemented interfaces. Now hit ALT+F and your class will be generated. Eclipse will also provide the default implementation for all abstract and interface methods you inherited.

Did you notice the weird underscores everywhere in the dialog? They give you a hint about the shortcut key. Hit ALT and the underlined letter to press the button, check the checkbox or focus on a text field.

Did you notice the underscores?

I think that using shortcut keys is the fastest way to productivity and, if not, then at least your wrists will give you a silent "thanks." Now, don't wait, go on and assign keys to the features you use most.

One final tip from Andriy:

The problem is that there are so many keyboard shortcuts. I used to keep a printout with all the shortcuts I wanted to use. Finally, I wrote an Eclipse plugin, MouseFeed, which reminds me of the keyboard shortcuts for the actions called with the mouse. You can even tell it to enforce some shortcuts â€” the action will run only if called with a keyboard shortcut.
