1 - Pricing Lamps and Wallets
This was originally a problem for student interns at Shopify to solve
In the challenge the students are given
  - A json feed of products
  - The challenge is to figure how much every variant of every lamp and wallet that is available would cost
  - Each product had multiple fields

Example Syntax
  // index.php
  <?php
    require_once '../vendor/autoload.php';
    
    function load_json($path){
      return json_decode(file_get_contents(__DIR__."/".$path), true);
    }
    
    // products.json is the json file saved with the Shopify goods 
    // This and the helper function are to avoid having to use the real API 
    $products = load_json('products.json')['products'];
    
    // dd stands for dump and die and is available in lots of PHP frameworks
    // it will dump the products into an array which can be seen on screen
    dd($products);
    
    // There are a few different approaches to solving the problem
    // The first is a procedural approach
    
    
  ?>
