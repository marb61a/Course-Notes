                    Hands-On Reactive Programming with Python
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - INTRODUCTION AND SETUP
1 - The Course Overview
A quick overview of the course and introduction to the instructor
The pre-requisites for students are
  - Understanding Python programming
  - Have some familiarity with the reactive programming model
  - Understand Client/Server architecture
  - Data Structures
  - HTML\JS

2 - Exploring Reactive Programming and Its Advantages
Reactive and Reactive programming means taking a dynamic approach to a change in streams
  - This includes UI interfaces and real-time animations
  - In reactive data streams will be the spine of the application
  - These data streams can convey Events, Failures, Messages and Calls
  - They observe streams and then react when a value is emitted
  - They can be created from multiple sources including
    - Click events
    - HTTP requests
    - Notifications etc

There are advantages to using the Reactive paradigm
  - Improved user experience
  - They are easy to manage
  - There is simpler threading

RxExtensions
  - This is an API for async programming
  - There are versions for multiple languages, the Python version is at
    - https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY
  -
