                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - INSTALLATION AND SETUP
1 - The Course Overview
Introduction to both the instructor and the course
  - A quick run though of course curriculum

2 - Installing RxPy Reactive Extensions

3 - Installing Qt5 and PyQt5

4 - Installing the Tornado Web Framework



                    Section 2 - REACTIVE EXTENSIONS FOR PYTHON
1 - What Is Reactive Programming?
The core concept of Reactive Programming are Observables
  - Observables are streams that emit items
  - Observable can be mapped, filtered and have other operators applied to them
  - They are lazily evaluated, this is important to note
  - The RxMarbles diagram can help understanding Observables
    - http://rxmarbles.com
Example Syntax
  // Observables example
  def print_value(value):
    print('{} is the value'.format(value))
    
  Observable.from_(['abc', 'def', 'ghi'])\
    .subscribe(print_value)
    
  Observable.interval(1)\
    // This is 30 milliseconds
    .take_until(Observable.timer(30))\
    .sample(3)\
    .subscribe(print_value)

2 - Reactive Operators and Observables – From, Interval, and Buffer

3 - More Reactive Operators and Observables – Group By, Sample, and Max

4 - Loading CSV Data Reactively with RxPy

5 - Even More Reactive Operators – Map, FlatMap, Window, CombineLatest, and Zip
