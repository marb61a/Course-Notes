                    JavaScript: The New Hard Parts
                    Course Notes 


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
The course is expected to be very demanding
  - Students will need to be explain their code clearly
Brief introduction to the instructor
Being a great engineer means the ability to build quality products
The material is asked by a lot of interviewers
Students background is agnostic so CS degree is not necessary
Candidates should meets 5 criteria
  - Analytical problem solving with code
  - Technical Communication
  - Engineering best practices and approach
  - Non-technical communication
  - Language and computer science experience
The 5th and final criteria is often the least important
  - It's important not to just know the latest framework
  - Understanding of language specific syntax will evolve

2 - JavaScript Code Execution



                    Section 2 - Asynchronous JavaScript
1 - Introducing Asynchronicity
Asynchronicity is the backbone of modern web development in JavaScript
JavaScript is single threaded
  - This means that one command at a time executes
  - It also has a synchronous execution model which means that each line is executed in the order it appears
