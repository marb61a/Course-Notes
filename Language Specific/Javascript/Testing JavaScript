                    Testing JavaScript
                    Course Notes


1 - Throw an Error with a Simple Test in JavaScript
Example Syntax
  // There is a bug in the sum function
  const sum = (a, b) => a - b
  
  const subtract = (a, b) => a - b
  
  // An automated test to ensure that the bug in sum never gets through
  // This is code that throws an error when there are unexpected occurences
  const result = (3, 7);
  const expected = 10;
  
  if(result !== expected) {
    throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`)
  }
