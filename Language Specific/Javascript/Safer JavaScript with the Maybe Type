                    Safer JavaScript with the Maybe Type
                    Course Notes


1 - Course Introduction Safer JavaScript with the Maybe type
Brief introduction to the course
The course will use the Crocks library for demonstrating concepts
  - https://github.com/evilsoft/crocks
  - There are other similar other libraries available

2 - Understand the Maybe Data Type
Example Syntax 
  // A sample utility file utils.js where there are a few simple utility functions being exported
  // Beginning code
  const inc = n => n + 1;
  
  const dbl = n => n * 2;
  
  const toUpper = s => s.toUpperCase();
  
  module.exports = {
    dbl,
    inc,
    toUpper
  }
  
  // index.js will pull in utils.js
  const { inc } = require('../utils.js');
  
  const input = 2;
  
  const result = inc(input);
  
  console.log(result);      // Should be 3

3 - Create a Maybe with a `safe` Utility Function

4 - Unwrap Values from a Maybe

5 - Safely Access Object Properties with `prop`

6 - Safely Access Nested Object Properties with `propPath`

7 - Flatten Nested Maybes with `chain`

8 - Recover from a Nothing with the `alt` method

9 - Recover from a Nothing with the `coalesce` Method

10 - Compose Functions for Reusability with the Maybe Type

11 - Apply a function in a Maybe context to Maybe inputs

12 - Make your own functions safer by lifting them into a Maybe context
