                    Course Notes


1. Introduction - What You Will Learn - About the Course Files (Watch this First!)
A quick intro to the instructor
The course is meant as a companion to an Observable course by the same author
All of the RxJS operators will be covered
  - The course has enough material to become an RxJS expert
  - The course will improve JS coding levels
    - There are some useful NodeJS techniques used which will be good to pick up
  - The course is heavily practical orientated
    - Students should code along where possible
  - The use cases are mostly non trivial examples
  - Students will learn how to implement common data structures eg Redux
  - If you get stuck use the GitHub repo
    - https://github.com/danielstern/rxjs-operators
  - Certain version numbers of Node are important so again any problems use the repo
