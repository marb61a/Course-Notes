Introduction to the course
TypeScript is a typed superset of Javascript

  - It was developed by Microsoft
  - It compiles to JS for either the browser or Node
    - It overlaps with some JS technologies like Babel
  - There are 3 parts Language, Language Service and Compiler
  - It seems to be leading the way for JS language features
    - Features that were TypeScript are now in JS
