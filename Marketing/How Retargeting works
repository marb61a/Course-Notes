Remarketing and Retargeting are the same thing

Typical conversion rate is about 1 - 3%
Remarketing is a crucial way to increase conversion rates
Display Network advertising rate is 0.07%
Remarketing Click Through Rate(CTR) is 0.7% - 1.0%
Remarketing Process -
  Visitor comes to your site
  Visitor leaves site(98% of the time)
  Visitor sees your ads as they surf the web
  Remarketing brings your visitors back at the right time
Different types of remarketing - Email, Social Media, Search Ads using keywords

RLSA - Remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA) is a feature that lets you customize your search ads campaign for people 
who have previously visited your site, and tailor your bids and ads to these visitors when they're searching on Google

OBA - Online Behavioural Advertising, this is a broad set of activities companies engage in to collect information about 
your online activity (like webpages you visit) and use it to show you ads or content they believe to be more relevant to you.

Retargeting is a much more indepth than behavioural or intent based marketing and gives a very detailed picture of user
engagement.
