                    MODULE 3 - SOCIAL SIGNALS
Introductory video 
A Social Signal is when you use a Social Account to affect your search rankings
 - A Facebook like
 - A +1 on Google Plus
 - Somebody tweeting your website url
Certain niches have different importance levels on the social platforms
EG Pinterest is better for
 - Arts & Crafts Niches
 - Women Related Niches
SMM - Social Media Marketing -- different than the social signals being sought
          
3.1 - Addmefast.com
Again we're talking about two different things when we talk about generating social signals for 
SEO versus legitimate social media marketing.
Addmefast - http://addmefast.com
There are dozens of legitimate ways, to generate social signals for your accounts
First thing I would actually like you to do is, the business owner, have them get legitimate social shares. 
 - Employees
 - Family Members
The above should do sharing on the Social Media channels
These are going to be geo-located social signals so they're going to be desirable

1 - Get real social signals through legitimate means.
2 - Use a social media sharing site called Addmefast.com
3 - Add your client's sites to this network
4 - Earn points for free by liking and following and sharing and tweet other people in this network or buy points
5 - Multiple different signals are allowed by the site
6 - Website hits is one option that you Do Not want to use
7 - Add a title, and this is going to be just for you to remember, it has nothing to do with your campaign, so this will just be 
    probably the name of the website
8 - Add a URL for the accounts you are using
9 - Do not buy clicks on Fiverr
10 - Use a much more natural drip-feed quantity of these social shares
11 - No magic formula
12 - Cost per click is in points


3.2 - Social ADR
The training says not to send SocialADR links to money sites
Another service that is similar to Addmefastbut not exactly the same, these are two good services that you can use in unison. 
You can go in create social accounts and use them to bookmark and share other people's stuff, in which case it's free.
You can alternatively purchase credits.
You can use a paypal account to purchase credits
To add a bookmark, type in the address in the URL, which is the URL that we're promoting.
Very important in keywords that you use Spintax.
Many different spintax tool providers
Different submission rates will have different costs more often is more expensive
Again slow and steady is the best way forward to avoid issues
