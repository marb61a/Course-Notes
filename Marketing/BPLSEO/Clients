4.1 - Picking Clients
Your ideal client is going to vary somewhat based upon where you are, in your SEO business
In the beginning, when you are growing your business and growing your brand, you may want to go after people who are on the lower 
end of the pay scale
You may want to do some work for free for testimonies or proof
A good client 
  - Already understands the value of online marketing 
  - Is already paying for it. 
This is especially true if you are talking about an older demographic
The younger demographic, more than likely, they are going to understand how important online marketing is
Anyone who is paying for marketing and advertising at all, is someone that we want
A few things, that you are going to look for
 - Someone that has already got a website, and they are not ranking for anything
 - People who haven't claimed their Google My Business or Bing Business or their Yelp page.
 - Look for is someone who is already spending money on Google Ad Words or on YellowPages.com
 - People who have established businesses are good. You don't really want to work with start-ups
 - Look for businesses who have some signs of success
 - Look for people and businesses that have budgets, are high-volume, have high margins or have a high cost per product
If someone is not willing to go to your discovery form and fill it out, then they are not going to be your client
You need to start training your client to work within your process.
Make sure, again, that you put a lot of time and energy into doing pre-qualification
 
 
4.2 - Discovery Form
A discovery form is simply a pre-qualifying document that allows you to collect information about potential clients in order to do 
more research and to be able to give them a quote. 
Kotton Grammer - Discovery form available on his site
http://www.gravityforms.com - WP plugin (Paid)
There may be conflicts with other forms
Part of your client process is going to be sending them to the form on your website

 
4.3 - Intake Form
The purpose of this is going to be you have already closed the client, you've already signed the contract, and the next step is for
them to get you all the information that you need in order to launch their campaign.
Always tell clients that incomplete submissions will not be accepted.

 
4.4 - Intro to Prospecting
Quick intro to Prospecting
Author has used the methods personally

 
4.5 - Prospecting 1 - MLM
The first client is very important, for a variety of reasons
 - Because it gives you a little bit of confidence in yourself that you can get a client
 - You can rank a site. 
 - Good to use for proof, for getting future clients.
Downline - the people who would sign up underneath you
Sit down and brainstorm - Very important and not too basic
Method 1 - Write a list of family covering
 - Name
 - Contact Details 
 - Occupation
Do the same list for friends
This list can be done using pen & paper or Excel or whatever is needed
If the list is big enough you are likely to find at least 1 person with a business that could be promoted
Don't think automatically that someone is not a potential client at this point
A couple of ways that you can make them aware
 - You need to announce it, and make sure everyone knows it eg Facebook post, Twitter etc
 - Define it in a very easy to understand way, and then do a specific Call to Action eg Call me at this number
You should give the above a full week or so to work
Afete a week devise a plan to get in contact with the people that you made, in your list using eg Email with similar post to Facebook
