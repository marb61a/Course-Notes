4.1 - Picking Clients
Your ideal client is going to vary somewhat based upon where you are, in your SEO business
In the beginning, when you are growing your business and growing your brand, you may want to go after people who are on the lower 
end of the pay scale
You may want to do some work for free for testimonies or proof
A good client 
  - Already understands the value of online marketing 
  - Is already paying for it. 
This is especially true if you are talking about an older demographic
The younger demographic, more than likely, they are going to understand how important online marketing is
Anyone who is paying for marketing and advertising at all, is someone that we want
A few things, that you are going to look for
 - Someone that has already got a website, and they are not ranking for anything
 - People who haven't claimed their Google My Business or Bing Business or their Yelp page.
 - Look for is someone who is already spending money on Google Ad Words or on YellowPages.com
 - People who have established businesses are good. You don't really want to work with start-ups
 - Look for businesses who have some signs of success
 - Look for people and businesses that have budgets, are high-volume, have high margins or have a high cost per product
If someone is not willing to go to your discovery form and fill it out, then they are not going to be your client
You need to start training your client to work within your process.
Make sure, again, that you put a lot of time and energy into doing pre-qualification
 
 
4.2 - Discovery Form
A discovery form is simply a pre-qualifying document that allows you to collect information about potential clients in order to do 
more research and to be able to give them a quote. 
Kotton Grammer - Discovery form available on his site
http://www.gravityforms.com - WP plugin (Paid)
There may be conflicts with other forms
Part of your client process is going to be sending them to the form on your website

 
4.3 - Intake Form
The purpose of this is going to be you have already closed the client, you've already signed the contract, and the next step is for
them to get you all the information that you need in order to launch their campaign.
Always tell clients that incomplete submissions will not be accepted.
