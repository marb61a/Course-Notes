                     MODULE 4 - CLIENTS
Introductory video for the section               
                  
4.1 - Picking Clients
Your ideal client is going to vary somewhat based upon where you are, in your SEO business
In the beginning, when you are growing your business and growing your brand, you may want to go after people who are on the lower 
end of the pay scale
You may want to do some work for free for testimonies or proof
A good client 
  - Already understands the value of online marketing 
  - Is already paying for it. 
This is especially true if you are talking about an older demographic
The younger demographic, more than likely, they are going to understand how important online marketing is
Anyone who is paying for marketing and advertising at all, is someone that we want
A few things, that you are going to look for
 - Someone that has already got a website, and they are not ranking for anything
 - People who haven't claimed their Google My Business or Bing Business or their Yelp page.
 - Look for is someone who is already spending money on Google Ad Words or on YellowPages.com
 - People who have established businesses are good. You don't really want to work with start-ups
 - Look for businesses who have some signs of success
 - Look for people and businesses that have budgets, are high-volume, have high margins or have a high cost per product
If someone is not willing to go to your discovery form and fill it out, then they are not going to be your client
You need to start training your client to work within your process.
Make sure, again, that you put a lot of time and energy into doing pre-qualification
 
 
4.2 - Discovery Form
A discovery form is simply a pre-qualifying document that allows you to collect information about potential clients in order to do 
more research and to be able to give them a quote. 
Kotton Grammer - Discovery form available on his site
http://www.gravityforms.com - WP plugin (Paid)
There may be conflicts with other forms
Part of your client process is going to be sending them to the form on your website

 
4.3 - Intake Form
The purpose of this is going to be you have already closed the client, you've already signed the contract, and the next step is for
them to get you all the information that you need in order to launch their campaign.
Always tell clients that incomplete submissions will not be accepted.

 
4.4 - Intro to Prospecting
Quick intro to Prospecting
Author has used the methods personally

 
4.5 - Prospecting 1 - MLM
The first client is very important, for a variety of reasons
 - Because it gives you a little bit of confidence in yourself that you can get a client
 - You can rank a site. 
 - Good to use for proof, for getting future clients.
Downline - the people who would sign up underneath you
Sit down and brainstorm - Very important and not too basic
Method 1 - Write a list of family covering
 - Name
 - Contact Details 
 - Occupation
Do the same list for friends
This list can be done using pen & paper or Excel or whatever is needed
If the list is big enough you are likely to find at least 1 person with a business that could be promoted
Don't think automatically that someone is not a potential client at this point
A couple of ways that you can make them aware
 - You need to announce it, and make sure everyone knows it eg Facebook post, Twitter etc
 - Define it in a very easy to understand way, and then do a specific Call to Action eg Call me at this number
You should give the above a full week or so to work
Afete a week devise a plan to get in contact with the people that you made, in your list using eg Email with similar post to Facebook

 
4.6 - Prospecting 2 - Scratch My Back
This is Client Prospecting Method Number Two
You should have tried out the first method completely before trying out this method
In this section we will make a list but this time the list will be a list of all of the businesses, consultants, basically everyone
that you are a customer of.
Again brainstorming is going to be needed so somewhere quiet will be needed 
The major rationale behind this strategy is based on 2 two things
 -You already have a relationship with them so it will be much more of a warm sell
 - If you are a client of theirs, then they are fairly likely to let you pitch them
That doesn’t mean you’re going to close them but you absolutely should have a chance to pitch them.
Course author recommends dentists as bing fantastic clients to have
Other businesses recommended to contact are
 - Hairdressers
 - Mortgage Brokers
 - Estate Agents
 - Businesses that are single owner businesses or sole proprietorships
Again make use of family and friends on this as they will be cusomers of lots of businesses too
This is a really good way to get some clients and get things started.

 
4.7 - Prospecting 3 - Get Out There
Client prospecting method number 3
This is where you have got to gosomeone's place of business, and do a pitch. 
If you want people give you business on a recurring basis for SEO work as clients, you will need to meet with them at least once
First port of call is the Chamber of Commerce for the area, there maybe more than one in reach
Recommended that you join as they help get clients and authority links
If you join then be active as being active will more likely get you business
A lot of these chambers don't have any real SEOs
Use meetup sites - www.meetup.com and then a city
If there is none go ahead and you could start a meet up group
You will propbably need to buy products and services from people in the group yourself
Never get a repuation as the guy that pitches and never buys
If there's something that's being sold  that you would buy anyway, even if it costs a little bit more, buy it in your group
Business networking is another site
 - http://www.bni.ie
 - http://www.dublinbusinessnetwork.com
These are professionally organized networking groups, they usually have a fee
The main reason why this is good is because they only allow one business type per BNI chapter. 
This means that if you do internet marketing/search engine marketing, whatever, you are it. There's not going to be anyone else in 
the group that they allow to sell that service.
With most BNI chapters you are required to be there a certain number of times, per month usually

 
4.8 - Follow The Money
Make sure that you have been doing the methods in the previous sections
One of the biggest hurdles to overcome initially when you are trying to sell SEO to clients is getting the buy-in
One of the most difficult things to do is to convince a business that there's going to a good ROI for investing in online marketing
If you have someone who's in their 20s, 30s, who controls the business finances, you're much more likely to close the deal on online
marketing than if the person who contros the finances is older, 50 plus. 
The ideal perfect prospect is someone who is already spending money on online marketing
https://www.spyfu.com - It allows you to see information on competitors
https://www.ispionage.com - Similar to spy-fu
The ROI on an SEO, organic SEO, is just so much higher, but when you get to a certain point where you've maxed out organic, then you 
definitely want to start doing PPC
Use search engines to search for local businesses that are already paying for adverts

 
4.9 - Page 2
This is using companies that end up on page 2 of the SERP's
Companies on Page 2 may previously have been on Page 1
Don't think that just because someone's on the second page that they've never seen the first page
This is especially true if you're looking at positions eleven through thirteen. Those, typically will flip flop with positions eight
through ten on page one if it's a ten result SERP
Traffic can be very low for page 2 sites
Multiple reasons for an organisation to be on Page 2 rather than Page 1
Depending on the niche don't ignore page three

 
4.10 - Pricing Intro
A quick introduction as there are a series of pricing videos

 
4.11 - Pricing Clients 1
It's important to have a logical method for determining what prices to charge for the services that we offer
Most clients are new to internet marketing and online marketing, and they don't really understand what you do and how you do it
It's very important you are able to make them clearly understand the value that you are bringing to their organisation
SEO is another business overhead, it's important to have some logic behind our pricing. 
One thing that you can do to asses your local market is just to go out and see what other SEOs are charging
Also visit some websites of some local SEO companies, or web design companies that offer internet marketing; some of them will have 
packages and prices right there on the website
One method of determining prices are going to be based on the cost-per-click value of the traffic in AdWords
The average person who is number one organically for Google is going to get roughly between 45-50% of the clicks on that page
You will always need to show an ROI to any potential customer eg a customer can pay you 40% of what AdWords PPC will cost
This method can be used in finding people who are getting Ads, who are paying for Ads, and converting them into organic.
The SEO methods should provide higher conversion rates and higher traffic volumes

 
4.12 - Pricing Clients 2
This example is going to use an industry standard formula
It's a very good rule of thumb to use to estimate, especially if there have lots of recurring.
The formula is average value of a sale times the number of repeated transactions times the average retention time in months or years
If this is an established business they are going to know this data
If they're not an established business then this is going to be more challenging and you will need a new method
A 1% conversion rate is actually fairly standard for more of an e-commerce type site.
But when you're looking at things like this, personal sites, it's actually much, much higher.

 
4.13 - Pricing Table
A one-off for those of you who are not familiar with the term is just simply an a la carte purchase
It's when someone purchases something from you one time instead of multiple times.
Ideally you want most of the time to be going for recurring revenue from our clients
