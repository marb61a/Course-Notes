An example company - Poppin Furniture is chosen to illustrate why the account hierarchy is setup as it is
Location Targeting is configured at the campaign level

apropriate for that time period is aired.


6 - Naming Your Campaign and Selecting The Right Campaign Type

Try to have a proper name convention for your campaigns
There are multiple types of campaign available, choose search networking rather than other options

There are different types of search campaigns, all features is chosen here
Call only ads work very well for businesses that only want phone calls, they only show up on smartphones
call only ads work when there is a click on the ad a call is made to the number


7 - Understanding the Different Types of Google AdWords Device Targeting
Discusses Networks setting including Google search nework partners including sites like Amazon
Search partners include - Youtube, CNN, Maps, there is no official list
Can be accessed using google toolbar in other browsers
You wont know where in the partner network your ads appear
Branded search terms have better conversion rates
There is no right or wrong answer
If on a limited budget exclude search partner network
Add search partner network if expanding budget before adding display campaigns 


8 - Taking a Deeper Look at Some Interesting Tablet Trends
Google has recently allowed ads specifically targeted at tablets
Steep decline in conversion rates from computers > phones > tablets
Mobile Phones have the lowest cost per click
Don't bid on tablets to begin with especially on a limited budget
Bad user experience is the No1 factor for suffering conversion rates
Conversion rates should get better with better responsive sites
Spending on traffic acquisition outpaces traffic optimisation 


9 - Understanding Location Targeting at the Campaign Level in AdWords
Applies to every advertiser!!
This is an absolute must for Local Businesses!!!
If available historical data can be used to guide decisions
One trend - Major cities are more expensive but have higher volume
Use Google Keyword Planner to see competitors bidding
What market do you want to be in?
Geo Targeting can be modified later on
Use geo targeting to exclude competitor locations
If a competitor clicks on your link its not fraudulent clicks and you still have to pay
Compliance with regulations
Features of location targeting
  - Basic Inclusions\Exclusions
  - Advanced search city etc
  - Radius Targeting 1 - 500 miles
  - Location Groups eg demographic tiers
  - Bulk locations

10 -Configuring Location Targeting and Using the Advanced Search Functions
By default set to US and Canada
Reach in this context means potential reach for an ad
Menu allows for include or exclude of locationd
There is an advanced search option
You may want to add a set of smaller locations instead of the single larger location
When finished all you have to do is click done
You cannot exclude by radius only add


11 - Using Advanced Location Targeting Setting to Further Customize Your Ad Delivery
There are some more advanced location targeting settings which enhance targeting
Reach People in, Seacrching For, or who show interest in my targeted location
  - Person doesn't have to be in target location to see ad
  - Show interest vague and up to google
  - Default option but not recommended
Reach People in target location(recommended)
 - Only shown to people to be considered to be physically in target location
 - More control over ad view
Reach Seacrching For, or who show interest in my targeted location
 - Can be very vague
 - Where the user is physically is ignored
 - Not recommended
Exclude People in, Seacrching For, or viewing pages about excluded locations
 - Recommended and default option
Exclude People in excluded locations


12 - Setting Your Language Targeting Settings and Introduction to Bidding Strategies
Straightforward to set
By default uses main language of the target country
What language the ads are written in is the language its displayed in

Several different bidding strategies
Manual is the most similar to traditional auctions
Manual is recommended for beginner


13 - Automated Bidding Strategies! (Target CPA, Target ROAS and Target Page Location)
A wide spectrum of bidding strategies
Target Search Page Location
 - Objective is to increase brand awareness by having Ad impressions higher up SERP
 - Increased CTR is also an objective
 - Google takes control of keyword level bids to try win as many first page or top of page bids that your budget allows
 - Scenario to be used is where you want to be seen and recognized within a certain region
Target CPA(Cost Per Aquisition)
 - Objective is to get as many conversions as possible for target CPA
 - Click cost does not matter
 - As long as clicks are being got at a profitable cost business will grow
 - Google predicts which clicks convert and how much those conversions are worth
 - Conversion value is not essential for CPA target
 - You must have conversion tracking set up
 - Should have at least 2-3 conversions per day per campaign
Target ROAS(Return On Ad Spend)
 - Objective is to bid based on return on your advertising spending
 - ROAS = Total Conversion Value / Cost
 - Google predicts which clicks convert and how much those conversions are worth
 - You tell Google what conversions are worth
 - You must have conversion values configured
 - Must have at least 15 conversions in the last 30 days
 - Conversion values must be consistent within a range for a few days
 

14 - Automated Bidding Part 2! Target outranking share, maximize clicks & ECPC
Target Outranking Share
 - Objective is to beat your competition
 - Ignores CPA and ROAS
 - Outranking is when your ad is shown above another ad
 - You tell Google which domain you would like to outrank
 - You control a max CPC bid limit
 - Can take up to a week to see results
 - If a competitor is trying to do similar things can get expensive and messsy
 - Applies to all keywords
 - Not used too often
Maximise Clicks
 - Most Automated
 - Google defaults to this
 - Objective is to get as many people as possible to your site
 - Google tries to get as many clicks as possible by choosing right bids across all your keywords
 - Maximum CPC bid limit
 - Applying portfolio bid strategies allows you to apply this to just a set of keywords in a campaign with a different strategy
 - Gives Google most control
Manual CPC with Enhanced CPC(ECPC)
 - Objective is maintain tight control over individual keyword bids
 - Needs some trust in Google algorithm to optimise CPC for more conversions
 - Google automatically increases your bids by 30% or decreases by 100% based on how likely a click will lead to a conversion
 - ECPC does sometimes work to maintain or increase conversion volume
 - You can set max CPC level at Keyword, Ad Group or Campaign levels
 - ECPC starts off by modifying 50% of traffic and adjusts based on performance
 - Good place to start experimenting with automation
 

15 - Manual CPC Bidding and Configuring Profitable Bids Inside The AdWords Dashboard
Simple enough to use
 - Objective is maintain control over bids in every auction
 - You are willing to pay what you are willing to pay 
 - Default bid at the campaign and ad group level
 - Can also set individual key word bids
 - Google wont bid anymore than your max
 - You can add ECPC at any time
 - Best option starting out
 - Does not need conversion tracking to work
 - For a new account there is no way of working out a default bid, tools like spyfu will help
You always set daily budget
There is no guarantee that your budget will be spent
There is no daily rollover
Overages - Overspending on keywords click normally 10% - 15%


16 - Understanding Standard vs Advanced Ad Delivery Options (in-depth look)
2 different options for delivery method
Standard 
 - Optimise delivery of ads
 - Spread out evenly over time
 - Google recommended
 - Easier to determine best hour of day schedules
 - Ensures Visibility through the day
 - Harder to see potential of keywords
Accelerated
 - Does not optimise delivery
 - Spends budget more quickly
 - Author recommended
 - Maybe the best way to get volume
 - Truer data
 - Helps figuring out appropriate budget
 - There potentially inaccurate click cost data
 - Potentially misleading competitive analysis
 - Maybe missing out on ideal opportunities later in the day
Required daily budget for all potential click is CTR x CPC
You are not going to get impressions for every keywords

** If your budget is fixed start with standard, if flexible start with accelerated

Start date in the future is fairly uncommon
Hard Scheduling

Soft Scheduling
