2 - Welcome to this course! Let's lay the groundwork for good landing page design
Preview of the course
CRO - Conversion Rate Optimisation
Spending on traffic acquisition was bigger than traffic optimisation by 92%
All landing pages have issues which affect potential customers
Clarity - is the most important element in landing page design
5 second usability test - The most famous of usability tests, cheap and easy to run, the test is run by showing
an image of your landing page with branding removed to people for 5 seconds. They are then asked some questions 
often including
  Who is the company
  What do they sell
  What value do they add to you etc
  

3 - The Myth Of The Perfect Landing Page Conversion Rate
There is no such thing as a perfect conversion rate
Not all site visitors are sales prospects
There is no such thing as an average conversion rate either
Conversion ceiling is well below 100%
3 types of visitors
  No's - Will never convert due to factors like affordability etc
  Yes's - Will always convert due to high level of commitment
  Maybe's - This section of visitors has the highest potential influence


4 - The 3 Main Types of Landing Pages and How To Use Them Effectively
The goal of the marketing campaign will determine what is the correct type of landing page.
Primary Site
  - Contains everything about your business
  - Provides most information
Microsite
  - A modified version of main site
  - Strong emphasis on one type of conversion action
  - Some are used as to uplift businesses
Dedicated Landing Page
  - No navigation
  - Few links
  - Always contains a call to action
  - Has a sense of immediacy
  - Most popular among PPC\SEO campaigns targeting high commercial keywords 
Attention Ratio 
  - Have as few distractions as possible away from primary conversion action
  - ideal ratio is 1 - 1 and dedicated landing page offers that opportunity
  - The closer to 1-1 ratio then the higher conversion rates will be


5 - Common Business Models and Understanding Your Conversion Actions
A conversion is defined as an action that is measurable and has a value
Ecommerce 
          - Most popular conversion is a sale
          - Requires high commitment
          - Average 1-3% average for ecommerce sites
Lead Gen 
          - Usually a service
          - More higher end good
          - Less commitment than ecommerce
          - Longer sales cycle
Publishers\Blogs
          - Make money from ad revenue
          - Give away content
          - Increased prevalence of premium offers
          - Conversion actions include newsletter signup, time on site, click on ads

Desired Conversion Actions 
  - Sales, Subscriptons, Form Fill Rate, Downloads, Advert Revenue

Ad Revenue has decreased over the last few years

Most websites value multiple actions
Every page should have only one primary conversion action
Good design has one conversion in mind


6 - The AIDA Sales Funnel and The Online Decision Making Process
First introduced 1898 Elias StElmo Lewis
The AIDA sales funnel is the foundation of most modern sales teams
All buyers go through 4 cognitive phases
Awareness - Become aware of a need and the existence of a product or service which can meet that need
Interest - Interested in learning about the product or service 
Desire - An active sense of desire for that particular product or service
Action - Where the buyer takes the action

Prospect need different information and treatment in different parts of the funnel
Length of cycle(time take to go through the funnel) can vary greatly
The AIDA funnel is more complex today but still essential

AIDA for websites designed by Andrew Chaa 2002
Browsers = Awareness
Evaluators = Interest
Transactors = Desire
Customers = Action


7 - The Awareness Stage of the Funnel: Where It All Begins
Awareness is a commodity in short supply
Its is vitally important to capture awareness from visitors
People at this stage of the buyer cycle have low levels of commitment to your business and need reassurance and clarity
Permission Marketing - Trades free value in exchange for awareness and engagement
If you are unable to communicate clearly what you offer and how it benefits the customer there will be no interest
Your landing page 
  - Should evoke a sense of calmness
  - Not every element deserves emphasis
  - No gaudy or flashy visuals or colour schemes that are too bold
  - Make things easy to find
Your visitors are not kids in a sweet shop 
  - Too many things to click on create unnecessary distractions
  - Any emphasis on secondary conversion actions detracts from primary conversion actions
  - Supporting copy needs to be relatable and relvant
  - Visual promenence must be given to you primary conversion goal
Too much talking
  - Do not write jargon or hyperbolae, generating awareness is about capturing attention quickly
  - Unclutter your page elements
  - Clear headlines and sub headlines
  - Clearly defined action block


8 - The Interest Stage of the Funnel: Tell Me More
Higher level of commitment than awareness but not that much
Can be accomplished with a fleeting level of attention to one particular element on landing pages
Interest is always self selected
Person based selection
  - Gives visitors a chance to self identify based on their characteristics
  - Gives users clarity and context and helps them make a decision where to click to explore more
Needs based selection
  - Allows users to identify with a particular need that they are looking to meet
  - Increases in interest by offering contextual and relevant information without straining the user
 
Person based selection is usually more effective but depends on the business

The preference usability test
  - Gives users more time to evaluate two different design iterations
  - Give participants specific instructions and context
  - Great test for objective measure of clarity and figuring out which approach works for a specific page


9 - The Desire Stage of the Funnel: I Want What You Sell
Higher level of commercial commitment than the previous stages
Visitors will give you more time and attention
You cannot compel them to act prior to them being ready
Fill in any informational blank spaces
Website visitors transition from passive scanning to active reading during this stage

Trust and Security
  - One of the biggest blocks to conversions is a lack of trust and security
  - Often people are looking for tranactional assurances and social proof
  - Visitors must be allowed to determine the pace and direction of their relationship with a brand
 
Desirable actions -
  - People are still researching the product or service, facilitate with ebooks, white papers etc
  - They are also ofetn still looking at competitors, this is where differentiating yourself is very important
  - Visitors will often look for social proof eg reviews, recommendations even bad reviews are ok
  

10 - The Action Stage of the Funnel: I'm Going to Buy What You Sell
Highest level of commitment
Narural result of passing through previous stages
Products and Services differ at this stage
Products tend to be more towards practical information, services more towards psychological
Don't make people jump through any unnecessary hoops
Remove irrelevant distractions and unecessary words
Avoid any surprises


11 - The Fogg Behavior Model and how it Applies to Good Landing Page Design
Fogg Model - BJ Fogg Stanford University Professor
b = mat Behaviour = Motivation Ability Trigger
These must happen at the same time
Fogg Model has 3 types of motivation
  - Sensation
  - Anticipation
  - Social Cohesion
As you increase simplicty you increase ability and decrease perceived difficulty
3 Different Triggers 
  - Facilitators - Work with high motivation and low perceived difficulty
  - Sparks - Low on motivation high perceived difficulty
  - Signals - Straightforward no lack of motivtion or perceived difficulty
  

12 - Making Your Landing Page Design Memorable
Good design taps into the human lymbic system
Lymbic system responsible for emotion, attention, responses and memories
The lymbic system pursues pleasure and avoids pain as well as controlling spontaneous behaviour
People learn 3 ways
  - Visual 
    - images
    - colours
    - infographics
    - videos
    - tables
  - Audio
    - music
    - voice overs
    - phone calls
  - Kinesthetic
    - quizzes
    - games
    - role playing
People tend towards 1 of the 3 and there is no best way to design pages
Adding elements should not interfere with good design
Especially important during the desire & interest stages

2 - The Primacy of Product and The Concept of Usability in Landing Page Design
Nothing is more important than having a product or service that people need and want to buy
Consultative vs Commodity
Consultative means not using a supply and demand structure
Services can be either commoditised or consultative in nature, know which type will impact on your approach to marketing
Products are the same but tend to be commodities
Price is normally the number 1 determining factor
Commodities have an extrinsic value determined by the marketplace
Consultative businesses and unique products have an intrinsic value based on both the perceived value of the customer and
the conceived value of the seller
Every page on the site should broadly be able to account for the following factors
  - Useful - Useful information, context, calls to action, does it fill a need
  - Learnable - Can visitors learn to use the site without instruction
  - Memorable - Is it unique in a way that visitors remember as they look at competitors and consider options
  - Effective - Can users actually accomplish what they want to on your site
  - Efficient - Can visitors accomplish their goals with as little effort and mental energy as possible
  - Desirable - Do people actually want it
  - Delightful - Is there an experiential element to the site that excites people about your products or services
