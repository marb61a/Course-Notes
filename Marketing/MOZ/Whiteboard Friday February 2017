February 10th, 2017 - The Keyword + Year Content/Rankings Hack
The keyword-plus-year hack is the idea that you take a keyword that has some existing search volume, and you add on a date, either a 
month or a month and a year, and you are able to outrank many of the other players because it's a much less competitive space.
So let's say there are a good number of people every year who search for the best web designs. They want to get design inspiration, or 
they just want to see what's out there. They're looking for the design gallery, so they search for best web designs. Many times, though,
those folks will get results from the last 5 to 10 years, and they'll see those in there and they'll go, "You know, I want something 
more modern, more updated," and so they will revise their query to "best web designs 2016." In fact, many people even start with these 
queries. So they want to see the top Android games of January 2017. They want to see the best summer dishes 2017 for planning on 
cooking something. 
They're looking for something that is trendy. Maybe they're looking around fashion, or you see this a lot in searches around hairstyle or anything that is grading products or services. Who are the best real estate agents in Seattle? No, no, not the 2012 edition of "Seattle Met Magazine." I want 2017. Who are the best real estate agents in Seattle 2017? So they'll add this year on there. What's great is, because this year or month only happens as it happens, those searches only happen as we get to that time period, the keyword research will not expose it to you. So if, for example, let's make this 2017, so "best web designs 2017."

We're filming this Whiteboard Friday in January. There have only just started to be a few searches for best web designs 2017. There have only just started to be a few any keyword searches that include the word 2017, because 2017 has just started. Therefore, your competitors are not seeing those in their keyword research list. They're not targeting them. There's not a ton of content out there yet, and so it's easier. Even though the volume tends to be lower than the usual keyword — sometimes it's higher, but usually lower — you will find it is vastly easier to rank for, and it's also the case — this is sort of beautiful — if you're using this tactic, even though it's higher in volume to have "best web designs" versus "best web designs 2017," the one without the year, it is often the case that Google will bias to show more recent content, especially if there are lots of searches that get revised to include the temporal number or date.

That is awesome because it means that you can win twice. You can rank for this one, which, of course, the search volume for it will die off at the end of the year, but you might be able to rank for this one as well. If you keep that updated, and change it up, and add to it, retire the old one, move the old one over to an old URL, put the new one up at the new URL, or keep the same URL if you're trying to build on top of the link authority that you've built to that URL, you can have some awesome ranking and traffic power.

The process - How do you do this?
1. Conduct keyword research using:
NON-date keywords – You want to conduct the keyword research without using the date. I'm going to start with non-date keywords. So if I'm in Keyword Explorer, or if I'm doing my keyword research in AdWords, or wherever I am, I would search for "best web design," get a big list of my target keywords.
Last year + keywords – Then I would go look at last year numbers. For example, I would search for "2016 best web design" or "best web design 2016" or anything from my keyword export or list that includes years.
2–3 years ago + keywords – I would go two and three years ago, so that I could get a sense for the volume that includes the year. I would also be looking for month at this time.

2. Use Google Trends and/or SimilarWeb/Jumpshot Trends to ID seasonality
Then I'd use Google Trends, or if you're not a fan of Google Trends — they can be a little squirrely with some data — SimilarWeb and 
Jumpshot also have keyword trend data, at least at the head of the demand curve, that can be good, and try and identify some of that
seasonality. If you see that there's a high season that includes a particular month, that's often an indication that month plus year 
could be there, and then you can go and look in here. I could add "May 2016 best web design" to see if there was actually search volume 
for just the May keyword.

3. Use Google SERPs to determine if the month/year tactic is popular or underserved in your niche
Then I'm going to use Google SERPs. I'm going to check the keyword difficulty of those SERPs, and I'd probably look to see how many 
different outlets are producing monthly or annual content. For annual content, it's really going to be very January- and 
February-centric. That's when it all gets produced. Then, if it is underserved, that means there's more opportunity there, but, even 
still, it's almost always a lower difficulty, easier to get in there.

4. Target and create that timely content
So, to do that, you're going to be using:
Recent data. If I were creating a page to target "best web design 2017," I would want to use designs that have come out in the last
month only or maybe just at the very end of 2016.
Employ emerging trends and language. So maybe it's PWAs, maybe it is language around clean design, whatever the trends in the field are 
right now.
Serve the recency of the searcher's intent by giving them the ability or showing right up front that my data and my information is very 
recent and that I'm helping them with what's going now, not just historically.

5. Publish as early in the period as possible
You want to publish this content as early as you can in the period without doing it earlier. So what I don't want to do is have my 
launch be in December 2016. December is a very quiet period anyway. It's tough to get traction and attention, it's tough to build 
links, but it also can be the case that you won't hit the search algorithms as recency systems. Google has these algorithms called the 
QDF, query deserves freshness, and so if they see that you're producing that content a month or two months before it's actually the
right date, there's going to be skepticism, both from users who might stumble upon it or find it, but also from engines. 




February 3rd, 2017 - Refurbishing Top Content
Any of you watching likely have top content, either on your site or a client's site, that does really, really well. Whether that's 
getting the most traffic or converting the most users, it does really well. The problem is that we let it just sit there, and we're not
getting the amplification that we could out of that content. 

1 - Identify your site's top traffic pages.
Analytics is great for this and to further evaluate which of those pages are converting the highest, have the most engagements, and is
bringing in most of your traffic. It's super important to keep in mind that there are other forms of content. It's not always necessarily
just a page on your website. It could be a video somewhere, it could be a really great podcast, it could even be a printout, and I've run 
into this a few times where the information isn't currently digital, but they use it in a clinic or in an office setting that could do 
really great things for the website.

2 - Simplify and repurpose
For the sake of our example, I'm going with a long-form content of how to choose the right college. Maybe this brings in lots of applicants for a particular school or university. So what could they better be doing with this piece of content? So that brings us to step two, which is simplify and repurpose. We all want to consume information differently. There are different use cases, you name it. So to take a long-form piece of content and to put it together in a PowerPoint, really simplify it and break it up into slides. From there, you can use those slides or take new raw footage to make a really, really powerful video on how to choose the right college.

If you have these two steps done, you're kind of set up for success for images. You could either take images from your PowerPoint or your video and have really great informational text below it.

Lastly, audio, how easy would it be to take this long-form piece and to make it into an audio option or a podcast even, allowing your visitors maybe another option when they get to this page? So it's fun to experiment with that as well.
You can interweave some of these other forms of content back into the original piece, and now you're learning a lot more about your audience and a lot more about how they want to consume your content.

Step 3: Publish on popular platforms
I can already feel people getting really squeamish about this, but you shouldn't. Let me say there are two big reasons why you should be taking advantage of this. One, these are all really, really powerful sites. They rank really well. Two, they have a huge audience, and their audiences are actively seeking information that you're providing on your site. So if you're not going to be providing expertise and information on these sites, someone will, right? So you want to take advantage of that, and you want to take the opportunity.

So you could take your PowerPoint and upload it to SlideShare. SlideShare ranks so, so well. You could take your video and upload it to YouTube, with the caveat of putting it on Vimeo or Wistia first. You want to make sure that you are self-hosting for up to three months, and then you can transfer your video to YouTube. That way you're getting the authority of that video, and Youtube.com isn't ranking first for it.

Instagram is great for those images, but, again, I would always put the text below it and keep your images really clean and not have too much text on them, and then to obviously hashtag appropriately.

Then Pinterest, Quora, people are actively asking questions that you have all the answers to, so to be the expertise in the field and to take advantage of people asking, "How do I choose the right college?" Reddit and LinkedIn are other options to further amplify.

Step 4: Measure the referral metrics


Measure the impact of republishing on these sites. There are a couple of ways to do this. These are some of my favorite engagement metrics. So you have number of viewed pages, you have time on site, bounce rate is always good to look at, and, obviously, conversions. So this really starts to paint a picture of: Where are you seeing the qualified leads? Where is your qualified traffic coming from?

Then the next time you go to a new content strategy, maybe you leave out these three because you didn't get much traffic from them, but maybe you saw a bunch of qualified leads from SlideShare. So that brings you to pivot, like the "Friends" episode. It allows you to pivot.

So now, we have a strategy moving forward. We know what platforms work best for your website or your business, and you're kind of setting yourself up for success down the road.
