Friday April 14th, 2017 Launching a New Website: Your SEO Checklist
This week we're going to talk about launching a new website and the SEO process that you've got to go through. Now, it's not actually 
that long and cumbersome. But there are a few things that I put into broad categories, where if you do these as you're launching a
new site or before you launch that new site, your chances of having success with SEO long term and especially in those first few months
is going to go way up.
1. Keyword to URL map for your content
So let's get started with number one here. What I'm suggesting that you do is, as you look across the site that you've built, go and
do some keyword research. There are a lot of Whiteboard Fridays and blog posts that we've written here at Moz about great ways to do 
keyword research. But do that keyword research and create a list that essentially maps all of the keywords you are initially targeting
to all of the URLs, the pages that you have on your new website.
So it should look something like this. It's got the URL, so RandsAnimals.com, targeting the keyword "amazing animals," and here's the
page title and here's the meta description. Then, I've got RandsAnimals.com/lemurs, which is my page about lemurs, and that's 
targeting "lemurs" and "lemur habits." There's the title.
You want to go through these and make sure that if you have an important keyword that you have not yet targeted, you do so, and 
likewise, that if you've got a URL, a page on your website that you have not yet intentionally targeted a keyword with, you make sure
to do that as well. This can be a great way to go through a small site in the early stages and make sure that you've got some terms 
and phrases that you're actually targeting. This will be also helpful when you do your rank tracking and your on-page optimization 
later on.

2. Accessibility, crawl, and UX
So what I want you to do here is to ask yourself:
I. "Are the pages and the content on my website accessible to search engines?"
There are some great ways to check these. You can use something like Screaming Frog or Google Search Console. You could use Moz Pro, or
OnPage.org, to basically run a scan of your site and make sure that crawlers can get to all the pages, that you don't have duplicate
content, that you don't have thin content or pages that are perceived to have no content at all, you don't have broken links, 
you don't have broken pages, all that kind of good stuff.

II. "Is the content accessible to all audiences, devices, and browsers?"
Next, we're going to ask not about search engines and their crawlers, but about the audience, the human beings and whether your content is accessible to all the audiences, devices, and browsers that it could be. So this could mean things like screen readers for blind users, mobile devices, desktop devices, laptops, browsers of all different kinds. You're going to want to use a tool like a browser checker to make sure that Chrome, Firefox, and... What's Internet Explorer called now? Oh, man. They changed it. Microsoft Edge. Make sure that it works in all of them.

I like that I think that there's a peanut gallery who's going to yell it out. Like you're watching this at lunch and you're thinking, "Rand, if I yell it to you now, it won't be recorded." I know. I know.

III. "Do those pages load fast from everywhere?"
So I could use a tool like Google Speed Test. I can also do some proxy checking to make sure that from all sorts of regions, especially if I'm doing international targeting or if I know that I'm going to be targeting rural regions that my pages load fast from everywhere.

IV. "Is the design, UI, visuals, and experience enjoyable and easy for all users?"
You can do that with some in-house usability testing. You could do it informally with friends and family and existing customers if you have them. Or you could use something like Five Second Test or UsabilityHub to run some more formal testing online. Sometimes this can reveal things in your navigation or your content that's just stopping people from having the experience that you want — that's very easy to fix.

3. Setup of important services and tracking
Web analytics - Google Analytics is free and very, very popular. But you could also use something like Piwik, or if you're bigger,
Omniture. You're going to want to do a crawl. OnPage or Moz Pro, or some of these other ones will check to make sure that your 
analytics are actually loaded on all of your pages.
Uptime tracking - If you haven't checked them out, Pingdom has some very cheap plans for very early-stage sites. Then, if you get bigger, they can get more expensive and more sophisticated.
Retargeting and remarketing - Even if you don't want to pay now and you're not going to use any of the services, go ahead and put the retargeting pixels from at least Facebook and Google onto your website, on all of your pages, so that those audiences are accessible to you later on in the future.
Set up some brand alerts - The cheapest option is Google Alerts, which is free, but it's not very good at all. If you're using Moz Pro, there's Fresh Web Explorer alerts, which is great. Mention.net is also good, Talkwalker, Trackur. There's a number of options there that are paid and a little bit better.
Google Search Console - If you haven't set that up already, you're going to want to do that, as well as Bing Webmaster Tools. Both of those can reveal some errors to you. So if you have accessibility issues, that's a good free way to go.
Moz/Ahrefs/SEMRush/Searchmetrics/Raven/etc. - If you are doing SEO, chances are good that you're going to want to set up some type of an SEO tool to track your rankings and do a regular crawl, show you competitive opportunities and missteps, potentially show you link-building opportunities, all that kind of stuff. I would urge you to check out one of probably these five. There are a few other ones. But these five are pretty popular — Moz, Ahrefs, SEMRush, Searchmetrics, or Raven. Those are some of the best known ones certainly out there.
Social and web profiles - Again, important to set those up before you launch your new site, so that no one goes and jumps on the name of your Facebook page, or your Pinterest page, or your Instagram profile page, or your YouTube page, or your SlideShare page. I know you might be saying, "But Rand, I don't use SlideShare." No, not today. But you might in the future, and trust me, you're going to want to claim Rand's Animals on YouTube and SlideShare. You're going to want to claim whatever your website's name is. I'll go claim this one later. But you've got to set all those up, because you don't want someone else taking them later. I would urge you to go down the full list of all the social media sites out there, all the web profiles out there, just to make sure that you've got your brand secured.
4. Schema, rich snippets, OpenGraph, etc

Optimization in general, more broadly. So this is where I'm essentially going through these URLs and I'm making sure, "Hey, okay. I know I've targeted these keywords and I already did sort of my page title meta description. But let me check if there are other opportunities."

Are there content opportunities or image search opportunities? Do I have rich snippet opportunities? Like maybe, this is probably not the case, but I could have user review stars for my Rand's Animals website. I don't know if people particularly love this lemur GIF versus that lemur GIF. But those can be set up on your site, and you can see the description of how to do that on Google and Bing. They both have resources for that. The same is true for Twitter and Facebook, who offer cards so that you show up correctly in there. If you're using OpenGraph, I believe that also will correctly work on LinkedIn and other services like that. So those are great options.
5. Launch amplification & link outreach plan

So one of the things that we know about SEO is that you need links and engagement and those types of signals in order to rank well. You're going to want to have a successful launch day and launch week and even a launch month. That means, asking the question in advance:

I. "Who will help amplify your launch and why? Why are they going to do this?"


If you can identify, "These people, I know they personally want to help out," or, "They are friends and family. I have business relationships with them. They're customers of mine. They're journalists who promised to cover this. They are bloggers who care a lot about this subject and need stuff to write about." Whatever it is, if you can identify those people, create a list, and start doing that direct outreach, that is certainly something that you should do. I would plan in advance for that, and I would warn folks of when you were going to do that launch. That way, when launch day rolls around, you have some big, exciting news to announce. Two weeks after you launch to say, "Hey, I launched a new website a couple weeks ago," you're no longer news. You're no longer quite as special, and therefore your chances of coverage go down pretty precipitously after the first few days.

II. "What existing relationships, profiles, and sites should I update to create buzz (and accuracy)?"

I would also ask what existing relationships and websites and profiles do you already have that you can and should update to create buzz and actually to create accuracy. So this would be things like everything from your email signature to all your social profiles that we've talked about, both the ones you've claimed and the ones that you personally have. You should go and update your LinkedIn. You should go and update your Twitter page. You should go and update Facebook. All of those kinds of things, you may want to go and update. About.me if you have a profile there, or if you're a designer, maybe your Dribbble profile, whatever you've got.

*Then, you should also be thinking about, "Do I have content that I've contributed across the web over the years, on all sorts of other websites, where if I went and said, 'Hey, I've got a new site. Could you point to that new site, instead of my old one, or to my new site that I've just launched, instead of my old employer who I've left?'" you can do that as well, and it's certainly a good idea.

III. "What press coverage, social coverage, or influencer outreach can I do?"

The last thing I would ask about are people who are maybe more distant from you, but press coverage, social coverage, or influencer outreach, similar to the, "Who will help you amplify and why?" You should be able to make a list of those folks, those outlets, find some email addresses, send a pitch if you've got one, and start to build those relationships.

Launch day is a great reason to do outreach. When you're launching something new is the right time to do that, and that can help you get some amplification as well.



Friday April 7th, 2017
This week we're going to chat about how you can use your competitors' top pages, data from a number of reports, from a bunch of 
different tools about which pages are the most important, or highest ranked, or most linked to URLs on your competitors' websites, 
in order to boost your SEO efforts. There's a bunch of cool things that you can do with these, beyond the obvious.
5 kinds of "Top Pages" reports
So first off, there are really five kinds of top pages reports. These can be further filtered and augmented with data that you could 
craft or create, and some of these tools add in additional data too, so you could do other things with them. But basically, these five 
are:
1. Top pages by links
This is essentially what are the most linked to, either by URLs, or by root domains, or highest page authority, those kinds of things.
The three tools that have that are Moz, Ahrefs, and Majestic. They're the primary link tools out there on the web.
2. Top pages by social shares
This is looking at Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, Twitter. Important caveat on this, Moz technically has top pages by social shares,
but only from Facebook and Google Plus. Probably we'll be replacing Google Plus with LinkedIn soon. Ahrefs has it, but same story. 
They don't have Twitter data. BuzzSumo are the only folks who can show you Twitter data, but they only have it if they've already
recorded the URL and started tracking it, because Twitter took away the ability to see Twitter share accounts for any particular URL, 
meaning that in order for BuzzSumo to actually get that data, they have to see that page, put it in their index, and then start
collecting the tweet counts on it. So it's not perfect data, but they're certainly the best source as far as social share numbers go.
You can also get some data from SharedCount.com, but it's been sort of up and down lately.
3. Top pages by estimated search traffic
So this is essentially where SEMrush shines. Ahrefs also has this. Basically, what they're doing is they're looking at, "Here all the keywords that we've seen this URL or this path or this domain ranking for, and here is the estimated keyword volume." I think both SEMrush and Ahrefs are scraping Google AdWords to collect their keyword volume data. Actually, I think maybe Ahrefs is also doing what Moz does now, where they bolster that with data that they buy from Jumpshot or possibly another clickstream provider. So essentially they're saying, "These pages are the ones we think are getting the most organic search traffic." Super valuable report from both of those guys as well.

4. Top pages by number of ranking keywords

So this is different from estimated search traffic. There could be a page on a domain that only ranks for one keyword, but it gets tons of searches and it ranks number one, so it gets an incredible amount of search traffic. But there could be pages that rank for a ton of different keywords, but they rank number 6 through 10, or they rank number 11 through 50, and they rank for all these different numbers of keywords, but none of them particularly well or none of them all that awesome, and so they don't show up in the top estimated search traffic reports. Again, SEMrush and Ahrefs provide those.

5. Top pages by total traffic

So this would be SimilarWeb and Jumpshot provide these. Alexa does too. I mean Alexa, not Amazon's voice search app, but the old Alexa rankings system. Why did they name them both the same thing? It makes it really confusing. Does it frustrate you? It frustrates me. So you can use SimilarWeb or Jumpshot to see the top pages by total traffic. So that's all sources, that's search traffic, social traffic, direct, email, links, etc., etc.

Problems to solve/questions to answer

These five I'm going to reference as we dive into problems to solve and questions to answer. But before we do that, I'm a little under the weather, so I'm going to blow my nose. I know this is unusual on Whiteboard Friday, but you don't want to see anything gnarly happening on the video. This is the proof that we only do one shot, that I really do one take.

A. What is my competition doing that's bringing them success along various vectors?

This is the most obvious one. This is the one that everybody uses the top pages reports for. So they go, "Okay, what is the most linked to? What has the most social shares?" Fine, so I can see what content has been most successful in any different one along any of those vectors. It's obvious, it's good to use, it can answer some questions, but check out these other ones.

B. Where has my competition created broad content, leaving gaps of specific queries I can fill?

Potentially fill with answer boxes, featured snippets, I could potentially fill by having a more targeted page that answers that query directly better, and so doesn't need as many links to rank, because it's very, very hyper-targeted? You can do that by looking at things that your competition has done really well on number four, top pages by number of ranking keywords, but has not done as well with total organic estimated search traffic. The gap between those two will give you those kinds of content opportunities, hyper-focused content and keyword targeting opportunities, which is killer.

C. What content has done really well, like resonated with social or direct traffic audiences, but then it's done poorly in SEO?

So, for that, I can look at number two, top pages by social shares, or number five, by total traffic, but then look at ones that have performed poorly on number of keywords and estimated search traffic.

D. What content has helped my competitors grow their link profile, but may not be ranking or maybe it used to be ranking, but it's not ranking anymore because they haven't kept the content up to date?

Maybe people were looking for stuff around 2017, and they created this content way back in 2015, and even though they got a bunch of links to it, it's just not ranking that well anymore. These are huge opportunities, and so you can look for number one being very high, high number of links, but lower number of ranking keywords and estimated search traffic.

E. What content is low on links, but high on getting search traffic and getting lots of keywords ranking for it?

Which means that there's a strong opportunity that if you can out link build them, you can probably overtake them. Because if it's weak on number of links, but it's strong on estimated search traffic and number of ranking keywords, there's probably a golden opportunity.

So you can see how by mixing and matching these things and by comparing top pages data from multiple sources against one another, you can get some really cool, powerful, advanced SEO opportunities in your content and keyword targeting.
