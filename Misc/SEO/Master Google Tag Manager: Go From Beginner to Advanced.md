1. Why GTM Exists?
  -
  - Using the Hotjar tool to demonstrate a small piece of code that needs to be installed on a site so that it works
    - https://www.hotjar.com/ 
    - Hotjar is a heatmap tool which analyses where and how long a users spends on a site
    - There is a small piece of JS to install
  - Many applications now use code snippets to integrate with a website
  - These snippets can be and usually are called tags
  - These tags are normally installed in the head section of the HTML
    - Each page that is to be tracked will need to have the tag added 
  - There are multiple different types of tag available such as Facebook Pixel, Heatmaps etc
  - Too many tags being added to a site can make it very hard to manage
  - This is where a tag manager comes in, it allows tags to be used without being in the website code where issues may occur
  - All that will be seen in the HTML code will be a list of tags
  - There are multiple tag managers available Google Tag Manager (GTM) is only one
  - The course will cover how the different tags work with GTM
