Morals & Ethics
  - There are some things to consider when investigating a site from a technical perspective
  - Provide Solutions over Problems
    - When conducting a site audit it is very easy to provide problems
    - These problems observed in isolation rarely give any context to cause or solutions
    - Problems should be quoted specifically, the scale and the solutions to the problem
    - Root causes are essential to issues being fully understood
  - Work with team members
    - Analysis of sites and discovery of solutions and problems needs to be communicated to all parties effectively
    - Providing problems and solutions helps with this and can be provided in different ways to different audiences
    - Team members may not know technical jargon or reasoning behind decisions
  - Crawling Ethics
    - Ensure that permission is granted before crawling a site, check before hand
    - There will be times when anti-crawling software will be in place
  - General Ethics
    - Do not break the law
    - Always follow best practice
    - Do the best thing for a client
    - Do not provide clients with misleading information

The Basics - Hosting
  - There are 2 types of host that need to be known
    - Web Hosts which is where content is stored
    - Domain Hosts which is where information on domain names is stored
  - Web Hosting
    - In order for content to be published on the internet there needs to be a place to publish it, in this case a website
    - This site has to be hosted somewhere
    - When a user requests a web address that is on your site, the server that hosts the website talks with the request and if able then fulfills it
    - The web site hosting can either be with a company or hosted yourself.
  - Hosted vs Self-Hosted
    - Hosted sites are typically built with site builders such as Wix, WordPress or Squarespace
    - Self-Hosted sites are usually easier to customise but this needs to be carefully done
    - When self hosting a lot of work that external hosts do needs to be done such as running backups
  - Shared vs Dedicated Hosting
    - Once a hosted solution has been decided on then it is time to decide on either shared or dedicated hosting
    - Shared is much cheaper and is better for those with limited technical skills as there will not be as many options
    - Dedicated Hosting is good for technical minded people and is like owning your own home
  - What should a good host do
    - Provide excellent technical support when needed
    - There should be the option to have either a dedicated or shared server
    - There should be no problem scaling as demand increases
    - There should be a focus on security
    - Additional functionality should be available such as the ability to whitelist IP Addresses
  - Content Delivery Networks (CDN's) 
    - Although not strictly necessary for a website there are advantages to using them
    - They are a group of servers which are distributed around the globe allowing for faster worldwide content delivery
    - They can be used in addition to web hosting as they allow for content caching on their servers
    - They inprove both performance and security and they reduce dependence on a single server thus improving uptime

Networking
  - Protocols
    - There are multiple protocols used to ensure that servers talk to one another and users get their data
     - IP which is used for network routing
     - TCP which ensures data is delivered reliably
     - HTTP which transfers data between devices
     - HTTPS which is an encrypted version of HTTP and is used more
     - TLS/SSL which is the encryption that HTTTPS uses 
  - Header Requests
    - After a web address has been typed into a browser a request is then sent to a server
    - It contains various information that allows the server to tailor it's response
     - Requested URI, Host, The type of data accepted by the browser, a User Agent, Source IP
  - Header Responses
    - Depending on the information that is sent to the server in the header request, the server will then respond with its own headers 
    - After this then if the browser is allowed to view content, it will begin downloading HTML from the server using details from the response
