    - This site has to be hosted somewhere
    - When a user requests a web address that is on your site, the server that hosts the website talks with the request and if able then fulfills it
    - The web site hosting can either be with a company or hosted yourself.
  - Hosted vs Self-Hosted
    - Hosted sites are typically built with site builders such as Wix, WordPress or Squarespace
    - Self-Hosted sites are usually easier to customise but this needs to be carefully done
    - When self hosting a lot of work that external hosts do needs to be done such as running backups
