<h1><p align=center>How Does Search Work </h1><br/>  
  
Market Share of Search Engines
  -
  - There are 5 dominant search engines
    - Google - https://www.google.com/
    - Bing - https://www.bing.com/
    - Yahoo - https://ie.yahoo.com/
    - Yandex - https://yandex.com/
    - Baidu - https://www.baidu.com/
  - Duck Duck Go is another search engine available but the course concentrates on the 5 above
    - https://duckduckgo.com/
  - Google is by the market leader with about 93% share
  - Bing and Yahoo largely return the same result as Bing powers a lot of Yahoo
  - Yandex is Russian and it's audience is mostly Russian speaking, Baidu is the same but for China

SERP features & Google Horizontals  
  -
  - Google's results have evolved considerably but not affected their dominance
  - Google SERP's continue to change and new features are added and removed
  - Google adverts will have a box saying Ad beside the URL
    - This kind of result will not be covered in the course as they are not organic search results
  - Structure data and Rich results will have a large impact on rankings
    - More information on the kind of technical factor is available in notes at
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md
  - Depending on what is being searched for there will be a knowledge card on the right of the search results
    - This can contain aggregated information from different sources
    - It is hard for a single site to fully own this
    - It is easier for companies to own this if they have filled out Google MyBusiness of Google Brand Account
    - Using MyBusiness and Brand Account can help getting location specific maps appearing on the main SERP page
  - Horizontals refer to the list of search tabs such as News, Videos, Images etc
  - Many of the listings found on the Shopping horizontal are paid for listings

Crawling, Rendering and Indexing
  - More information on the kind of technical factor is available in notes at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 
  - Crawling, rendering and indexing is how a page appears in the SERP's
    - These are independent of a page's rankings in the SERP's
  - https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics
  - If Google encounters a noindex prior to executing JavaScript then the page will not render
  - Orphan pages are pages that a page lacks links from other pages on a site
  - https://www.danielmorell.com/guides/htaccess-seo

The Notion of Crawl Budget
  -
  - Again more information can be found at the following URL
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 
  - Most sites do not need to worry abount crawl budget as it is only sites over 1000 pages that start having issues

Basics of HTML DOM, What it is and why it's important
  -
  - Again more information can be found at the following URL
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 

JavaScript and modern Web frameworks
  -
  - Again more information can be found at the following URL
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 
  - JavaScript is a very technical topic for anyone new to SEO
  - Search engines find it easier to process pure HTML versus JavaScript
  - JavaScript is great for aesthetics and features but not so good for search engines
  - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ultimate-guide-javascript-seo-syed-faraz-abbas-rizvi
  - There is no reason to use JS for aesthetics if they can be created without it
  - Search engines cannot do onClick() events
  - Not using JS properly can result in Google thinking that a site is trying cloaking
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking
    - Using cloaking will have consequences for a site's SERP rankings

Black Hat SEO vs White Hat SEO
  -
  - Black Hat SEO describes optimisation techniques that go against guidelines
    - Techniques that follow guidelines are called WhiteHat
  - Avoid Black hat techniques like the plague
    - They are usually only successful for a short period of time
    - The penalties that a site will receive often far outweigh any benefits
  - Google updates the search algorithm several times a year
    - Each time there are winners and losers but not every loss is a penalty
  - Greyhat is a term which describes techniques which are not against search guidelines but do contradict ethics
    - Link building can be an example of Grayhat activities
    - https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies?hl=en&visit_id=638114020697901476-3303849116&rd=1#link-spam
    - Technically anybody reaching out for links can be seen as greyhat but as long as honest efforts are done there is little risk

<h1><p align=center>SEO Strategies </h1><br/>

How to identify your SEO strategy
  -
  - Identifying an SEO strategy early is important so that you are aware what needs to be done with a site
    - This should take into account any challenges that there are within the business
  - 4 common pillars of strategy to maximise results
    - How your site currently performs, what are its strengths and weaknesses
      - This shows where is performing and where performance is not meeting expectations
      - Without knowing where a site is at the moment performancewise it will be very hard to know where to target improvements
    - Who your real competitors are
      - When working with businesses they should know who their competitors are
      - In this case the real means competitors in the SERP's rather than shops etc
    - What are the goals of the business
      - This is something that often be overlooked by businesses
      - The purpose of SEO is not just to rank high for certain queries
      - If this cannot be measured against business goals then calculating returns on any investment is going to be tough
      - Everything that will be done should always start with understanding what purpose it serves
    - Identify who the key enablers are
      - SEO is not something that is easy because there are many different elements
      - Find the things that will drive results as fast as is possible
      - An SEO strategy is usually a 6 to 12 month exercise
  - Start thinking as early as possible about SEO
    - This should include yourself and how you will approach things
  - The one size fits all formula does not exist
    - There are multiple factors that will affect your strategy
    - The strength of a site such as its size, authority, reputation and others
      - Is the site a new one or has it been online for several years
      - There should be as much understanding of these as possible as they will affect SEO strategy and it they are wrong so then will be the strategy
    - The industry that a size is involved in
      - Different niches will have different strategies as what works in another industry will not work in yours
    - The Competition Landscape
      - Some niches will have low volumes of queries
      - If competition is low this can still work well
      - Again if there are low volumes for searches in a niche this will have an effect on SEO strategy 
    - The site market (Is it local or international)
      - Is the main part of where a site is selling to located locally or will there be shipments abroad
      - Understand where your market is today as well as how it is likely to evolve otherwise opportunities may be missed
      - This covers a period of the next 6 to 12 months
    - The type of site that a site is such as whether its an e-commerce site, blog, forum etc
      - Each of these type of sites comes with their own unique challenges
      - E-commerce sites for example can be very challenging to put together an SEO strategy for
      - Blogs that have lots of comments, guest posts etc and other type of content need to be fully understood
    - What are the business goals
      - How much brand awareness or how much revenue is expected from organic search will affect SEO strategy
      - Not having an initial expectation or initial goals may not be a bad thing as it will give time for proper early discussions
    - Budget and Resources available
      - Simply put the more resources available then the more options are available
      - One example is having access to developers or specialist SEO experts eg Backlink specialists
      - Being in a smaller business without access to some of these is not necessarily going to prevent success
      - SEO is not tied to how much money can be spent on an SEO strategy
  - The course structure
    - Improving SEO skills
      - The course will drastically improve SEO skills as well as confidence
    - Answering what the 4 pillars of SEO are
    - Maximise the chances of success and the ROI
  
SEO Roadmap Template
  -
  - Downloadable template

Creating your mid-term SEO strategy
  -
  - Quick review of the Roadmap Template which will be updated by the student as the course progresses
    - The 6 - 12 month timeframe is envisaged
  - Examples of Situations
    - Where a site is new or has low visibility
      - There are not any magic formulas but only guidelines and pointers
      - Focus on content as if there is little content it will be very tough to bring traffic
        - Look within the niche to see what the audience is interested in or talking about
        - If running an ecommerce site it maybe worth starting a blog around the niche your site focuses on
        - Make sure that the content is properly optimised and uses keywords that will convert
      - Go after low volume and low competition keywords
        - New sites with low visibility and low authority will not be able to go after competitive keywords
        - Newer sites will probably be better targeting low volume long tail keywords
      - Structure the site properly
        - Being low visibility gives an opportunity for information architecture to be implemented correctly
        - Make sure that everything on site flows well for users as well as search engines
        - While a site is still new it means that changes needed can be made much more easily 
      - Quality over Quantity
        - Its better to have less than 50 pages that are well organized than 1000's that are not
        - Make sure that the small number of pages are keyword optimised and offer great value to users
        - Remember that thin content does not bring any value
    - A site is up against fierce competition
      - Most industries are very competitive today, any that aren't usually will be within a couple of years
      - Focus on sub-niches when it is possible
        - If there is a specific part of the niche which has good demand then that should be focused on
      - Identify the weak spot of competition
        - Are there things that competitors are not doing well that you could focus on and do better
        - Breaking dow things may show pockets of opportunities when you can get ahead despite the fierce competition 
      - Set the right expectations internally
        - Stakeholders may not appreciate how much effort is involved when competition is very high
        - It is the responsibility of the SEO to set those expectations correctly
        - Demonstrate that you have taken into account the high competition to give confidence to stakeholders and avoid disappointment
      - Go after highly targeted keywords
        - These will convert well because the volume is low
        - Even with fierce competition there will be room for you if using the correct long tail keywords
    - A site that does not have a strong backlink profile
      - Backlink profiles are always difficult because it will be an area where a site is not in control
      - A high quality keyword can be better for a site than lots of low quality backlinks
      - Identify the gap in the backlinks profile
        - Find out how big this gap is, look at competition and how many backlinks that they have
        - See which are genuine backlinks and how quickly these backlinks were acquired
        - Is there a process that the competition uses to acquire backlinks
      - Outsource digital PR (If possible)
        - If resources are available then it maybe possible to work with an agency
      - Improve and optimise internal linking
        - It acquiring backlinks is proving very challenging then one thing to do is improve internal linking
        - Although they are not backlinks internal links can be very powerful as they help search engine crawlers
          - Optimizing with anchor text will help to improve SERP ranking
        - This approach can bring very good results so might be a good place to focus some of an SEO strategy on
      - Have a process in place which makes you consistent
        - Many businesses are not consistent and tend to work in waves
        - Instead of not doing anything for a period and then trying to rush instead try and do some work regularly even if it is small
        - SEO can be a lot about consistency
    - A site has technical issues
      - Fix in priority can be usually quick wins
        - Sites for example that are fast on desktop but slow on mobile can be first for fixes
        - Google rewards sites that are quick on mobile devices so getting issues fixed quickly can be rewarded quickly  
      - Migrate the site
        - Changing the website hosting can be a fix for several issues 
        - This can be a stressful time but it is often something that is better to get done rather than leave it until later on
        - If there are too many issues that are not being fixed on present hosters then it may be the only answer
      - Outsource if it is needed
        - If the knowledge is not available in-house to fix things then contracting out maybe the best option
        - This can in some circumstances a one time expense
      - Prioritise the issues
        - Not all issues can or will need to be fixed all at once 
        - The main thing is that issues are identified so that they are at least recognised
      - Monitor any fixes
        - Have processes in place that monitor fixes to ensure that the same issues do not reoccur 

Producing Your SEO Roadmap
  - A run through of the different elements of the SEO roadmap template
  - Tips and Best Practices
    - All sites evolve as do users and search engines
      - User behaviour and search engines are changing significantly 
      - Google for example releases core and minor updates on a regular basis
    - The competitors of today may not be the ones of tomorrow
      - Newer competitors may enter the market so there is a need to be proactive in understanding these   
    - SEO is an ongoing processes
      - What maybe successful for a site now may not be in the future
      - Doing nothing to prepare for these changes will see a site's rank fall over time 
  - Key Takeaways
    - SEO strategy should have answers to the 4 pillars
    - Update the SEO roadmap as the course progresses

<h1><p align=center>Site Audit : Checklist & Requirements </h1><br/>

Why Audit your site and how often should you do it?
  -
  - Downloadable resource
  - The document covers in some braod terms some of the things needed in an SEO technical audit as well as what to look out for
 
Audit Requirements
  -
  - What is a new client checklist
    - This is a document provided to clients with checklists to fill out and questions to answer
    - It allows for understanding of a client's industry as well as asking for certain things which allow for sites to be audited
    - There will be multiple things asked for in a client checklist
  - What should the new client checklist contain
    - There should be access to a number of tools such as GSC, Google Analytics, Bing Webmaster Tools, Google Tag Manager
    - Information about the site such as Internationalisation, Domain History and any major competitors
    - Detailed technical information about the site such as crawling permissions and their speed, user agents to whitelist as well as any pain points
      - User agents may be provided to the client so that they can be whitelisted to avoid crawling being blocked
      - Pain points should also be disclosed in case the client knows and already has fixes being processed 
    - Log Files to determine which pages Googlebot is visiting vs user vising
      - These can be used with other technical findings 
    - Some wider business questions such as company objectives within the next couple of years
      - What is the Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
      - What is the core company mission and what are it's core values  
    - Marketing such as what campaigns are currently ongoing
      - What campaigns have been ran previously
      - Has there been an SEO agency been used before and if so then what did they do 
    - Having all of the above answered in not completely necessary but it is a good thing to have
  - What we need to perform a technical audit of a site
    - Access to the site and permission to crawl
      - This is needed to understand the site and the technical setup   
    - Google Search Console (GSC) and Bing Webmaster Tools
      - This is Google's interface with webmasters, Bing tools should also be used if the client has them
      - Google Search Console will be sufficient if Bing is not available
    - Google Analytics
      - This will make available in-depth data for the client's site 
      - If there are other packages available such as Adobe Analytics that would be good but not absolutely necessary
    - The specific site pain points that the site owners are aware of
    - Domain History such as if the domain was owned by someone else
      - If the domain was recently bought or the client has other domains is valuable information to know 
    - Log Files have an abundance of information for performing a technical audit
  
Enabling & Configuring Google Search Console
  -
  - Search Google for 'Search Console' and this is the first result that will be found
    - https://search.google.com/search-console/about 
  - It is an interface between you and Google for reporting on your website
  - It can really help improve site performance within the SERP's
  - GSC offers reports on multiple areas
  - Users will need to add a domain manually
    - There are also instructions for adding GSC to your DNS provider
    - The whole domain does not have to be tracked, the URL prefix option allows for adding GSC to a certain part of the site
    - It is important when using the URL Prefix option that the canonical version is use
  - After the site has been added then it must be verified so that GSC can start receiving data
    - One option is to download a html file and add it to your website
    - Another option is to use Google Tag manager and add a tag to your site 
  - In order to keep GSC working it is important not to delete either the tag or html file which ever was added to the site
  - If GSC has already been added to a site then you will need to be added as an admin
    - Users can then be added with specific permissions 
  - Getting added by the site owner as a contibutor is much easier than verifying a site
  - Fetching a url for the first time may take a couple of minutes
  
Enabling & Configuring Google Analytics (GA)
  -
  - Search for Google Analytics and the first result will be the analytics site
    - https://analytics.google.com
    - Users will have to be signed in to their Google account 
    - Google Analytics is a free tool
    - It provides a lot of analytics in one place which allows for organisations to make smarter decisions
  - Why you should use Google Analytics over a different provider
    - Google Analytics has a lot of room in the free tier, approximately 10 million hits per month
    - In some instances Analytics 360 which is paid might be a better option
    - If you go over the limits of Google Analytics then you might start getting sampled data
    - Unless your site is getting an enormous amount of traffic then GA is the perfect tool
  - Enabling Google Analytics
    - Simply click the start measuring button
    - This takes you to a create account window where account details and other things will need to be entered
    - Try making the account name something that makes sense
    - You can track websites, mobile apps or both together
    - Once successfully set up, you should be presented with a gtag.js tag
      - This is the tracking code for the site   
      - This tag has to be in the head section of every page that you wish to track
      - Different platforms such as WordPress will have their own ways to allow this tag to be added eg the tracking id can be added in WP
    - GA has multiple customisable filters and settings to allow for fine grained data analysis

Technical Audit Checklist
  - 
  - Downloadable text resource
  - This is an Excel spreadsheet allowing for checking for site issues

Working with your Audit Checklist
  -
  - What is Technical Auditing
    - Technical auditing is the process of looking at a site from a technical perspective
    - We will be looking for any technical issues or problems
    - There will not be any looking at backlinks or keywords
    - If any issues are found they should be documented
    - There can be 3 stages within the documentation process
      - What is the issue that is occuring
      - Why this issue is an issue in the first place
      - How can this issue be fixed 
  - Why do we audit
    - Audting is a vital part of any SEO initiative
    - It not only highlights issues but guides strategy over the next 3 - 12 months 
    - There is little point in working on other SEO items if a site is not technically sound
    - Sites with a solid technical foundation help search engines understand a site better
    - Sites that are better understood by tsearch engines tend to rank better
    - Auditing helps identify issues that a search engine may see and provides recommendations for fixes
