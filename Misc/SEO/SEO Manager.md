<p align=center>How Does Search Work <br/>  
  
Market Share of Search Engines
  - There are 5 dominant search engines
    - Google - https://www.google.com/
    - Bing - https://www.bing.com/
    - Yahoo - https://ie.yahoo.com/
    - Yandex - https://yandex.com/
    - Baidu - https://www.baidu.com/
  - Duck Duck Go is another search engine available but the course concentrates on the 5 above
    - https://duckduckgo.com/
  - Google is by the market leader with about 93% share
  - Bing and Yahoo largely return the same result as Bing powers a lot of Yahoo
  - Yandex is Russian and it's audience is mostly Russian speaking, Baidu is the same but for China

SERP features & Google Horizontals  
  -
  - Google's results have evolved considerably but not affected their dominance
  - Google SERP's continue to change and new features are added and removed
  - Google adverts will have a box saying Ad beside the URL
    - This kind of result will not be covered in the course as they are not organic search results
  - Structure data and Rich results will have a large impact on rankings
    - More information on the kind of technical factor is available in notes at
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md
  - Depending on what is being searched for there will be a knowledge card on the right of the search results
    - This can contain aggregated information from different sources
    - It is hard for a single site to fully own this
    - It is easier for companies to own this if they have filled out Google MyBusiness of Google Brand Account
    - Using MyBusiness and Brand Account can help getting location specific maps appearing on the main SERP page
  - Horizontals refer to the list of search tabs such as News, Videos, Images etc
  - Many of the listings found on the Shopping horizontal are paid for listings
