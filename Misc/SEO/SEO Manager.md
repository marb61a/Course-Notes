<p align=center>How Does Search Work <br/>  
  
Market Share of Search Engines
  -
  - There are 5 dominant search engines
    - Google - https://www.google.com/
    - Bing - https://www.bing.com/
    - Yahoo - https://ie.yahoo.com/
    - Yandex - https://yandex.com/
    - Baidu - https://www.baidu.com/
  - Duck Duck Go is another search engine available but the course concentrates on the 5 above
    - https://duckduckgo.com/
  - Google is by the market leader with about 93% share
  - Bing and Yahoo largely return the same result as Bing powers a lot of Yahoo
  - Yandex is Russian and it's audience is mostly Russian speaking, Baidu is the same but for China

SERP features & Google Horizontals  
  -
  - Google's results have evolved considerably but not affected their dominance
  - Google SERP's continue to change and new features are added and removed
  - Google adverts will have a box saying Ad beside the URL
    - This kind of result will not be covered in the course as they are not organic search results
  - Structure data and Rich results will have a large impact on rankings
    - More information on the kind of technical factor is available in notes at
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md
  - Depending on what is being searched for there will be a knowledge card on the right of the search results
    - This can contain aggregated information from different sources
    - It is hard for a single site to fully own this
    - It is easier for companies to own this if they have filled out Google MyBusiness of Google Brand Account
    - Using MyBusiness and Brand Account can help getting location specific maps appearing on the main SERP page
  - Horizontals refer to the list of search tabs such as News, Videos, Images etc
  - Many of the listings found on the Shopping horizontal are paid for listings

Crawling, Rendering and Indexing
  - More information on the kind of technical factor is available in notes at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 
  - Crawling, rendering and indexing is how a page appears in the SERP's
    - These are independent of a page's rankings in the SERP's
  - https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics
  - If Google encounters a noindex prior to executing JavaScript then the page will not render
  - Orphan pages are pages that a page lacks links from other pages on a site
  - https://www.danielmorell.com/guides/htaccess-seo

The Notion of Crawl Budget
  -
  - Again more information can be found at the following URL
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 
  - Most sites do not need to worry abount crawl budget as it is only sites over 1000 pages that start having issues

Basics of HTML DOM, What it is and why it's important
  -
  - Again more information can be found at the following URL
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 

JavaScript and modern Web frameworks
  -
  - Again more information can be found at the following URL
    - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Misc/SEO/Technical SEO.md 
  - JavaScript is a very technical topic for anyone new to SEO
  - Search engines find it easier to process pure HTML versus JavaScript
  - JavaScript is great for aesthetics and features but not so good for search engines
  - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ultimate-guide-javascript-seo-syed-faraz-abbas-rizvi
  - There is no reason to use JS for aesthetics if they can be created without it
  - Search engines cannot do onClick() events
  - Not using JS properly can result in Google thinking that a site is trying cloaking
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking
    - Using cloaking will have consequences for a site's SERP rankings

Black Hat SEO vs White Hat SEO
  -
  - Black Hat SEO describes optimisation techniques that go against guidelines
    - Techniques that follow guidelines are called WhiteHat
  - Avoid Black hat techniques like the plague
    - They are usually only successful for a short period of time
    - The penalties that a site will receive often far outweigh any benefits
  - Google updates the search algorithm several times a year
    - Each time there are winners and losers but not every loss is a penalty
  - Greyhat is a term which describes techniques which are not against search guidelines but do contradict ethics
    - Link building can be an example of Grayhat activities
    - https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies?hl=en&visit_id=638114020697901476-3303849116&rd=1#link-spam
    - Technically anybody reaching out for links can be seen as greyhat but as long as honest efforts are done there is little risk

<p align=center>SEO Strategies <br/>

How to identify your SEO strategy
  -
  - Identifying an SEO strategy early is important so that you are aware what needs to be done with a site
    - This should take into account any challenges that there are within the business
  - 4 common pillars of strategy to maximise results
    - How your site currently performs, what are its strengths and weaknesses
      - This shows where is performing and where performance is not meeting expectations
      - Without knowing where a site is at the moment performancewise it will be very hard to know where to target improvements
    - Who your real competitors are
      - When working with businesses they should know who their competitors are
      - In this case the real means competitors in the SERP's rather than shops etc
    - What are the goals of the business
      - This is something that often be overlooked by businesses
      - The purpose of SEO is not just to rank high for certain queries
      - If this cannot be measured against business goals then calculating returns on any investment is going to be tough
      - Everything that will be done should always start with understanding what purpose it serves
    - Identify who the key enablers are
      - SEO is not something that is easy because there are many different elements
      - Find the things that will drive results as fast as is possible
      - An SEO strategy is usually a 6 to 12 month exercise
  - Start thinking as early as possible about SEO
    - This should include yourself and how you will approach things
  - The one size fits all formula does not exist
    - There are multiple factors that will affect your strategy
    - The strength of a site such as its size, authority, reputation and others
      - Is the site a new one or has it been online for several years
      - There should be as much understanding of these as possible as they will affect SEO strategy and it they are wrong so then will be the strategy
    - The industry that a size is involved in
      - Different niches will have different strategies as what works in another industry will not work in yours
    - The Competition Landscape
      - Some niches will have low volumes of queries
      - If competition is low this can still work well
      - Again if there are low volumes for searches in a niche this will have an effect on SEO strategy 
    - The site market (Is it local or international)
      - Is the main part of where a site is selling to located locally or will there be shipments abroad
      - Understand where your market is today as well as how it is likely to evolve otherwise opportunities may be missed
      - This covers a period of the next 6 to 12 months
    - The type of site that a site is such as whether its an e-commerce site, blog, forum etc
      - Each of these type of sites comes with their own unique challenges
