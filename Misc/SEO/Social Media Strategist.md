<p align=center>Course 05 - Creating the Social Media Policy <br/>
  
An overview of common situations but there may need to be legal considerations taken into account in certain situations
so advice on those maybe needed from a qualified person.

A social media policy is a formal written document which outlines best practices for
 - Monitoring the results of social media outreach to ensure proper disclosure and truthfulness, including best practices 
    for good-faith efforts to attempt to correct misstatements and misrepresentations.
 - Ensuring that employees as well as social media vendors, agencies, and subcontractors that act on behalf of the company 
    act properly
 - Outlining how businesses should interact with external bloggers, social media sites, advocates, and other communities.
 - Ensuring truthfulness, disclosure and honesty in all social media communications, publications, and interactions.
It should be written with safeguaring the organisation in mind and also will serve as a reference point for incident response.

The Disclosure Best Practices Toolkit from SocialMedia.org is a series of checklists to help you create a social media policy for 
your company. It is now retired but still available here
 - http://socialmedia.org/disclosure/

In the US the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the federal government agency in the United States that protects consumers 
by stopping unfair, deceptive or fraudulent practices in the marketplace. Its Truth in Advertising regulations are most relevant
to social media activities and revolve around three basic principles
  - Endorsements must be truthful and not misleading
  - If the advertiser doesn’t have proof that an endorser’s experience represents what consumers will achieve by using the 
    product, the ad must clearly and conspicuously disclose the generally expected results in the depicted circumstances
  - If there’s a connection between the endorser and the marketer of the product that would affect how people evaluate 
    the endorsement, it should be disclosed
In Ireland some more information can be found at
  - http://www.irelandip.com/articles/social-media/
  - http://www.irishsocialmedia.com/staying-legal/
 
Some broad principles on online endorsements and testimonials
 - If employees post anything about your company's products online, they must identify themselves as employees of the company.
 - Stay up-to-date on regulations and regularly update your organizational policies and procedures. 
 - Perform periodic audits of your content and associated posts, including comments, for violations of regulations and organizational
   policies.
 - Educate all stakeholders who interact with social media so that know your organization's policies and regulations.
 - Disclose all material relationships.

Intellactual Property (IP) has multiple definitions but the World Intellectual Property Organization defines it as refers to creations
of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
There are mechanisms in place to protect the inventor or creator of the IP, insuring that they are the only entities to receive 
recognition and financial benefit for their IP
 - A copyright © gives creators right to their literary and artistic works. 
 - A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention. 
 - A trademark ™is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one organization from those of other organizations.
Some examples from social media would be would be 
 - Original photographs posted by the photographer 
 - Music that is purchased and downloaded from an online store.
 
Sometimes on Social Media users can unknowingly use protected content eg reposting blog etc. Fair Use is a term which allows for the
use of copyrighted material. This does not usually apply to commercial cases as Fair Use does not allow for making a profit from the
violation of copyright. Many social media sites provide some license to share content in their terms of service. There are a couple
of ways in which to legally use protected content
 - Buy out the copyright owner’s rights completely 
 - Obtain a license to use the content

Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that facilitates free and easy-to-use copyright licenses that provide the public with a 
way to share and use protected content. The owner of the content can change copyright terms from “all rights reserved” to “some rights
reserved”. There are multiple licenses available which cover a wide spectrum of uses

There a couple of major types of Brand Abuse
Brandjacking - When someone deceptively hijacks a brand in order to sell products or conduct fraudulent activities. Consumers are 
tricked because they trust the real brand. One example is where a company makes a new type of cracker and puts a logo on the box 
that looks like the Nabisco logo.
Cybersquatting - The practice of abusing trademarks within the domain name system. Brand names—spelled correctly or, in a practice
known as typosquatting, spelled incorrectly—are used within a domain name, enabling the squatter to divert web traffic meant for a 
legitimate site to an illicit site which may sell counterfeit goods, utilize pay-per-click abuse, host adult content or conduct 
other illicit activity.

Trade secrets encompass all Information that is essential to the core business practices of organizations, such as the recipe and 
ingredients for a special pizza sauce or the process involved in manufacturing a high efficiency engine. Other entities are not
permitted to steal those secrets and use them for financial gain and laws protect trade secrets as long as the organization does a 
reasonable job keeping them secret.

Release of proprietary information or trade secrets can happen either accidentally or on purpose and damage an organization.
To avoid this problem there are steps that can be taken
 - Do not cross the line between giving the audience the “inside scoop” and divulging a trade secret.
 - Do not release customer lists or profile information.
 - Do not provide financial insights that could violate SEC rules.
 - Do not divulge the results of research data.
 - Do not share information about business deals.
 - Have a release manager review all content before it is posted.
 - Train the entire social media team on legal issues.

In many cases there are no specific regulations governing how social media sites must safeguard their data; however, release 
or abuse of privacy data can lead to bad press and public relations issues. An organisation should have a clear privacy policy 
that is enforced consistently, and all social media team members should be trained on the policy. Some things to consider are
 - Cookies used on websites, apps, etc
 - Data collection practices
 - Third-party data sharing
 - Protection of the data of minors (may differ in each jurisdiction)
 - Mobile data privacy

Defamation is a legal term and is defined as a false, published statement that is injurious to the reputation of a person orbusiness.
There are 2 main types of defamation
  - Libel, or written defamation
  - Slander, or verbal defamation 
As Social Media is written in nature defamatory content would be libel, and there is always the possibility that inappropriate 
content will appear on your social media channels. Steps should be taken to avoid this issue
  - Create a clearly visible proper use policy that clearly states what is acceptable and what is not. 
  - Monitor comments and enforce the policy consistently. 
  - Create a Defamation Response Policy within your larger social media policy.

Course 09 - Launching Successful Campaigns
Native advertising is advertising that is delivered in-stream and is targeted to the user, providing value through 
relevant content. 
Its benefits include
  - Looks the same as the other content on the site and offers something tangible to the consumer—generally related to 
    brand as well as the rest of the content on the site. 
  - Native ads are more likely to be viewed than banner ads, people are up tp 25% more likely to look at a native ad 
    than they are a banner ad.
  - Social media services that offer integrated paid social media advertising include Facebook, Google+, YouTube, 
    Twitter etc

All advertising should always be targeted, but social media is unique in this regard because once you target someone, 
you have the potential to access their friends, family and fans as well. This allows you to
  - Provide opportunities for your content to be promoted to fans and friends of fans
  - Work to extend your reach into the entire network of connections

One of the most successful methods to utilise this is Social Media Contests 
  - Create contests that require people to perform a simple action.
  - Offer prizes of interest to your target customers.
  - Engage in a way they will see as enjoyable.
  - Follow the rules for contests and sweepstakes on each platform.
  - Consider using social media contest software tools

Document all aspects of each social media marketing campaign, including tasks, time it took to complete each task and 
any lessons learned along the way. Thiis reduces wasted time reinventing processes, increases efficiency, makes it 
easier to repeat tasks,encourages consistency in approach and quality and helps in training new team members. 
Examples include
  - Action Plans -- This is a written document that clearly details the following
    - Steps that need to occur 
    - Amount of time needed to complete the steps 
    - Resources needed to carry out the steps 
    - Person responsible for carrying out the actions for the steps 
    - Date by which the steps must be completed
  - Editorial Calendar -- This is used to plan, execute, and maintain consistency and quality in your content and delivery.
    - Detail the content delivery platform, when content will be delivered, and the topic of the content
    - Better than ad-hoc posting, release content consistently
    - Plan your calendar content well ahead of the publication time
  - Project Management Software -- Example Microsoft Project, allows you to track multiple projects and track the following 
    details
    - Tasks, estimated task durations and milestones
    - Resources (people, supplies, equipment, etc.)
    - Task assignments
    - Costs
    - Timelines and deadlines
    - Project management software offers powerful reports.
Dozens of vendors offer performance dashboard tools, some examples include SumAll, Geckoboard and Socialbakers each of 
these will have broadly the same range of tools. As with Social Media Management tools the key is to put together a 
list of features that you need and then select the most suitable.

  - Let your customer know that you’re listening by acknowledging the feedback 
  - Consider offering the person a perk the next time they come use your service or purchase your product.

forms, and it is considered non-specificif it isn’t from a customer or someone who has directly experienced your brand.

    - Is it from a respected source, or is it anonymous feedback?
  - Review against acceptable use policy.
  - Respond (or do not respond) based on social media policy.

Course 12 - Measuring, Analyzing and Reporting 
Social Media Analytics
Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics 
  - Analytics tools capture user activity on social media platforms, providing a wealth of statistics that can be analyzed to 
    measure success or failure rates on things like campaigns etc.
  - The goal is to track specific, concrete actions visitors perform that can be measured to indicate that the social media
    campaign is performing successfully.
  - The result is to identify if your website and social media campaigns are successful.

Social Media is not that old and as a result its impact on the organisation particularly financial can be difficult to measure.
This is because of several factors

  - What to measure may vary by position or department 
    - Sales may want to measure lead generation 
    - Customer service may want to measure resolved complaints 
    - Social media team may want to measure number of fans or likes

You should perform social media audits on a regular basis in order to collect metric data.
  - Compare metrics with previous performance and chart progress
  - Compare metrics with competitors in your industry
  - Set a baseline for future measurement

There are a few different metrics that you can use to track your organisation

toward it.
  - There are some metrics which can be used to measure Brand Health
    - Conversation share (brand mentions / (total mentions of brand + competitors) 
    - Amplification rate (how many people share your content) 
    - Applause rate (how many people like your content)
  - Use sentiment analysis to identify attitudes towards your brand

    - Individual Social Media platforms
    - Across multiple platforms
    - Individual products or brand-related terms.

    - Number of total leads (people who might take the action you want, such as buying, downloading or registering)
    - Number of leads who took the desired action (actual conversions)
 
Calculating economic value will show the total investment and return on investment (ROI) for your organization.
  -  To calculate economic value
    - Use analytics data to find revenues generated from social media.

you are tracking.
  - Compare the results to previous results
  - Track the progression in your social media metrics over time
  - Look for correlations between those metrics and your performance related to conversions and meeting your defined social
    media goals

Reports of social media performance (whether good or bad) are critical for evaluating the next round of social media activity.
  - Use to update key stakeholders, report ROI, and evaluate other details that will impact planning and execution

Course 13 - The Social Media Strategist Career
Salary will vary according to locations, some other factors that will influence it are
  - Supply and demand for social media services in your area
  - Your professional credentials and level of skill and quality
  - Relationships you have with other professionals
 
Working as an independent contractor can be another option, pricing work can be difficult and often different people will have 
different pricing, one standard method is
  - Hours * Rate) + Expense = Cost
Ensure that you thoroughly track and estimate all hours related to social media activities
Research your competition and what they charge

You can also place bids on projects which are typically on an hourly basis or a flat-rate basis.
Hourly bids are safer because you agree to work a set number of hours at a set hourly rate.
With a fixed rate bid you agree to perform a project to completion for a flat fee. This means that
  - Must have strong knowledge to properly estimate the time 
  - Limit your risk by being very specific about the hours spent on tasks 
  - Clearly state expectations, deliverables, and what you will and will not do as part of the contract
You should always create an action plan ahead of creating estimates to get a clearer idea of the tasks and hours involved and 
then create estimates from those action plans.

Social media initiatives are often part of larger and broader advertising or online initiatives, and it is impossible for one 
person to be an be an expert in everything which means that you will need to 
  - Build strong partnerships with trusted resources
  - Use partners that you know and trust to be responsive, do a good job, and make the client happy
  - Develop a referral network to work with partners you know
  - Create easy ways for you and your partners to refer opportunities to one another, such as LinkedIn or a job board
  - Ask for examples of a partner’s work as well as client references

An RFP is a Request For Proposal which is a document that you will build when you have a project and need some partners. 
There are several factors that need consideration including
  - Vendor qualities and qualifications 
  - Services, strategy, and reputation 
  - Content, community, and influencer outreach 
  - Client services and project management 
  - Evaluation tools, metrics, and channels

The key difference between a social media strategist and a successful social media strategist boils down to one word: results.
Some key things to remember are 
  - Stay on the cutting edge (update your skills)
  - Listen more than you talk (pay attention)
  - Abandon the failures quickly (be willing to shift gears)
  - Do nothing that you wouldn’t want to follow you forever (be cautious)
