<h1><p align=center>Section 2: Incident Response In Cyber Security</h1><br/>

What is Incident Response and why do I need it?
  -
  - Incident Response can be thought of as like a fire drill but in this case for IT people
  - When the worst case scenario becomes a reality it is essential to have the right plan in place
  - There are 6 main phases of an incident response plan
    - Preperation
      - Preparing user for potential incidents in case they occur 
    - Identification
      - Figuring what is meant by security incident
      - Which events can be ignored versus which must be acted on right away
    - Containment
      - Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage
    - Eradication
      - Finding and eliminating root cause(s) of an incident 
    - Recovery
      - Permitting affected systems back into production 
    - Lessons Learned
      - Writing down what occurred and analysing with all team members to improve
  - The main issue with plans is that they are meant to sit on the shelf until an incident occurs
  - The course encourages a more proactive approach due to the benfits it has versus the traditional methods
    - Security is a subset of reliability and everyone wants the most reliable system possible 
  - There are 3 key things to keep in mind
    - Define what would be incident response success, there are many different successes in defensive work
      - The common wisdom is that the attacker only has to be correct once whereas the defender must be correct always
      - This is not always true as attacks may not be all or nothing
      - They can happen over time with many stages before being successful
    - Do not panic and stay focused
      - 
    - Start with simple steps as most attackers are lazy
