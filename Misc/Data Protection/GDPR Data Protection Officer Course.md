Top myths about GDPR
  -
  - Understanding what GDPR is not
  - GDPR is only applicable in the EU
    - This is a very common myth but GDPR is applicable to all organisations that process personal data of EU residents
    - A lot of non-european companies fall into this category 
  - Consent is the only way to process personal data
    - Again a common myth, consent is one of 6 legitimate purposes
    - In many cases it is also last option that should be used for processing personal data
    - This is because the subject can always withdraw their consent
    - If consent is withdrawn then the controller and processor must cease processing the data
  - GDPR is about fines
    - GDPR is about putting the data subject first
    - Non-compliance with GDPR will bring about large fines but these are a last resort
    - It's objective is to make organisations follow transparency and accountability rather than the supervisory authority having to ask for important documents
  - All organisations need a DPO
    - A DPO should be assigned if an organisation is a public authority or engages in large scale data processing of a certain type
    - If an organisation does not meet this criteria then it does not need a DPO

Legitimate purposes of processing personal data
  -
  - GDPR is based on the principle that all processing of personal data needs to be based on a legitimate purpose
  - There are 6 types of purposes that are considered to be legitimate
    - Performance of a contractual agreement
    - Compliance with a legal obligation
    - Fulfillment of a legitimate interest
    - Protection of a vital interest
    - Processing in the public interest
    - Consent of the data subject
