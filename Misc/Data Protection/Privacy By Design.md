<h1><p align=center>Section 1: Introduction </h1><br/>

Introduction - Why Privacy by Design is extremely important
  -
  - Introduction to the instructor and course
  - Privacy By design is something that should be learned first by everybody involved in privacy
    - The only way to do this is to create a culture of privacy 
  - Issues are many times caused by people in the company not criminal
  - The only way to change people's behaviour is to embed privacy from the very beginning
  - Privacy by design which is a software development strategy and is decades old is now being discussed as a foundational strategy for all organisations
    - The original goal of privacy by design was to ensure developers were building privacy from the ground up

Are there any challenges?
  -
  -
     
It is extremely important to include privacy from early stages!
  -
  - Most people feel that their privacy is out of their control and they are helpless to do anything
    - This is despite it being very important to people
    - They are resigned to losing their privacy but it may not be their fault
  - There are both structural and psychological reasons why people are not in a position to protect their own privacy
  - Structural Asymmetry
    - Asymmetry is a result when one party has a distinct advantage over another
    - This can occur in a number of ways and their are 3 different types of asymmetry that affect and individual's privacy interests
