<h1><p align=center>Section 1: Introduction </h1><br/>

Introduction - Why Privacy by Design is extremely important
  -
  - Introduction to the instructor and course
  - Privacy By design is something that should be learned first by everybody involved in privacy
    - The only way to do this is to create a culture of privacy 
  - Issues are many times caused by people in the company not criminal
  - The only way to change people's behaviour is to embed privacy from the very beginning
  - Privacy by design which is a software development strategy and is decades old is now being discussed as a foundational strategy for all organisations
    - The original goal of privacy by design was to ensure developers were building privacy from the ground up

Are there any challenges?
  -
  - Privacy By Design has faced challenges in the past decade
  - Many of these challenges are down to the high level nature of the principles involved
    - This can mean that there is a lack of needed specificity in checklists or action items
  - In 2011 the authors of privacy by design stated that it provided no lead with respect to the principles according to which technology should be applied
  - This definition of privacy by design is therefore susceptible to interpretation
    - In one interpretation that any data can be collected as long as it is with a privacy label 
  - In 2012 Sarah Spiekermann said that privacy is a fuzzy concept
    - This is because there is no agreed upon methodology to engineer privacy into systems 
  - In 2015 Daniel Solove wrote in a blog post about the 4 challenges in privacy by design
    - Design choices are not fixed
    - Most of the design choices that implicate privacy are not value neutral
    - Privacy by design is only as good as the underlying concept of design
    - Privacy by design is difficult 
  - This course will address some of these but will not fix every problem
  - Many developers want simple solutions such as checkboxes
    - In this scenario simply following this list would mean assured privacy
  - Unfortunately in many cases this approach simply will not work
    - There are multiple ways to design systems including designs that are privacy friendly 
     
It is extremely important to include privacy from early stages!
  -
  - Most people feel that their privacy is out of their control and they are helpless to do anything
    - This is despite it being very important to people
    - They are resigned to losing their privacy but it may not be their fault
  - There are both structural and psychological reasons why people are not in a position to protect their own privacy
  - Structural Asymmetry
    - Asymmetry is a result when one party has a distinct advantage over another
    - This can occur in a number of ways and their are 3 different types of asymmetry that affect and individual's privacy interests

<h1><p align=center>Section 3: Let's define a privacy by design Model!</h1><br/>

What is this section about?
  -
  - A brief intro to what the section covers
  
Individuals 
  -
  -
  
Important Actors
  -
  - Any party that interacts with an individual or their information is a potential threat
  - This can be a party that directly or indirectly interacts with an individual
    - It can also be someone who interacts with an individual through processing their data 
  - These interactions usually fall into a few different categories
    - They can be continuous like using a social media application
    - Periodic such as a census in a country which happens every few years
    - Random which can be something like shoulder surfing in a cafe
    - Occasional such as at a restaurant that an individual frequents
    - Fleeting which is something like a CCTV catching a car licence plate driving by 
  - Interactions can occur as a result of events that are scheduled or unscheduled
  - All of the above are domain actors and all respresent a potential threat
  - The term domain actors is used in whatever system is being discussed
    - A domain actor can be something like a database hosting service because they control use, storage etc
  - When talking about they risk they pose to an individual the term threat actor is appropriate

<h1><p align=center>Section 5: Privacy Analysis - The FAIR method for privacy risk </h1><br/>

Risk Analysis from Privacy perspective 
  -
  - There have been 3 main deficiencies that efforts at privacy risk analysis has suffered from
    - The first is that they have focused on risks to the organisation such as privacy law compliance risk and the potential cost of fines
      - This has led to a special kind of myopia, because they are focused on legal violations they do not anticipate things like social backlash
      - This is especially true when new technologies sidestep regulation rules
    - The next deficiency is a terminology problem
      - An absence of controls is usually labelled as a risk which is a mislabelling
      - The controls exist as a preventative measure against the actual underlying risk
      - This is not only something that happens in privacy risk assessment but also in IT security too
      - Unencrypted data is one example of a commonly mislabelled risk, encryption is a control, lacking it is not a risk
      - The risk in this case is that someone without permission will access the data and use it in a way that violates privacy
    - Most risk analysis methodologies are qualitative in nature
      - Risks are framed in terms of likeliness of occurrence (high, low or medium)
      - People often use qualitative analysis to provide cover for inaccuracies in judgement
      - This cover though often causes miscommunication and bad decision making
      - The major deficiency here is that without more it can be difficult to determine which controls are cost effective
  - This section covers a modified Factor Analysis of Information Risk to quantify privacy risk
    - It focuses on risks to individuals rather than organisations
    - The entire FAIR approach will not be covered but how it maps to privacy violations will be
  - Risk Analysis cannot be done in isolation
    - It must be done holistically because there is always potential that outside factors may influence risk to the individual
