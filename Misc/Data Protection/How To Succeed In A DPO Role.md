<h1><p align=center>Section 2: Brief overview of the DPO role</h1><br/>

Mandatory and Voluntary DPO
   -
   - Under article 37, GDPR specifies that a DPO is required to be sppointed by a controller or processor in some situations
     - Data processing is carried out by a public authority or body except for courts which are acting in a judicial fasion
     - The core activities of the controller or processor consist of processing activities of a nature that require systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale
     - The core activities of the controller or processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories
       - This is related to Article 9 and personal data referring to criminal convictions and offenses contained in Article 10
     - Working Party 29 has published its own guidelines to furhter explain the requirements
       - All public authorities will be expected to designate a DPO
       - Wp29 did note that sometimes organisations may carry out public tasks or gain public recognition (notoriety)
         - This will be in areas such as public transportation, housing brroadcating among others
       - These organisations are not required to appoint a DPO
         - Where possible though they are encouraged to do so 
       - Often individuals (subjects) have little choice over how these organisations process their data
