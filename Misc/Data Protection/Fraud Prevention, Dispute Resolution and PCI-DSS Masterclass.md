Fraud Fundamentals
  -
  - Payment fraud is a global problem and is one that is expected to get worse
    - Losses tripled between 2011 and 2020, it is expected to grow a further 25% 
  - There are multiple stakeholders at risk from fraud
    - Online merchants, bank and customers
  - The risks of fraud that banks face are different from others
    - There are usually 3 main risks that banks face
    - Attrition risk which is the risk of losing clients or customers especially to competitors
    - Credit risk such as when clients do not pay bills
    - Fraud risk such as a customer account be defrauded
    - Attrition and credit risk can be managed but fraud risk requires close monitoring 
  - There are differences between fraud and disputes which need clarification
    - Fraud is actually a type of dispute between a merchant and a customer
    - There are 4 main types of problems that disputes originate from
      - Fraud where a customer was impersonated or their stolen information was used
        - Identity theft is one of the most pervasive forms of fraud and is tough to detect 
      - Authorization where the consumer did not allow the merchant to proceed
      - Processing error where the merchant has provided wrong or incomplete information
        - Some fraud cases are handled manuall, some automatically, a credit card with a blacklisted number will have trandactions automatically rejected 
      - Consumer disputes where a product is either faulty or fake or undelivered etc
      - A dispute normally occurs when a customer requests a chargeback of a transaction value
        - There is normally a reason code and it is provided by the card issuer, it will show the dispute type
        - A chargeback is a request for money to be returned to a customer

Module Intro
  -
  - Brief intro to what the module will cover
  
General Strategies: Intro
  -
  - Perpetrators of fraud usually employ one of a few major strategies to collect information and use it
    - In spite of specific contexts such as consumer fraud or card block farud the methods used to gain information mostly are similar and fall into a few groups
    - Convenience which uses readily available information
    - Social Engineering which manipulates people for information
    - Internal fraud where internal people leak sensitive information
    - Identity Theft where a person is impersonated

General Strategies: Convenience
  -
  - Convenience fraud is relatively simple
    - It uses readily available information that can be repurposed for fraud
    - It frequently occurs in situations where a fraudster has a lot of different information on many people
    - This allows for the easy testing of the details of multiple cards or people
    - There is a technique called skimming which copies the credit card that someone uses
      - https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/how-to-spot-a-credit-card-skimmer/
      - https://www.fraudsmart.ie/personal/fraud-scams/card-cheque-fraud/counterfeit-skimming/ 
    - A fraudster can impersonate a retail worker getting credit card information
      - The same works for an actual retail worker who commits fraud 
    - They can plant a device on card readers to gather card information
      - This device is called a skimmer 
  - The convenience approach to fraud allows a fraudster to easily test different types of cards
    - The low hanging fruit in this situation are the transactions that are blocked
    - A fraudster is then able to go deeper on to banks that are less protected against fraud
  - Examples Of Convenience Strategies
    - A couple of examples are already covered, ATM skimmers and retail workers
    - A newer example is called a shimmer
      - A lot of skimmers stopped working once magnetic strips stopped being used on cards
      - Chip cards became more important and shimmers are the equivalent for these
        - https://chargebacks911.com/credit-card-shimmers/   

General Strategies: Social Engineering
  -
  - Social Engineering is the practice of manipulating someone into revealing information that is confidential
    - This is usually done by someone pretending to be someone that they are not 
  - There are 2 major approaches to social engineering
    - Via phone and impersonating an employee eg getting a password from someone by pretending to be tech support
    - Phishing using anything from emails, SMS texts even websites to make users think that they are in a trusted environment 
  - Social engineering in most cases is reliant on using existing information known to the fraudster so that they appear legitimate
    - This makes the target assume that the fraudster is who they claim to be so that they reveal information
    - Someone for instance impersonating a company employee can use OSINT on the person
      - https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-open-source-intelligence/ 
    - This allows the fraudster to contact a target and convince them to share something such as a password 
  - There are different examples available
    - Banking communication where an email or SMS is sent pretending to be a financial institution
      - This is phishing and is aimed at tricking people into giving away password details 
    - Social Networks have a variation of phishing called Social Network Phishing
      - Emails pretending to be from Facebook 
    - Calls from the security team, this is the most frequent type of social engineering
      - Some pretends to be from the security team and has a very convincing reason to share sensitive information  
  
General Strategies: Internal Fraud
  -
  - Internal Fraud consists of using proprietarty information that you have access to in order to commit fraud
  - This can include a couple of ways
    - If a person works for a fraud detection service and provides information to allow others to bypass the detection mechanisms
    - If working in customer support of a retailer and using knowledge of automatically approved charges to allow for purchasing products fraudulently 
  - It can be one of the most difficult methods to detect as the person involved knows how to avoid detection
  - There are 2 major types of Internal Fraud
    - First-party fraud
      - This is where the consumer themselves perform fraud eg exploiting return policies to use and return items with no intention of buying
    - Third-party fraud
      - This is where a person with internal knowledge of a company sells information obtaining a fee of some kind
      - This type of fraud is usually done at scale with multiple small value transactions
  - Some example include
    - Fenceable items, corporate fraud and insurance fraud

Module Intro
  -
  - Brief intro to what the module will cover
  - 
  
Data Verification: Intro
  -
  - There are transaction elements other than verifying a person's identity the can be verified
  - One example is to use velocity checks
    - These are used to identify the probability of fraud in a transaction
    - This is where how frequently information is used or changed can be verified
  - Transaction information such as credit card details are another thing that can be verified    

Data Verification: Velocity Checks
  -
  - As the name says Velocity Checks are about verifying the speed at which specific information is changed or used
  - There are 2 different checks that can be used
    - Velocity of use checks
      - This is a metric that captures the amount of times a certain information field has been used
      - One example is the number of times a credit card number has been used
      - It can be used to detect fake shipping addresses used for multiple purposes
      - Bust-out fraud where a card is used for multiple purchases in a short time is a real life use
        - https://www.chargebackgurus.com/blog/bust-out-fraud 
    - Velocity of change checks
      - This metric captures the amount of times that a inforrmation field has been changed within a certain timeframe
      - One example is the change of an address associated with a certain card number
      - It is regularly used to detect fraud at scale such as using the same cards with different names or addresses
