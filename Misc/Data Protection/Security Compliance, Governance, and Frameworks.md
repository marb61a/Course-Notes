What Security Compliance Aims to Achieve		
  -
  - Most if not all organisations have a set of standards or rules to work against
  - Compliance is about comparing current work practices against those rules
  - In some organisations this is quite formal as there are written policies in place
  	- Everyone should be aware of and working in accordance with these policies 
  - These policies are typically formulated by senior management or policy committees
  - In addition there can be requirements for things like projects
  - There may also be regulations set out by regulatory bodies which need to be adhered to
  	- There is an increase in regulation for security compliance 
  - The top reason for compliance is the law
  	- All jurisdictions will have laws around how various organisations can and cannot operate 
  - What Security Compliance Aims to Achieve
  	- It will usually set out a minimum standard for security whether it is in rules, policies etc
    - The purpose is to ensure that all users adhere to standards
    - It will allow non-compliance to be easily identified
    - The overriding purpose of the above is the protection of both individuals as well as organisations
    - The main goal is that the CIA triad of data is achieved
 
Who Determines You Need to Comply		
  -
  - There is a cost to compliance so it is important to know who determines why it is necessary
  	- It is important to invest in compliance as non-compliance can be very expensive 
  - There are 2 different types of compliance
	  - Mandatory
    	- This will be things that refer to specific laws such as GDPR, HIPPA etc
      - Compliance with these is mandatory for an organisation that meets certain criteria
	  - Voluntary
    	- This will include things such as ISO27001 compliance
