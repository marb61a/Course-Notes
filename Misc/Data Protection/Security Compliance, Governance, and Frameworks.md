What Security Compliance Aims to Achieve		
  -
  - Most if not all organisations have a set of standards or rules to work against
  - Compliance is about comparing current work practices against those rules
  - In some organisations this is quite formal as there are written policies in place
  	- Everyone should be aware of and working in accordance with these policies 
  - These policies are typically formulated by senior management or policy committees
  - In addition there can be requirements for things like projects
  - There may also be regulations set out by regulatory bodies which need to be adhered to
  	- There is an increase in regulation for security compliance 
  - The top reason for compliance is the law
  	- All jurisdictions will have laws around how various organisations can and cannot operate 
  - What Security Compliance Aims to Achieve
  	- It will usually set out a minimum standard for security whether it is in rules, policies etc
    - The purpose is to ensure that all users adhere to standards
    - It will allow non-compliance to be easily identified
    - The overriding purpose of the above is the protection of both individuals as well as organisations
    - The main goal is that the CIA triad of data is achieved
 
Who Determines You Need to Comply		
  -
  - There is a cost to compliance so it is important to know who determines why it is necessary
  	- It is important to invest in compliance as non-compliance can be very expensive 
  - There are 2 different types of compliance
	  - Mandatory
    	- This will be things that refer to specific laws such as GDPR, HIPPA etc
      - Compliance with these is mandatory for an organisation that meets certain criteria
	  - Voluntary
    	- This will include things such as ISO27001 compliance
      - Cyber Essentials
      	- This is a UK centered slimmed down version of the ISO27001 standard
        - Although voluntary some government departments will not give contracts to people without this certification 
 
Why You Need to Comply		
  -
  - There are 3 main reasons why you should comply with Security compliance requirements
  	- It is the law, this means there is no choice but to comply with requirements
    - The second is a commercial decision as some markets will force you to comply
    - To improve standards and voluntarily comply which is another large driver of compliance 
  - Disadvantages of Non-compliance
  	- There are financial penalties which can be applied to an organisation for non-compliance with requirements
   		- One example is the significant fines imposed on organisations who are not GDPR compliant 
    - Regulators in certain areas may impose restrictions
    	- This is more common in areas such as health or finance
      - Offenders may be fined or face restrictions on the services that they can offer  
    - Association sanctions occur when there is not a formal regulator in place
    	- Instead there is a working group who put in place rules to be complied with
      - Card schemes for payment cards is a good example eg non compliance with PCI-DSS may cause higher fees
    - Legal consequences
    	- There have been many cases where people pursue lawsuits against organisations who have not complied with Security requirements  
 
Cost of Compliance
  -
  - Compliance does not come free and is an increasing cost for organisations
  - There are a few different costs associated with compliance
  	- Direct fees such as registration fees, certification fees, audit fees (both internal and external) and control implementation cost
