  - Brief intro to what the module will cover

4 Key Principles
  -
  - There are 4 key principles of relevance
  - Data as assets which measures data in the same way as other 'hard' assets
    - In order for a data management (DM) or Data Governance (DG) initiative to succeed it must be seen like other assets such as inventory etc
    - The same rigorous processes and standards must be used to measure data that are used elsewhere in a company
    - This in turn changes data into something tangible and which can be measured, tracked etc
    - One of the key successes will be to get stakeholders sharing this line of thinking
  - Data monetisation which allows for data having financial benefits if handled correctly
    - This principle stems from the first one
    - The benefits of managing data well are usually the opposite of the costs of not managing data well
    - There are 3 main costs of this type
      - Increased revenue eg creating better performing products with better data
      - Operational costs can be decreased by eliminating unecessary task or reducing waste etc
      - Avoiding fines due to non-compliance with regulatory requirements 
    - Data will generate money if it is well handled 
  - Information maturity which measures how sophisticated an organisation is
    - Any organisation seeking to start a DG or DM activity should know where they are in terms of data
    - There are several different activities that would be covered by the term Information Maturity
      - How data literate senior management and other stakeholders are
      - How sophisticated are the policies for retaining data especially  sensitive PII data
      - How much data is there about the data (metadata)  
    - This is not a direct representation of how effective data is managed but instead is a powerful indicator
  - Data Governance is everybody's responsibility and not an IT job
