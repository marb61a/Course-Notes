<h1><p align=center>Section 2: Understanding the need for privacy in IT environment</h1><br/>

Evolving compliance requirements
   -
   - Regulatory activities, security threats, advances in technologies, new software releases and increasing proliferation in social networks can seriously impact approaches to compliance
   - IT Professionals must be able to respond to the needs of their organisation
     - They must be able to predict the effect that events might have on the product, security and privacy readiness for their organisation
   - Privacy controls have become an integral part of a proper IT compliance program
   - Good internal privacy procedures can help attract and keep good employees
   - Prospective employees will be reluctant to work in companies that have poor reputations for privacy
     - This is because working in such a company will have a bad effect on their career
     - They are also likely to be concerned that their own personal data could be released to the wrong person cauing issues for them
   - Having good external privacy procedures can also help attract and retain customers as well as business partners and investors
     - Doing business with a company with a bad reputation can be seen as a risk
     - Having a relationship with this company could have an even worse impact 
   - NCASE Rules
     - These rules were setup by the FTC
     - This is an acronym standing for Notice Choice Access Security Enforcement
     - https://iapp.org/news/a/what-ftc-enforcement-actions-teach-us-about-the-makings-of-reasonable-privacy-and-data-security-practices-a-follow-up-study/
     - When these rules were put in place the IT challenges did not have to face things like social networks
     - Challenges were minimising spam or ensuring backups were done
     - Notice means that consumers should be given notice of an organisations information practices before any personal information is collected
     - A consumer cannot make informed decisions as to whether and to what extent to disclose personal information
     - Choice is giving consumers options as how any personal information is collected and used
       - It refers to the secondary use of information that is necessary to complete transactions 
     - Access refers to the ability of an individual to access data about themselves and then contest its accuracy and completeness
       - Both of these are needed to ensure that data is accurate and complete
     - Security which covers both managerial and technical security measures
       - These are needed to protect against loss and the unauthorised and destruction used for disclosure of data
       - Technical security measures to prevent unauthorised access include encryption in the transmission or storage of data
         - They also include limits on access to use the credentials, implementation of role based access control and other techniques too
         - The storage of data on secure servers or clients is also important
     - Privacy principles can only be effective if there is a mechanism to enforce them
   
Major Risks to a Company's IT Framework
  -
  - An example of using an IT manager to demonstrate the IT risks that an organisation faces
    - This organisation would have hundreds of servers, network appliances, applications etc
    - Not alone does the organisation have to have it's systems running smoothly
    - There are also regulatory requirements, industry regulations and corporate policies that have to be met
    - Each type of system has it own requirements that have to be met
    - Any failure to address these could cause issues such as data breaches, improper use of personal data
    - IT risks include improper access controls or application of data retention policies
      - This can mean the wrong people being able to access important organisational documents 
    - Failure to meet commitments could lead to accreditation loss which may mean cutomers going elsewhere
  - The Client Side
    - This typically represents the computers that are used by company employees
    - They are usually connected to the company server side systems
    - This side can represent a significant threat to the company system as well as sensitive data
    - Employees often download customer files etc to their own computer for processing
    - Some employees even store personal information on company computers
    - These employee computers may have access to documents such as business plans which could be of interest to competitors
    - Even when an employee's computer is protected from known threats there is still more to do to address privacy issues
    - When accessing company systems employees should be made aware of their privacy obligations
    - There should be privacy training prior to being allowed to access any personal data
    - When data is accessed for the first time there should be a reminder of privacy policies for the data
  - The Server Side
    - Organisational computers such as servers share the same vulnerabilities as their client counterparts
    - These risks can be mitigated somewhat as many client applications do not need to be on a server
    - Most users do not need to access servers directly
    - Reducing the number or applications on a server reduces the vulnerable attack surface
    - When possible all data on a server should be classified based on origin, category, sensitivity and purpose
    - One example is where data that is used for research should have no personally identifiable information
    - Any linkage that exists between different datasets must not break any organisational rules
  - Security Policy & Personnel
    - Privacy cannot be assured unless practical measures have been established
    - Any security policy with no accountability or enforcement has little value
    - Each organisation should have both a policy and personnel to enforce it
    - A privacy impact assessment (PIA) can help fin gaps in security policy coverage and determine what is required to close them

Application Related Risks
  -
  - Most organisation emploees rely on software applications to get their jobs done
  - There should be a limit on the number and type of applications on a company computer
  - The more applications that are on a users computer the more opportunities there are for security problems
  - Office productivity software is probably the most commonly used type of software
    - Even these applications can harbour malware such as viruses, key loggers and others 
  - There is a large market for vulnerabilities which means that for some hacking is a full time job
  - Some applications do collect data as part of their terms and conditions which needs to be understood prior to being used in a company
  - There are some steps that need to be taken to avoid applications that invade privacy
    - Privileged access places restrictions on who can install or configure software on a user's computer
      - A software administrator can ensure that employees do not need to know the various software or installation policies 
    - Software Policy
      - Each organisation should have a policy that tells the requirements and guidelines for applications used on organisation computers
    - Privacy Links
      - Each application where possible should have a link to a privacy policy that explains the privacy obligations to data accessed via the application 
    - Application Research
      - Organisations should perform research to find application that are the most appropriate for their systems and employees
      - There should also be a full documenting of application vesions, settings, configuration and installation information
      - IT personnel should monitor security bulletins for information that will help identify application vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
    - Employee Training
      - All employees should be trained on the organisation's software policy
      - This should also include threats to privacy from indvertant installation of malicious software
      - The same goes for incorrect configuration of legitimately installed applications
      - Properly trained employees will protect sensitive information better then the best systems will
      - Yearly privacy training is something that most organisations should consider
    - IT Involvement
      - The IT department is an integral part of any application management strategy
      - They should be trained to understand privacy threats and work with the privacy team to manage application deployment
      - IT department personnel will server as advisors to employees and so should be trained on a variety of productivity applications
      - This will allow them to show employees the most appropriate application to complete a specific task
      - Depending on the strategy of the organisation there can be different application deployment strategies
        - IT Controlled which is where the department enforces a policy that only itself can set up each computer ensureing only certain applications are installed
          - The IT department can ensure that all applications have proper versions, patches and upgrades 
        - IT Monitored which is where all organisation computers are periodically scanned to validate installed applications
          - This means that each application should be the right version and configuration set 
        - Employee Controlled
          - This is where organisations let employees manage their own computer systems based on organisation policy
          - If this is the approach chosen then each employee should be given training on software policy
          - They should also be encouraged to use anti-malware software
          - This is the riskiest strategy and should be avoided as harm from malicious applications may not be contained to a single computer

Network Related Risks
  -
  - The organisation network is one of the most challenging to protect
  - This is because of its pervasiveness in the number of possible connects both temporary and permanent
  - The network is connected to an array of equipment such as client computers, revers, routers, hubs, switches, packet filters etc
  - Traffic over the network can also come from an array of sources such as customers, vendors connected via wireless, VPN or other connections
  - Many applications running on the various types of electronic equipment such as smartphones can also access the network

<h1><p align=center>Section 4: Privacy Considerations & Techniques </h1><br/>

The Collection Process - Notice 
  -
  - For the most part in this context collection occurs via an organisations web server
    - It can also occur via download from a third party site or media shipped 
  - Proper collection practices can minimise privacy risks
    - By ensuring that only the necessary data is collected and only the appropriate people see it 
  - When collecting from users they should be provided with notice, choice, control, consent as needed
  - There should be limits on the data collected
    - It should also be secured from any inappropriate access

Retention - Security Considerations
  -
  -
     
Destruction 
  -
  - At the end of it's lifecycle data should be destroyed
  - Destruction can be designated by a retention period applied to a couple of different factors
    - This can be a record's creation date, a request from a user or the completion of a transaction 
  - Destruction can mean different things at different times
    - Deletion of files, clearing of database records or removal of data
  - A destruction plan should be used in conjunction with an organisation's record management plan
    - This will help ensure the proper removal of data
  - Simply stating that data should be destroyed is not always sufficient
  - There should be clear guidelines on how data should be destroyed based on it's type
  - To help when destroying expired files a custom attribut can be added
    - This could be something like a retention period added to the properties dialog of the files 
  - Once the custom attribute has been added it is easier to retrieve the file to determine when it needs to be destroyed
  - Another possibility is to create a program that runs periodically on a schedule
    - This will read the retention period value from the file and deletes it when the retention period is over
  - One of the standard attributes on the properties dialog details tab can be used to flag files
    - These will be ones that need special operations on them 
  - The destruction of digital content is usually a matter of simlply deleting files containing data or data itself 
  - A large amount of care needs to be taken when deleting data from an entire disk or similar and hadning it off to a third party
    - Standard OS commands usually only delete the header of files when trying to delete files using the command line
    - The files themselves are left intact on the drive

<h1><p align=center>Section 9: Direct Marketing Challenges</h1><br/>

Data Protection & Direct Marketing 
  -
  - Understanding data protection in the context of direct marketing is one of the most challenging and complex areas of data protection laws
  - The main reason for this is that direct marketing not only triggers data protection requirements
    - It also triggers many types of consumre protection regulations in different countries 
  - In addition direct marketing involves using data collected through the device of an addressee which includes
    - Data collected through the smartphone of a user
    - Data that has been collected through the use of cookies on a user's device 
  - Direct marketing messages are no longer limited to post or email
    - They can also be sent via 3rd platform messages, push messages and in-app advertising
  - This can lead to a situation where data controllers are struggling with the array of opt-in and opt-out consent requirements
    - These are applied across the spectrum of marketing communication channels 
  - Failure to have a complete understanding of how data protection applies to direct marketing can have consequences
    - This will be to both individuals and businesses  
  - Businesses that do not collect appropriate consents may end up send unwanted communications
    - This can cause legal compliance issues as well as potential brand damage 
  - On the flip side of this is that the business that has overly strict application of data protection rules may cause different issues
    - This will hinder it's ability to send legitimate marketing communications 
  - In addition to data protection concerns data controllers need to be aware of other national laws and regulations
    - Different countries may have codes and laws of their own to apply to direct marketing communcations
    - These typically revolve around the advertising content of marketing communications
    - One example is the Truth in Advertising Laws
      - https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/shopping/misleading-advertising/
      - https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/advertising-and-promotions/advertising/
  - In addition there may be other regulatory requirements for direct marketers
    - This will govern how and when an indiviual's personal data may used and may be stricter that direct marketing laws
    - One example is the regulations used on unsolicited commercial messages
    - The same applies to web pages, emails and app push notifications
  - It is important that data controllers remember to meet all national laws on direct marketing
    - These countries can be either where the sender or recipients lives or even both 
   
The concept of Direct marketing
  -
  - Not all communications from a business are considered as direct marketing
  - Working Part 29 has provided guidance on what the scope is for the term direct marketing
    - It considers it to include any form of sales promotion no matter the source
    - This will include direct marketing by political parties as well as charities
    - The direct marketing message does not need to offer something for sale
    - It can be a free offer or just promoting an organisation in some way
  - Marketing can have a very broad definition
    - In order to fall under the scope of direct marketing the communcation should be directed to particular individuals
    - This means that data protection laws apply to the sending of marketing messages only where individual's personal data is processed
    - This is done so that the marketing message can be communicated to them
  - There are some marketing messages that are not considered as direct marketing
    - Any marketing communications that are not directed at individuals
      - Examples include website banner advertisements, mails sent to companies without contacts being mentioned
      - These are not subject to data protection compliance
    - Messages that are purely service related

<h1><p align=center>Section 11: GDPR for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)</h1><br/>

Cloud and GDPR Concerns
  -
  - GDP is about consent and other lawful processing of data
    - It is also about putting back control of data back in the hands of people 
  - It requires that a risk pespective approach be used
    - This is the risk from the data subjects viewpoint not the company's risk
    - This is from a strategic methodology and technology will be involved
  - Technology is part of both the problem as well as the solution
  - AI can help bring GDPR compliance closer
    - AI can help with metadata as well as retention schemes through automatic classification
    - There is a growing role for AI within the GDPR compliance picture
  - Many technologies stand on both sides of the fence as both risks and enablers
  - Other new technologies such as bockchains have be cited as helping to achieve GDPR compliance
  - There are also newer technologies that cause GDPR problems within organisations
    - This section of the course looks at the cloud 
  - Cloud Computing has been adopted to such a high level that it is the logical place to start
    - It still provides that foundation for many digital transformation initiatives
    - Many parts of the cloud platforms such as file sharing have caused GDPR concerns
    - This is to be expected as the cloud is about data and information outside of premises
