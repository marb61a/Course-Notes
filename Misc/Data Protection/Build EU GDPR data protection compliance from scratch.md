<h1><p align=center>Section 2: Understanding the need for privacy in IT environment</h1><br/>

Evolving compliance requirements
   -
   - Regulatory activities, security threats, advances in technologies, new software releases and increasing proliferation in social networks can seriously impact approaches to compliance
   - IT Professionals must be able to respond to the needs of their organisation
     - They must be able to predict the effect that events might have on the product, security and privacy readiness for their organisation
   - Privacy controls have become an integral part of a proper IT compliance program
   - Good internal privacy procedures can help attract and keep good employees
   - Prospective employees will be reluctant to work in companies that have poor reputations for privacy
     - This is because working in such a company will have a bad effect on their career
     - They are also likely to be concerned that their own personal data could be released to the wrong person cauing issues for them
   - Having good external privacy procedures can also help attract and retain customers as well as business partners and investors
     - Doing business with a company with a bad reputation can be seen as a risk
     - Having a relationship with this company could have an even worse impact 
   - NCASE Rules
     - These rules were setup by the FTC
     - This is an acronym standing for Notice Choice Access Security Enforcement
     - https://iapp.org/news/a/what-ftc-enforcement-actions-teach-us-about-the-makings-of-reasonable-privacy-and-data-security-practices-a-follow-up-study/
     - When these rules were put in place the IT challenges did not have to face things like social networks
     - Challenges were minimising spam or ensuring backups were done
     - Notice means that consumers should be given notice of an organisations information practices before any personal information is collected
     - A consumer cannot make informed decisions as to whether and to what extent to disclose personal information
     - Choice is giving consumers options as how any personal information is collected and used
       - It refers to the secondary use of information that is necessary to complete transactions 
     - Access refers to the ability of an individual to access data about themselves and then contest its accuracy and completeness
       - Both of these are needed to ensure that data is accurate and complete
     - Security which covers both managerial and technical security measures
       - These are needed to protect against loss and the unauthorised and destruction used for disclosure of data
       - Technical security measures to prevent unauthorised access include encryption in the transmission or storage of data
         - They also include limits on access to use the credentials, implementation of role based access control and other techniques too
         - The storage of data on secure servers or clients is also important
     - Privacy principles can only be effective if there is a mechanism to enforce them
   
Major Risks to a Company's IT Framework
  -
  - An example of using an IT manager to demonstrate the IT risks that an organisation faces
    - This organisation would have hundreds of servers, network appliances, applications etc
    - Not alone does the organisation have to have it's systems running smoothly
    - There are also regulatory requirements, industry regulations and corporate policies that have to be met
    - Each type of system has it own requirements that have to be met
    - Any failure to address these could cause issues such as data breaches, improper use of personal data
    - IT risks include improper access controls or application of data retention policies
      - This can mean the wrong people being able to access important organisational documents 
    - Failure to meet commitments could lead to accreditation loss which may mean cutomers going elsewhere
  - The Client Side
    - This typically represents the computers that are used by company employees
    - They are usually connected to the company server side systems
    - This side can represent a significant threat to the company system as well as sensitive data
    - Employees often download customer files etc to their own computer for processing
    - Some employees even store personal information on company computers
    - These employee computers may have access to documents such as business plans which could be of interest to competitors
    - Even when an employee's computer is protected from known threats there is still more to do to address privacy issues
    - When accessing company systems employees should be made aware of their privacy obligations
    - There should be privacy training prior to being allowed to access any personal data
    - When data is accessed for the first time there should be a reminder of privacy policies for the data
  - The Server Side
    - Organisational computers such as servers share the same vulnerabilities as their client counterparts
    - These risks can be mitigated somewhat as many client applications do not need to be on a server
    - Most users do not need to access servers directly
    - Reducing the number or applications on a server reduces the vulnerable attack surface
    - When possible all data on a server should be classified based on origin, category, sensitivity and purpose
    - One example is where data that is used for research should have no personally identifiable information
    - Any linkage that exists between different datasets must not break any organisational rules
  - Security Policy & Personnel
    - Privacy cannot be assured unless practical measures have been established
    - Any security policy with no accountability or enforcement has little value
    - Each organisation should have both a policy and personnel to enforce it
    - A privacy impact assessment (PIA) can help fin gaps in security policy coverage and determine what is required to close them

Application Related Risks
  -
  - Most organisation emploees rely on software applications to get their jobs done
  - There should be a limit on the number and type of applications on a company computer
  - The more applications that are on a users computer the more opportunities there are for security problems
  - Office productivity software is probably the most commonly used type of software
    - Even these applications can harbour malware such as viruses, key loggers and others

Retention - Security Considerations
  -
  -
     
Destruction 
  -
  - At the end of it's lifecycle data should be destroyed
  - Destruction can be designated by a retention period applied to a couple of different factors
    - This can be a record's creation date, a request from a user or the completion of a transaction 
  - Destruction can mean different things at different times
    - Deletion of files, clearing of database records or removal of data
  - A destruction plan should be used in conjunction with an organisation's record management plan
    - This will help ensure the proper removal of data
  - Simply stating that data should be destroyed is not always sufficient
  - There should be clear guidelines on how data should be destroyed based on it's type
  - To help when destroying expired files a custom attribut can be added
    - This could be something like a retention period added to the properties dialog of the files 
  - Once the custom attribute has been added it is easier to retrieve the file to determine when it needs to be destroyed
  - Another possibility is to create a program that runs periodically on a schedule
    - This will read the retention period value from the file and deletes it when the retention period is over
  - One of the standard attributes on the properties dialog details tab can be used to flag files
    - These will be ones that need special operations on them 
  - The destruction of digital content is usually a matter of simlply deleting files containing data or data itself 
  - A large amount of care needs to be taken when deleting data from an entire disk or similar and hadning it off to a third party
    - Standard OS commands usually only delete the header of files when trying to delete files using the command line
    - The files themselves are left intact on the drive
