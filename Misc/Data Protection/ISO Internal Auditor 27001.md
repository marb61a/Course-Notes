What is ISO 27001?
  -
  - ISO27001 is an internationally recognised standard
  - It contains the requirements for establishing, implementing and maintaining an Iformation Security Management System (ISMS)
  - ISO27001 consists of 2 parts
    - The requirements clauses and Annex A 114 Controls 
  - The main part of the standard consists of 11 clauses
  - The clauses 0 - 3 describe the standard itself
  - Clauses 4 - 10 set the requirements for information security
  
The structure of ISO 27001
  -
  - Clause 0 which is the introductory clause gives a general overview of the standard
    - It expalins it's purpose and the compatibility with other ISO standards 
  - Clause 1 defines the scope of the standard
    - This standard is applicable to all types of organisation 
  - Clause 2 covers normative references and Clause 3 covers terms and definitions
    - Both refer to where ISO27001 security terms and definitions are given for the context of an organisation
  - Clause 4 covers the context of the organisation
    - It requires understanding internal and external issues, interested parties, their requirements and the ISMS scope
  - Clause 5 is for leadership and it defines the top management responsibilities
    - It sets the roles and responsibilities for the ISMS
    - It also defines the contents of the top level information security policy 
  - Clause 6 covers planning and defines requirements for risk assessment and risk treatment
    - Statement of applicability, risk treatment plan and setting information security objectives
  - Clause 7 covers support and the requirements for availability of resources
    - Competence, awareness, communication and control of documents 
  - Clause 8 is for operations and the requirements for regular reassessment of risks
    - Implementation of controls and other processes
  - Clause 9 covers performance evaluation and monitoring requirements
    - Monitoring, measurement, analysis, evaluation, internal audit and management review  
  - Clause 10 is for improvement and the related requirements
    - Nonconformities, corrections, corrective actions and continuous improvment
  - Annex A is called reference control, objectives and controls
    - https://www.strongdm.com/blog/iso-27001-controls
    - It is a catalogue of 114 controls grouped in 14 sections   
  
Information security principles 
  -
  - Information in this context is an asset which has value for the organisation
  - As with all assets this needs to be protected
  - Information can have many forms and can be stored on different types of media
    - This is normally digital or paper but can be in spoken form  
  - Information Security is defined as ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
    - Confidantiality is the assurance of data privacy ensuring that only authorised persons can access the information
    - Integrity means that only authorised persons can modify the data which protects the completeness of the data
    - Availability means that there will be reliable access to data and services for authorised users
  
Introduction to the Information Security Management System
  -
  - ISMS is a systematic approach to managing and protecting a companies information
  - It consists of organisation controls such policies and procedures which set the organisation security rules
    - It also consists of other types of controls such as technical controls 
  - What type of ISMS will be implemented will depend on the organisational requirements as well as risk assesments
    - Managagement will also have to decided which type of ISMS to implement 
  - For each type of risk there will need to be different types of controls
    - All people in the organisation should be trained on risks and made aware of them 
  - Information Security controls are never only IT or technical related
    - They should be a combination of different types of controls
    - Documenting a procedure is an organisational control
    - Implementing encryption is an IT control
    - Training and awareness is a Human Resources control
  - Information Security and IT security are not the same thing
    - Information security is a much wider field and is concerned with multiple types of information
    - This doesn't have to be just the information sent over IT networks 
  
Implementing ISO 27001 requirements 
  -
  - ISO27001 is the standard for establishing, implementing and maintaining the ISMS
  - In order to be compliant with ISO27001 an organisation has to implement all requirements from clauses 4 - 10
  - ISO27001 is best maintained using the PDCA cycle
    - This acronym stands for Plan, Do, Check, Act
    - It is a 4 phase cycle using all ISO standards for maintaining and continuous improvement of processes
    - The plan phase is about what to achieve and how to do it
      - This phase involves understanding the context of the organisation
      - Here is where the ISMS scope and the information security policy is planned
      - Risk assessment, documenting the statement of applicability and risk treatment plan is also done here
      - https://drata.com/blog/iso-27001-statement-of-applicability
    - The do phase is about the implementation of what has been planned
      - The implementation of the risk treatment plan is performed here
      -  
    - The check phase is about confirmation of whether things went as they should
    - The act phase is about closing the gap between what was planned and what was achieved
    - The last phase is also about improving how you do things
