Understanding Governance and Enterprise Risk Management In the Cloud		
  -
 	- Primary cloud administrative concerns are
		- Governance, enterprise risk management, information risk management, information security
	- Cloud Governance
 		- Organisation habits prior to the cloud will typically be accenuated in the cloud
			- Organisations that were very disciplined prior to using cloud services will benefit more quickly from using the cloud 
	 	- Policy is one of the most important elements in cloud governance
	 		- This is where an organisation will setup the expectation of codes of practice
			- Policies will state in clear brief language the things that should be followed
		- Processes are the life blood of cloud governance
			- Processes are the repeatable ways in which things are accomplished
	 		- They are imperative to the success of the organisation and its aims
		- Internal Controls will come in a number of different types
			- They can be anything from administrative to physical controls
	 		- In the cloud there will be an obvious set of technical controls
 	- Enterprise Risk Management
		- This is a holistic overall management or risk to the organisation
		- It is aligned to the risk tolerance of the organisation
		- It is considered as being beyond technology
	- Information Risk Management
 		- This takes various forms and can include paper, technology or service based information
	 	- Both data and metadata are included which can be difficult to find and identify
	 	- Intellectual property and different protections against loss are also part of information risk management 
 	- Information Security
		- This is directly tied to information risk and is a response to how those risks would be mitigated
		- There are an assortment of controls such as contracts
		- It can conceptually be thought of as providing a timeline to risk
	
Review of Governance Frameworks		
  -
	- A look at existing frameworks for use in an organisation
 	- ISO/IEC 38500:2015 Governance of IT for the organisation
		- This provides guidelines for members of governing bodies
		- Although it is usually comprised of senior members of an organisation it can also be comprised of advisors to the organisation
		- It is designed to work with an organisation in either its present or future state
		- It is also designed to be used modularly, the organisation size does not matter
		- The goal is to provide guidance in governance to organisations 
		- https://www.iso.org/standard/62816.html
	- ISACA
 		- This covers both the enactment of policies and standards
	 	- Managment should be involved from the beginning of the selection process
	 	- ISACA Cobit can be used to evaluate performance
	 	- https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit
 	- ISO/IEC 27014 Governance of Information Security
		- There are 2 pertinent elements
		- Scope which provides guidance of processes and principles
		- Purpose which addresses the fact that information security has become a key issue for organisations

Cloud Governance Tools		
  -
 	- There are 3 categories that tools will be in
		- Contracts, Compliance Reporting and Cloud Service Provider Assessments
	- Contractual Due Dilligence
 		- The primary tool here will be between the cloud provider and the cloud customer
	 	- This will be a binding arrangment for expectations
	 		- Contracts are actually designed for when things go bad
	 	- Understand the operational nuances in the cloud service being used
