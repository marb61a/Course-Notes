                    Secure Authentication for Web Apps & APIs Using JWTs


                    Section 1 - JSON Web Tokens
1 - Getting Started
Quick run through of the agenda
Course has made demo application available in angular 1 & 2 and also React
Course will use Angular 2 code samples
  - https://github.com/chenkie/angular2-user-authentication
  - https://github.com/chenkie/angular1-user-authentication
  - https://github.com/chenkie/react-user-authentication
    - ** if using the React version you may need to create an env file at the root of the project
API that course will be using, it requires having MongoDB installed
  - https://github.com/chenkie/user-authentication-api
Live version of the API is being served at this link
  - https://user-authentication-api-ocokqryugz.now.sh/api/


2 - Application & API Demonstration
Quick demonstration of the example application
The different frameworks are pretty much the same apart from a couple of lines
The Demo API
  - Is a simple REST APi that allows users to sign up and log in
  - When a user has been authenticated a JSON Web Token is returned in the response
  - The API has a resource called instructors which returns a list of instructors
A quick demonstration of what a JSON Web Token looks like under the bonnet
  - Response has the key token and long string
  - Postman is used as part of the demo and is a chrome based add on
    - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en


3 - Challenge: Run the Finished Application
The challenge is to to run the finished app in any of the frameworks available
You will need to access the API and view the documentation for its endpoints
You can also clone and run the API locally
There is also the option of creating a user for yourself at the /api/users endpoint in Postman
  - https://github.com/chenkie/user-authentication-api  
  - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop


4 - JSON Web Token Basics
There may be a bug in the react version login.js file
  - The onSignupSubmit should say this.props.auth.signup instead of this.props.auth.login
Also if Postman is causing payload errors set as form-data for the type
A JSON Web Token
  - It is an Open Standard RFC 7519
  - It is a method for transferring claims(assertions) between two parties securely through a JSON payload
  - A digitally signed and compact, self-contained package
  - It is also a great mechanism for stateless authentication
A JWT has 3 main sections
  - A header
    - JSON object that describes the token
    - Includes token type and signing algorithm
    - Signing algorithm is necessary for token verification
    - Commonly tokens are signed with HS256 or RS256
  - Payload 
    - JSON object that contains any claims abouth the entity for which it was issued
    - The JWT standard has a set of reserved claims
      - iss, sub, aud, exp, nbf, iat, jti
    - It can also contain arbitrary claims defined at will
  - Signature
    - A JSON object produced by Base64URL encoding the header and payload and then running through a hashing algorithm
    with a secret key
    - The signature is used as a means to digitally sign a token so that its validity can be verified later
    - If anything in the header or payload is modified the token will be invalidated
  

5 - Challenge: Inspecting a JWT
  - https://jwt.io/
  - JWT are often pronounced jot
  - The site allows you to decode, verify and generate JWT



                    Section 2 - JSON Web Tokens & Single Page Applications
1 - Traditional Authentication
Traditional client - server interactions were straightforware
  request <----> response
Modern interactions have become much more complex
Traditional authentication process
  - The user submits their credentials which are checked against a database
  - If everything checks out a session is created for them on the server and a cookie with session_id is sent back to the 
    browser
  - The cookie is sent back to the server on all subsequent requests and is verified against the session

There are some downside to this approach to authentication
  - Since a Single Page App does not refresh  how does it know that a user is logged in
    - Traditional apps construct views on the backend  which is where the authentication is checked
  - How do Single Page Apps receive their data, normally its a REST api through a XHR
    - REST api should be stateless and traditional authentication is stateful
  - Modern architecture relies on micro services and downstrem servers but cookies do not flow downstream
    - Communication between multiple servers with traditional auth is not easy
  - Access control will require database queries
    - This introduces a lot of general chattiness on the backend
  - This type of authentiaction does not scale well and can become very memory intensive
  - In traditional authentication the server does the heavy lifting

2 - JWT Authentication
User submits credentials which are then checked against a database
If everything is good then a token is signed and returned to the client in response
The token is saved on the client usually in a cookie or web storage
  - Using cookies will create some limitations
The token is sent as an Authorization header on every HTTP request
When the request is received on the backend, the JWT is verified against the secret that only the server knows
The payload is checked to route the the request based on the JWT's claims
  - This is usually done with middleware
If the JWT is valid the request is returned
If the JWT is invalid a 401 is returned

How Does This Help
The Single Page App (SPA) no longer relies on the backend to tell it whether the user is authenticated 
The backend can receive requests from multiple clients and the backend only cares that the token is valid
Requests can flow to downstreeam servers if necessary
The client tells the backend what is permissable instead of asking
  - This means that there is no need for user access lookups 

JWT's may be vulnerable if there is CSRF attacks to grab tokens

3 - Securing the Payload
Taking Q & A from the audience
JWT's can be implemented in SPA's but will look different
JWT supports encryption via JWE
More information available at
  - https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3
Demo app uses BCrypt for password hashing and is recommended by the instructor
Signing JWT Sunction Syntax
  // First the the user will be verified in the database
  // Then a token will be issued
  return jwt.sign({
    sub: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    email: user.email,
    gravatar: createGravatarUrl(user.email),
    scope
  // Secret should be unguessable, strings, about 64 in length
  // Best practice is to have it as an environmental variable and not to have it in a repository
  }, secret, { 
    algorithm: 'HS256',
    expiresIn: "1h" 
  });


4 - Implementing Authentication with JWT
How implementing JWT actually works in practice
How does the SPA get the JWT
  - The user submits their credentials
  - If the credentials are valid a JWT is signed and returned in response
  - A secret key known only by the server is used to sign the JWT
JWT Storage
Once the JWT comes back it will be stored somewhere in the user's browser
Storing in memory would be a poor choice as the token would be lost when the page is refreshed
JWT's are typically stored in browser storage(local storage or session storage) or in HTTP only cookies
Example Syntax -> uses the Angular 2 example app
  finishAuthentication(token): void{
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
    this.router.navigate([profile]);
  }
  
  logout(): void{
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
  }
Its very important to keep secret keys protected
Good practice is to have short lived tokens you should not have tokens with long expiry times
Expiry time should be around 10 hours
Expiry time is checked when the token is sent to the server
Removing the token from where it is being stored will logout due to it being stateless
If the user has copied the token it could mean that they are still logged in
Some organisations have issues with the way JWT's operate as revoking is not easy in JWT authentication
Login Component Syntax
  export class LoginComponent{
    errorMessage: string;
    
    constructor(private auth: AuthService){};
    
    onLoginSubmit(credentials){
      this.auth.login(credentials)
      .map(res => res.json())
      .subscribe(
        response => this.auth.finishAuthentication(response.token),
        error => this.errorMessage = error.josn().message;
      )
    }
    
    onSignupSubmit(credentials){
      this.auth.signup(credentials)
      .map(res => res.json())
      .subscribe(
        response => this.auth.finishAuthentication(response.token),
        error => this.errorMessage = error.josn().message;
      )
    }
  }

Auth Service Syntax
  @Injectable
  export class AuthService{
    constructor(private http: Http, private router: Router){}
    
    login(credentials): Observable<Response>{
      return this.http.post(`${API_URL}/users/authenticate`, credentials);
    }
    
    signup(credentials): Observable<Response>{
      return this.http.post('${API_URL}/users', credentials);
    }
    
    finishAuthentication(token): void{
      localStorage.setItem('token', token);
      this.router.navigate(['profile']);
    }
    
    logout(): void{
      localStorage.removeItem('token');
    }
  }


5 - Challenge: Creating the Login & Signup
The challenges for the section are
  - Checkout branch 01-implmenting-auth-starter
  - Create a screen for login and signup
  - Make a POST request with the user's credentials
  - Store the JWT that comes back in local storage
  - Create a logout method that removes the token from local storage
  - Provide buttons for Log In and Log Out in home view and toolbar
  
  // The Angular 2 version is available at
  - https://github.com/chenkie/angular2-user-authentication/tree/01-implementing-auth-starter

6 - Creating the Login & Signup Solution
Solution to Login and Signup Exercise - Uses the Angular 2 solution
App runs on port 4200 by default
Solution Syntax
  export class LoginComponent{
    errorMessage: string;
    constructor(private auth: AuthService){};
    
    onLoginSubmit(credentials){
      this.auth.login(credentials)
      .map(res => res.json())
      .subscribe(
        response => this.auth.finishAuthentication(response.token),
        error => this.errorMessage = error.josn().message;
      )
    }
    
    onSignupSubmit(credentials){
      this.auth.signup(credentials)
      .map(res => res.json())
      .subscribe(
        response => this.auth.finishAuthentication(response.token),
        error => this.errorMessage = error.josn().message;
      )
    }
  }
  
  @Injectable
  export class AuthService{
    constructor(private http: Http, private router: Router){}
    
    login(credentials): Observable<Response>{
      return this.http.post(`${API_URL}/users/authenticate`, credentials);
    }
    
    signup(credentials): Observable<Response>{
      return this.http.post('${API_URL}/users', credentials);
    }
    
    finishAuthentication(token): void{
      localStorage.setItem('token', token);
      this.router.navigate(['profile']);
    }
    
    logout(): void{
      localStorage.removeItem('token');
    }    
  }
  
  HTML Syntax
  <button class="btn btn-primary" routerLink="/login">
    Log In
  </button>
  // Auth is used because auth is injected in the component
  <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="auth.logout" routerLink="/home">
    Log Out
  </button>

Token will be stored in local stotage

 Section 3 - Client Side Sessions
1 - Server-Side vs. Client-Side Sessions
The previous example left log in and log out buttons which is not good practice or practical.
The material will cover usignclient sessions to set up the UI
Sessions
  - In the most general of term sessions are a means to preserve a desired state
    - In the example it will be to check to see if the user has been authenticated
Server-Side Sessions
  - This is a piece stored in memory or the database on the server that tracks information
  - For authentication purposes this generally means an identifier for the user
  - Ultimately it is used to make a determination about the users authentication status
  - Keeping server-side sessions this way is stateful
Client-Side Sessions
  - SPA's require a way to know if the user is authenticated or not
  - This cannot be done in the traditional way because the SPA is decoupled from the backend
  - JWT is a stateless mechanism which means that no user session exists on the server anyway
Client Sessions
  - How can we have clients sessions using a stateless authentication mechanism
    - The best indication that we can go by is whether or not the user's JWT has expired or not
    - The rationale for this is that if the JWT is expired it cannot be used to access protected resources
    - Because the authenication in this scenario is concerned with protecting resources it can be used
      as an idication of authenticator state
  - The flow in a client session shouold look something like
    - When a user logs in provide an application wide flag to indicate that user is logged in
    - At any point in the application lifecycle the token's exp can be checked against the current time
    - If the token expires then change the flag to indicate that the user is logged out
    - The check is commonly done when a route change occurs
      - If the token is expired redirect the user to the login route
      - Toggle appropriate markup for the user being logged out

Example Syntax
  export class AuthService{
    constructor(private http: HTTP, private router: Router){}
  }
  
  isAuthenticated(): boolean{
    return tokenNotExpired('token');
  }

Use *ngIf in the HTML templates so that he user will have different view depending on their login status

Example Syntax for different roles
  // Using Typescript as it is Angular 2 
  export class AuthService{
    constructor(private http: HTTP, private router: Router){}
    
    isAdmin(): boolean{
      return jwtdecode(this.gettoken()).scope === 'admin';
    }
    
    getUseRole(): string{
      return jwtdecode(this.gettoken()).scope();
    }
    
    getToken(): string{
      return localStorage.getItem('token');
    }
  }

2 - Q&A: JWT’s and Security
A series of questions and answers from students
Checking if a token is authenticated is a fairly thin layer of security but is useful to have as it
may prevent some access to resources.
Expiry time may not enable you to see if token is still valid
Deeper checks on token validtiy are possibe but come with a cost
Short expire time helps defend against token theft but you can also use token blacklisting but that maybe complex to setup
Change to expiry time is not valid as it will change the token
When developing an application firstly check if the solution is good enough and then look at the edge cases
  - EG expiry time should not be too short to affect user experience
Storing a token in a cookie may be more secure but it also my increase attack surface for XSS
You may need to ensure that your site is fortified against XSS
Do not put very sensitive information into a token
Token retrieval maybe possible after browser has closed but not with conventional tools or methods
Service Workers are an API for offline working in the browser

3 - Challenge: Expire Time
The challenges this time are
  - Checkout the 02-client-sessions-starter branch
  - Implement a function which uses the expiry time of the JWT to check whether or not a used is authenticated
    - The are libraries which may help with this
  - Conditionally show elements based on the authentication state
  - Users of Angular 1.x will have the easiest time
  - https://github.com/chenkie/angular2-user-authentication/tree/02-client-sessions-starter

4 - Expire Time Solution
Some Q & A from students
- Token refresh will be covered later
- Token deletion can occur usually using blacklisting
  - You will need an identifier for a specific token
    - You may use JTI claims to add identifiers to tokens
  - Using blacklisting may negate some of the JWT benefits
- https://github.com/chenkie/angular2-user-authentication/tree/02-client-sessions-solution
Example Syntax
  // Added to the auth service file, again Typescript will be used
  // In the authservice file there is a tokenNotExpired import from angular2-jwt
  isAuthenticated(): boolean{
    return tokenNotExpired('token');
  }
  
  // app.component.html Syntax
  // The same will be applied to the buttons in the home.component.html file
  // Will show if user is not authenticated
  <li *ngIf="!auth.isAuthenticated()"><a routerLink="/login">Log In</a></li>
  // Will show if user is authenticated
  <li *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated()"><a routerLink="/home" (click)="auth.logout()">Log Out</a></li>


                    Section 4 - User Information in the Payload
1 - Decoding a JWT
Finding user information in the payload
Example Syntax Profile Component
// You probably won't have that much information in the token about the user
  export class profileComponent implements OnInit{
    profile: Profile,
    payload: Object;
    
    constructor(private auth: AuthService){}
    
    ngOnInit(){
      this.profile = jwtDecode(this.auth.getToken());
      this.payload = jwtDecode(this.auth.getToken());
      this.profile.gravatar = `${this.profile.gravater}?s=200`;
    }
  }

2 - Payload Best Practices
Although tempting do not put the whole profile object in the payload
Important to keep the JWT small as it is sent over the network on all requests
Keep sensitive information out as JWT is decodable
Consider a separate endpoint which retrieves a user profile object if a lot of profile data is needed

3 - Challenge: Reading the Payload
The challenges for this section are
  - Checkout branch 03-user-profile-starter, available at
    - https://github.com/chenkie/angular2-user-authentication/tree/03-user-profile-starter
  - Read the user's profile from the JWT payload
    - There are libraries available
  - Display the user's details in a profile view question asked by a student about stale data
    - What happens if data becomes stale, eg user has elevated permissions during session, would user have to 
      log out and back in.
  - The solution once again is situation dependent and you may want to make use of a token blacklisting mechanism
    - There could also be a data checking mechanism introduced on the backend
  - You can use tokens as similar to API keys as they have the same granular control
    - You can fine tune what resources user has access to and what type of access eg read & write

4 - Reading the Payload Solution
Example Syntax
  // Use the jwtdecode library
  ngOnInit(){
    this.profile = jwtDecode(this.auth.getToken());
    this.payload = jwtDecode(this.auth.getToken());
    this.profile.gravatar = `${this.profile.gravater}?s=200`;
    
  }

                    Section 5 - Protecting Resources
1 - How JWT’s Protect Resources
Protecting resources is a very important part of JWT
  - The main point of adding authentication to an application is to restrict resource access to thoes who have
    proven that they are allowed access to those resources
  - There are different levels of access
    - Publically Accessible which means that resources are open to everyone
    - Limited to Authenticated Users which means the data is open to anyone that is logged in
    - Limited to only on e authenticated user which means data is open to only the user logged in
    - Limited to a subset of Authenticated Users which means that access is open to anyone of a particular privilege level
How do JWT's help us protect resources
  - We can create endpoints for our resources that require an authentication check
  - To pass the check a valid JWT must be present
  - When making HTTP requests we can send the JWT as an authentication header
  - The header is then read at the API and if valid then the resource becomes valid

2 - Exploring JWT Middleware
Exploring API Verification Code in the example server.js file
Example Syntax
  // This example uses hapi.js rather than express.js
  server.register(require('hapi-auth-jwt'), (err) => {
    // The name of the strategy in the example is jwt
    server.auth.strategy('jwt', 'jwt', 'required', {
      key: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
      verifyOptions: {
        algorithms: ['HS256']
      }
    })
  })

3 - Making Authenticated Requests
Sending authentication requests requires retrieving the JWT from storage and attaching it as an Authorization header
Some of the common implementations are
  - Explicitly on a per-request basis
  - Globally on all requests
  - Only requests of a certain kind
Storing the JWT in a cookie means that it will go to the server on every request
Example Syntax
  let headers = new Headers();
  // The Bearer is used as a authorisation scheme in oauth others include Digest and Basic
  headers.append('Authorization', 'Bearer' + token);
  this.http.get(API_URL, { headers })
    . map(res => res.json())
    .subscribe(data => console.log(data));
  
provideAuth Syntax using Angular 2 syntax
  @NgModule({
    declarations: [],
    imports: [],
    providers: [
      AuthService,
      AuthGuard,
      RoleGuard,
      provideAuth({
        tokenGetter : () => {return localStorage.getItem('token')}  
      }),
      instructorService
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
  })
  export class AppModule

                    Section 6 - Protecting Routes
1 - Client-Side Considerations
This section is about the approach to protecting routes in the application
Using SPA means that codes is not segemented into as many folders etc
There are considerations for the client-side that must be kept in mind
  - Server resources are limited to only requests that have a valid JWT
  - What about limiting access on the client side
  - Some common considerations are
    - Users should only be able to navigate to proteted routes if they are authenticated
    - If a route requires a certain access level users should only be able to navigate if they have the appropriate scope
    - Certain UI elements should only be rendered if the above conditions are met
Protecting client side routes and UI elements has a big problem, which is that it is easy to forge
  - The user can modify the exp time or scope in their own JWT
  - We cannot verify the signature of the JWT on the client side because the secret never leaves the server
Protecting Routes
  - But does it matter?
  - In the end protected resources should remain on the server anyway
    - Anything in the client-side is easily visible by anyone using dev-tools
  - If a user manages to hack their way into a protected route they won't be able to get resources from the server
Example Scenario
  - What happens if a User modifies the JWT
    - We use Javascript to limit a route to authenticated users who also have a scope of admin
    - A user who only has a scope of user decides to modify their JWT in the debugger at jwt.io
    - They gain access to the route which is populated by resources from the server
    - What happens?

2 - How Client-Side Routes are Protected
When a route transition begins the exp time in the JWT is checked
  - If the JWT is expired then the transition is disallowed
If a route requires a certain access level the scope in the JWT is checked when the transition starts
  - If the JWT does not include the desired scope then the transaction is disallowed
Implementation details do differ by framework
Many frameworks have their own implementations for controlling route access
  - Angular 1.x router events($routechangestart)
  - Angular 2, this implements a CanActivate hook
  - React (ReactRouter) has an onEnterEvent
Example Syntax
  export interface CanActivate {
    canActivate(route: ActivateRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot):
      Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean
  }

  @Injectable
  export classs AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
    constructor(private auth: AuthService, private router: Router){}
    
    canActivate(){
      if(this.auth.isAuthenticated()){
        return true;
      } else {
        this.router.navigate(['login'])
      }
    }
  }

3 - Challenge: Protecting Routes
Check out the 05 branch
  - 05-protecting-routes-starter
For the instructor route check that the user's JWT is unexpired before the route transition begins
For the instructor/new route check the the user's JWT is unexpired and that they have the scope of admin
Hide the new instructor button if the user is not an admin

4 - Protecting Routes Solution
Solution Syntax
  // The solution will look different from one framework to the other
  // authguard.service.ts file
  @Injectable()
  export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate{

    canActivate(){
      if(this.auth.isAuthenticated()){
        return true;
      } else {
        // Navigate to the login route if the user becomes unauthenticated
        this.router.navigate(['login']);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // In the app.routes.ts check to see that the user is authenticated
  {path: 'instructor', component: 'InstructorComponent', canActivate: [AuthGuard]}
  {path: 'instructor/new', component: 'NewInstructorComponent', canActivate: [RoleGuard]}
  
  //Roleguard.service.ts
  @Injectable()
  export class RoleGuard implements CanActivate{
    constructor(private auth: AuthService, private router: Router){}
    
    canActivate(){
      if(this.auth.isAuthenticated() && this.auth.isAdmin()){
        return true;
      } else {
        // Navigate to the login route if the user becomes unauthenticated
        this.router.navigate(['login']);

5 - Further Reading & Wrap-Up
There are some important security considerations to be mindful of
  - Nothing is 100% secure including JWT
  - Some common attack vectors include
    - XSS -- Cross Site Scripting (if using local storage)
    - CSRF -- Cross Site Request Forgery (if using cookies)
    - MITM -- Man In The Middle
  - Always server your app and API over HTTPS
  - Always escape user input and put CSRF protections in place if needed
  - JWT describes how computers can communicate securely with each other but does not recommend an implementation
  - It will be up to the person implementing it to decide if it is secure
  - OAuth and OIDC standardise authentication and authorization
    - They maybe the best solution for your needs in cases despite the complexity
Refresh Tokens
  - These are a very special type of token which is exchanged for a new JWT
  - They can be used to extend a client session
  - Refresh tokens should not be stored on the browser and should only live on the server
