Understanding The Need For Privacy
Evolving Compliance Requirements
  - New threats and technologies can impact on approach to compliance
  - It professionals must be able to respond to organisational needs as well as predicting how events may effect the organisation
  - Good internal privacy procedures can help attract and keep employees
  - The same is also true of investors, business partners as well as customers
  - NCASE are FTC rules -> Notice, Choice, Access, Security and Enforcement
  - Notice refers to the notice a person should be given prior to collecting any information about them
  - Choice is the options that people are given as to how collected information may be used
  - Access is a person's ability to access data about themselves and challenge its accuracy
  - Security in this instance refers to managerial and technical security measures which are needed to protect against wrong access or destruction of data
    - Measures to protect against unauthorised access include encryption of data both at storage and transport
  - Enforcement is needed because privacy protection can only be effective if there is a mechanism for enforcing them

Major Risks To A Company IT Framework
  - Each type of system has it's own set of requirements that must be addressed
  - Failure in addressing requirements can cause issues such as improper controls or retention policy application
  - There are multiple IT risks and they could potentially lead to customer loss ar even fines for the organisation
    - Client Side refers to the computers that are used by employees etc
      - This side can be a significant threat to the organisation as often sensitive data is on these computers
      - Client computers should be protected against threats such as potential espionage by rivals 
      - Clients side users should be made aware of privacy obligations
      - There should training provided before accessing personal data
      - Initial access should also display a warning reminder of policies and a link to them
    - Server Side
      - Often server side can have the same vulnerabilities as client side
      - These risks can be mitigated or minimised
      - There are several types of applications that are not needed on servers such as social applications and should not be on servers
      - Reducing applications reduces attack surface ares
      - If possible all data on a server should be classified on its origin, purpose, sensitivity and category
      - Any linkage between dataset may break an organisation privacy rules
  - Security Policay and Personnel
    - Privacy cannot be assured unless practical measures have been established
    - Each organiastion should have a security policy in place along with compliance and security personnel to enforce it
    - A PIA or privacy impact assessment can detect any gaps in policies to protect information and address needed actions
