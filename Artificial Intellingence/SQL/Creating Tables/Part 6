Exercise
Peter is really happy with his website and he decided to open a dedicated webstore with products for people who fell in love. 
Heart-shaped balloons, rings, fresh flowers - anything you can imagine. Let's create a table product for him. 
Take a look at the description below, decide on the data types and provide a suitable SQL statement.
Each product has an id which is an integer number and a name which is 64 characters long at most. 
It also has a description which can be of any length. We also need the price for each product (all of them cost below 300.00 dollars).

Solution
CREATE TABLE product (
	id INT,
  	name VARCHAR(64),
  	description CLOB,
  	price DECIMAL(5, 2)
)


Instruction
We can now move on to another data type.
BOOLEAN is a data type used to store logical values: true or false. This data type usually answers a yes/no question like "Does the user keep pets?". 
BOOLEAN types are convenient because they require really little space.
For your information, some databases don't have a separate BOOLEAN type and they simulate it using other types.

Exercise
Some users complain that there are fake accounts on the dating website. Peters wants to introduce a new feature - user verification. 
For now, let's create a simple table called verification with two columns: user_id (integer) and is_verified (boolean).

Solution
CREATE TABLE verification(
	user_id INT,
  	is_verified BOOLEAN
)


Exercise
Our user with user_id 13 has just been verified (column is_verified). Let's put this information into table verification.

Solution
INSERT INTO verification VALUES(
	13, true
)


Exercise
Let's see who is trustworthy on the website. Select all user_id values from the table verification where the users were verified (column is_verified).

Solution
SELECT user_id 
FROM verification
WHERE is_verified = true
