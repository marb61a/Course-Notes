Exercise
Peter is really happy with his website and he decided to open a dedicated webstore with products for people who fell in love. 
Heart-shaped balloons, rings, fresh flowers - anything you can imagine. Let's create a table product for him. 
Take a look at the description below, decide on the data types and provide a suitable SQL statement.
Each product has an id which is an integer number and a name which is 64 characters long at most. 
It also has a description which can be of any length. We also need the price for each product (all of them cost below 300.00 dollars).

Solution
CREATE TABLE product (
	id INT,
  	name VARCHAR(64),
  	description CLOB,
  	price DECIMAL(5, 2)
)


Instruction
We can now move on to another data type.
BOOLEAN is a data type used to store logical values: true or false. This data type usually answers a yes/no question like "Does the user keep pets?". 
BOOLEAN types are convenient because they require really little space.
For your information, some databases don't have a separate BOOLEAN type and they simulate it using other types.

Exercise
Some users complain that there are fake accounts on the dating website. Peters wants to introduce a new feature - user verification. 
For now, let's create a simple table called verification with two columns: user_id (integer) and is_verified (boolean).

Solution
CREATE TABLE verification(
	user_id INT,
  	is_verified BOOLEAN
)


Exercise
Our user with user_id 13 has just been verified (column is_verified). Let's put this information into table verification.

Solution
INSERT INTO verification VALUES(
	13, true
)


Exercise
Let's see who is trustworthy on the website. Select all user_id values from the table verification where the users were verified (column is_verified).

Solution
SELECT user_id 
FROM verification
WHERE is_verified = true


Exercise
We've got a very simple table called holiday which stores information about national holidays in a given year. It has two columns: name and day. 
Let's select the columns name and day for all rows to see how dates are stored in SQL.

Solution
SELECT name, day 
FROM holiday


Exercise
For Peter, the Valentine's Day is an important holiday. Let's put the date 14 Feb 2016 into the table holiday.
To escape an apostrophe in Valentine's Day, you can write:
'Valentine''s Day'

Solution
INSERT INTO holiday VALUES(
	'Valentine''s Day',
  	'2016-02-14'
)


Exercise
In the table holiday, select all the information for all the holidays which happened after 1 Jan 2012.

Solution
SELECT * 
FROM holiday
WHERE day > '2012-01-01'


Exercise
Peter needs a more precise payment information system. Let's create a table called payment with the following columns: user_id (integer), 
amount (decimal with 6 digits before the decimal and 2 after it), day (date).

Solution
CREATE TABLE payment(
	user_id INT,
  	amount DECIMAL(6, 2),
  	day DATE
)


Instruction
The next data type we're going to learn is time. The format for this type is hh:mm:ss, where hh stands for hour, mm for minutes and ss for seconds. 
It's used to store time (e.g. in timetables). This type of column again requires apostrophes.
Please note that this data type is absent from many databases.

Exercise
When Peter found out about the new data type, he immediately added another column called precise_time to his table. Now, the payment table has the following columns:

    user_id of type integer,
    amount of type decimal(6,2),
    day of type date,
    precise_time of type time.

It's time for you to play around! Insert new rows into the table, select some rows with a specific time etc.

Solution
No solution needed
