Instruction
Well done! That was quite a lot of typing, right?
Well, this is where views come in handy. In SQL, a view is a "remembered" query. 
If we repeatedly perform the same complicated query, we have to write it from scratch every time.
When we create a view, the database can remember the query for us. All we need to remember is the name of the view.
In the teaching center database, there is some historical data - for instance, there are some courses which are no longer run (their next_edition field is NULL). 
So, each time we want to retrieve some information for only those courses which are actually run, we have to write:

SELECT *
FROM course 
WHERE next_edition IS NOT NULL;

A view could make our life easier. Take a look:

CREATE VIEW current_course AS 
SELECT *
FROM course 
WHERE next_edition IS NOT NULL;

As you can see, we provided the keywords CREATE VIEW, followed by the name of the view and the keyword AS. 
And that's it. A view will be created with the query we specify afterwards.

Exercise
Alright. Create the view course_lecturer joining courses and lecturers as in the previous exercise. To save you some typing, we have put the query in the template

Solution
CREATE VIEW course_lecturer  AS 
SELECT 
  course.id AS course_id,
  course.name AS course_name,
  course.description AS course_description,
  course.first_edition AS course_first_edition,
  course.next_edition AS course_next_edition,
  course.lecturer_id AS course_lecturer_id,
  lecturer.id AS lecturer_id,
  lecturer.first_name AS lecturer_first_name,
  lecturer.last_name AS lecturer_last_name,
  lecturer.started_work AS lecturer_started_work,
  lecturer.ended_work AS lecturer_ended_work
FROM course
JOIN lecturer
  ON course.lecturer_id = lecturer.id;


Exercise
Excellent! We have just created the view. How can we use it? Well, a view is a virtual table: it has its name, some columns and rows, like any other table. 
The view data is not stored physically, every time you retrieve data from the view, the database reruns the underlying query.
We can use a view in our queries just as we use other tables. Take a look:

SELECT *
FROM course_lecturer;

The above query will select all the information for courses together with their lecturers.
