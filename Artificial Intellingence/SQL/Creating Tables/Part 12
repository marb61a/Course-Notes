Instruction
Once we create a sequence, we can use a special instruction to retrieve the next value for it. 
The code varies depending on the database, so don't worry if it's different from the one we presented below.

SELECT nextval('first_seq');

The above code will select the next value for the sequence named first_seq. 
It is possible to associate a sequence with values in a column, but we'll discuss it in another part of our course. For now, just remember what sequences are.

Exercise
Select the next value for your new sequence my_sequence.

Solution
SELECT nextval('my_sequence')


Exercise
Let's get started with the review. Use the ERD diagram below to create the proper table.

Solution
CREATE TABLE festival(
	code CHAR(8) PRIMARY KEY,
  	name VARCHAR(20),
  	start TIMESTAMP,
  	end TIMESTAMP,
  	participants INT,
  	score DECIMAL(2, 1)
)


Exercise
We want a table called parcel which will register pieces of land within our country. The table has the following columns:

    city - up to 25 characters,
    street - up to 25 characters,
    num - an integer,
    area - a real number,
    state_owned - a yes/no field.

We want the first three columns to form the primary key

Solution
CREATE TABLE parcel(
	city VARCHAR(25),
  	street VARCHAR(25),
  	num INT,
  	area REAL,
  	state_owned BOOL,
  	PRIMARY KEY(city, street, num)
)
