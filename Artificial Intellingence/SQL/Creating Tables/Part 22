Exercise
Experiment again! Use the template code we provided, choose the type of foreign key you want by deleting the double hyphen (--) 
from the line of the option you want to try. You can use the update/delete we provided in the Hint or make up your own.
Remember: each time you press the Run and check code button your code starts fresh. The changes you made in one call are not preserved in the next call.

Solution
CREATE TABLE project (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(1000)  NOT NULL,
  description varchar(255)  NOT NULL,
  manager_id int  NOT NULL,
--FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employee (id) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE SET NULL,
--FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employee (id) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT,
--FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employee (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION,
)


Exercise

  	is_obligatory BOOL,
  	lecturer_id INT,
  	FOREIGN KEY (lecturer_id)
  	REFERENCES lecturer(id)
)
