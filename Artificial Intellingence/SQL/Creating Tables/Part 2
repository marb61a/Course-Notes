Instruction
Now, if you want to put more than one column in your table, just use commas between them:

CREATE TABLE airplane (
   id int,
   max_passengers int
);

As you can see, we've added another column max_passengers (also a number-type column) to our example table.

Exercise
Let's create a more sophisticated version of the previous table. Create a table named result with three number columns: id, score and year.

Solution
CREATE TABLE result(
	id int,
  	score int,
  	year int
);


Instruction
Let's add another column to our example - this time not a number:

CREATE TABLE airplane (
   id int,
   max_passengers int,
   model varchar(32)
);

As you can see, we put varchar(32) instead of int for the column model. The data type varchar is a column type used to store text values. 
In the parentheses, you should specify the maximum length of any value in that column (32 stands for 32 characters). 
Try to keep it as small as possible - the greater the value, the more space the database will require!
Please note that Oracle database uses varchar2 where other database use varchar.

Exercise
Create a table named result with the following three columns:

    id - a number,
    name - a text of 32 characters at most, and
    score - a number again.

Solution
CREATE TABLE result(
	id int,
  	name varchar(32),
  	score int
)


Instruction
A table in an ERD diagram is represented by a rectangle with its name. There are also all of the columns listed together with their data types. 
There can be more kinds of information shown in the diagrams - you will learn about them in another part of the course.

Exercise
Based on the ERD diagram below, write the proper SQL statement which will create the table in the database.

Solution
CREATE TABLE product(
	id int,
  	name varchar(32),
  	brand varchar(32),
  	price int
)


Instruction
You know how to create simple tables already. The last thing we want to present in this introductory part is how to remove a table from a database.

DROP TABLE airplane;

Piece of cake, isn't it? The above instruction will completely remove the table named airplane. 
Please remember that the content of the table is removed too - be careful when you drop tables, then!

Exercise
Remove the table named result from the database.

Solution
DROP TABLE result


Instruction
We'll start off with text information. This is a data type which we can use to store words and expressions like 'barbecue', 'Hannah Smith' or 'Maroon5'.
In SQL, text information is always stored between two single quotation marks '(apostrophes). 
They are important, because they tell our database 'Hey, this is text information!'.

Exercise
Do you still remember Peter from the first part of our course and his childhood museum? Well, his idea didn't really work out. 
He now has a new idea in mind - an online dating website! In this part of the course, we're going to help him develop this new brilliant idea.
He hasn't done much so far. There is only a single table user_account in his database with a single column named nickname. 
Let's practice working with text information by putting his first user Kangaroo19 into the table. Remember about the quotation marks!

Solution
INSERT INTO user_account VALUES(
	'Kangaroo19'
)
