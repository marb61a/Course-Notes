Instruction
Now, if you want to put more than one column in your table, just use commas between them:

CREATE TABLE airplane (
   id int,
   max_passengers int
);

As you can see, we've added another column max_passengers (also a number-type column) to our example table.

Exercise
Let's create a more sophisticated version of the previous table. Create a table named result with three number columns: id, score and year.

Solution
CREATE TABLE result(
	id int,
  	score int,
  	year int
);


Instruction
Let's add another column to our example - this time not a number:

CREATE TABLE airplane (
   id int,
   max_passengers int,
   model varchar(32)
);

As you can see, we put varchar(32) instead of int for the column model. The data type varchar is a column type used to store text values. 
In the parentheses, you should specify the maximum length of any value in that column (32 stands for 32 characters). 
Try to keep it as small as possible - the greater the value, the more space the database will require!
Please note that Oracle database uses varchar2 where other database use varchar.

Exercise
Create a table named result with the following three columns:

    id - a number,
    name - a text of 32 characters at most, and
    score - a number again.

Solution
CREATE TABLE result(
	id int,
  	name varchar(32),
  	score int
)
