Exercise
Insert a new game into the table card_game and specify only the following information: name 'Citadels', genre 'historical'. 
What do you think will happen? Take a look at the resulting row.

Solution
INSERT INTO card_game (name, genre)
VALUES(
	'Citadels',
  	'historical'
)


Exercise
Let's try to insert another card_game. The name is 'Three Dragon Ante', genre 'fantasy'. As for the columns min_players, min_time and cooperation, 
force a NULL value by providing it in the INSERT statement. Take a look at the inserted row. What happened?

Solution
INSERT INTO card_game (name, genre, min_players, min_time, cooperation)
VALUES(
	'Three Dragon Ante',
  	'fantasy',
  	NULL,
  	NULL,
  	NULL
)


Instruction
Well, the values have been set to NULL because this is what the user wanted. As you can see, the DEFAULT constraint does not forbid NULL values in the given column. 
It only provides a value on its own when the user forgets to mention the specific column in the instruction.

Exercise
Again, try to create the table card_game on your own. The template is ready. All you need to do is add DEFAULT constraints:

    the value 2 for min_players,
    the value 60 for min_time and
    FALSE for cooperation.

Have a go! 

Solution
CREATE TABLE card_game (
  id IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(32) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  genre varchar(32),
  min_players int DEFAULT 2,
  min_time int DEFAULT 60,
  cooperation boolean DEFAULT False
)
