Instruction
Let's move on to number data types. We've learned the following:

    INTEGER, used for storing integer numbers,
    DOUBLE and REAL, used for storing floating point numbers and
    DECIMAL used for precise calculations with money. For instance, DECIMAL(5,3) means that there will be 5 digits altogether, of which 3 are after the decimal sign.
    
Exercise
XYZ Bank is very unfortunate - they experienced several acts of embezzlement in the past. They want to keep record of these events.
Let's create a table fraud with the following columns:

    employee_id (an integer),
    amount (money value with 10 digits altogether and two after the decimal sign).
    
Solution
CREATE TABLE fraud(
	employee_id INTEGER,
  	amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
)


Exercise
In the European Grand Star Hotel, there are some rooms with a sauna installed inside the bathroom. Let's make a small table room_sauna with the columns:

    room_id (integer) and
    sauna_available (boolean).

Solution
CREATE TABLE room_sauna(
	room_id INTEGER,
 	sauna_available BOOLEAN 
)


Exercise
The local university wants us to create a table with the dates of exams during the examination period.
Let's create a table called exam with the following colums:

    exam_id (integer number),
    lecture_id (integer number) and
    date_time (a column with both the date and the exact time).

Solution
CREATE TABLE exam (
	exam_id INTEGER,
  	lecture_id INTEGER,
  	date_time TIMESTAMP
)


Exercise
Take a closer look at the example code with our table movie. Can you see anything new? When you do, press the Run and check code button to create the table. 

Solution
CREATE TABLE movie (
   id int primary key,
   name varchar(64),
   year int
)


Instruction
Okay, have you noticed the new element in the code? You should be familiar with the instruction:

CREATE TABLE movie (
   id int PRIMARY KEY,
   title varchar(64),
   year int
);

It will create a table called movie with the columns specified in the parentheses. There, we provide column names with their types. 
However, after the part id int, we put the following piece of information:

PRIMARY KEY

In this part of the course, we're going to examine primary keys closely. What are they? 
A primary key is a set of columns which is used to identify a given row in the table. Sounds too vague? Don't worry, we're going to explain that soon!

Exercise
We've put some information into the table movie. Take a close look at the contents of the table.
Examine the column id which is the primary key. Each id is unique - the same number only appears once.
Apart from that, we do not have id 7. That's correct - primary keys do not need to follow any specific order. If number 7 is missing, nothing particular happens. 

Solution
SELECT *
FROM movie


Instruction
As you could see, each id was indeed unique and they were generally speaking consecutive numbers. One number was missing (7), but nothing particular happens. 
You will, however, discover soon enough that no two rows can share the same value in the primary key column.

Exercise
Okay, let's add a movie with id 7 so that there is no gap in numbering. Its title is Titanic and it was produced in 1997

Solution
INSERT INTO movie VALUES(
	7, 'Titanic', 1997
)
