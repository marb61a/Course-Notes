Instruction
Let's move on to number data types. We've learned the following:

    INTEGER, used for storing integer numbers,
    DOUBLE and REAL, used for storing floating point numbers and
    DECIMAL used for precise calculations with money. For instance, DECIMAL(5,3) means that there will be 5 digits altogether, of which 3 are after the decimal sign.
    
Exercise
XYZ Bank is very unfortunate - they experienced several acts of embezzlement in the past. They want to keep record of these events.
Let's create a table fraud with the following columns:

    employee_id (an integer),
    amount (money value with 10 digits altogether and two after the decimal sign).
    
Solution
CREATE TABLE fraud(
	employee_id INTEGER,
  	amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
)


Exercise
In the European Grand Star Hotel, there are some rooms with a sauna installed inside the bathroom. Let's make a small table room_sauna with the columns:

    room_id (integer) and
    sauna_available (boolean).

Solution
CREATE TABLE room_sauna(
	room_id INTEGER,
 	sauna_available BOOLEAN 
)


Exercise
The local university wants us to create a table with the dates of exams during the examination period.
Let's create a table called exam with the following colums:

    exam_id (integer number),
    lecture_id (integer number) and
    date_time (a column with both the date and the exact time).

Solution
CREATE TABLE exam (
	exam_id INTEGER,
  	lecture_id INTEGER,
  	date_time TIMESTAMP
)
