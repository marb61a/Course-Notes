Instruction
Finally, we're going to learn a mixture of the types date and time - datetime, which is also called timestamp. The format for timestamp is yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss. 
As you can see, it includes both the date and the time. It has various names in various databases: timestamp, datetime, smalldatetime. 
In our database, all of these names work.
