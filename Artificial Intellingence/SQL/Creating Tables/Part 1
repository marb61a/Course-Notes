Instruction
Welcome to the course Creating Tables in SQL. We assume that you already know how to use tables in a database: how to create queries and how to modify data in them. 
If not, why don't you check out our previous courses first? We have a course on SQL queries and another one about data operations in SQL.
In this course, you're going to learn how to create tables. You're now going to create your very first table. 
See that SQL code on the right? You may not understand it yet, but don't worry. We'll explain the instructions in this course.

Exercise
Peter loves toys and he decided to open a museum of childhood in his city. In the museum, he wants to show various kinds of toys from the past, 
coming from all over the world.
As you can see, he has already written some code. This code is going to create a table where he will store data about all of his exhibits.
Why don't you help him create it? Click Run and check code to see how the table is created. 

Solution
CREATE TABLE exhibit (
   id int,
   name varchar(64),
   country varchar(32),
   production_year int
);


Instruction
Excellent! You have just created your first table! Its name is exhibit and it has the following columns: id, name, country, and production_year.
For now, our table is empty. Let's fill it up with some data. We have an entire course which deals with data insertion, modification and deletion,
but here's a little reminder:

INSERT INTO exhibit VALUES (10, 'Doll', 'USA', 1995);

The above statements adds a new row to the table called exhibit with the values

    10 for column id,
    'Doll' for column name,
    'USA' for column country, and
    1995 for column production_year.

Note that we put quotes around text like 'Doll', but not around numbers like 1995. 
Remember to specify the values in this exact order - this is the same order in which we provided column names when creating the table. 

Exercise
Peter has gathered a few toys already and he wants to insert them into the table exhibit. 
Help him add a Matryoshka with id 1. The toy comes from Russia and was produced in 1989.

Solution
INSERT INTO 
EXHIBIT VALUES(
	1, 'Matryoshka', 'Russia', 1989
)
