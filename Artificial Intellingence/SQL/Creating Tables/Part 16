Instruction
You should also know that we can use other columns in the CHECK constraint as well. Take a look at the example below:

CREATE TABLE video_game (
     id IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
     name varchar(32) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     genre varchar(32) NOT NULL,
     studio varchar(32),
     multiplayer boolean,
     hours int,
     price decimal(5,2),
     CHECK (price/hours < 1.00)
);

In the example above, the database will only allow you to enter relatively cheap video games, where the cost of the game divided by the hours of playing is low.

Exercise
We inserted the constraint from our example into the database. Let's try to insert a new game which meets the criteria. Insert a game called 'Disciples II' into the table video_game:

    genre is strategy,
    studio dat,
    multiplayer TRUE,
    hours 150 and
    price 29.99.

Solution
INSERT INTO video_game(
	name, genre, studio, multiplayer, hours, price
) VALUES (
	'Disciples II',
  	'strategy',
  	'dat',
  	True,
  	150,
  	29.99
)


Exercise
Try to update the price in the table video_game where the name of the game is 'Disciples II'. Set the price to 250.00.

Solution
// Causes error but not solution needed
UPDATE video_game 
SET price = 250.00 
WHERE name = 'Disciples II
