Exercise
Add a movie with id 13 to the table movie. The title is Boyhood and it was produced in 2014.

Solution
INSERT INTO movie VALUES(
	13, 'Boyhood', 2014
)


Exercise
Try to add a new movie with an id between 1 and 10 and see what happens. When you're done, press the button to continue.

Solution
// Will Fail
INSERT INTO movie (id, title, year) 
VALUES (..., ..., ...)


Exercise
Add a new movie with a NULL id value. You can use the template code we prepared for you or you can write your own.

Solution
// Will Fail
INSERT INTO movie 
VALUES (NULL, 'The Lord of The Rings', 2001)


Instruction
We usually choose a single column to become our primary key. If we want to inform our database that a given column is supposed to be the primary key 
(often abbreviated as PK), we place the keywords PRIMARY KEY after the name and type of the column:

CREATE TABLE movie (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(40)
);

Exercise
You are now going to create your own table with a primary key.
Let's reconstruct our table movie so that it has the following columns:

    film_id which is an integer number and the primary key,
    title which is a field of up to 64 characters,
    year which is an integer and
    genre which is a text of up to 10 characters.

Solution
CREATE TABLE movie(
	film_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  	title VARCHAR(64),
  	year INTEGER,
  	genre VARCHAR(10)
)


Instruction
Now, you may wonder if the primary key must always be an integer column. The answer is no. You can choose other column types as well. 
For instance, you could give up the id column in our movie table and use the title of the movie as the primary key.
Are such solutions popular? Well, not really. Such a primary key will work more slowly and is more difficult to handle.

Exercise
Let's experiment. Create the table movie WITHOUT the id column. Put the following columns:

    title which is a field of up to 64 characters and the primary key,
    year which is an integer and
    genre which is a text of up to 10 characters.

Solution
CREATE TABLE movie(
	title VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
  	year INTEGER,
  	genre VARCHAR(10)
)


Instruction
Alright. As you can see, it's possible to use a varchar column as the primary key, but it is not advisable.
Primary keys are important, so we mark which column the primary key is in ERD diagrams too. We usually use the abbreviation PK:

Exercise
Try to create the database using the following ERD diagram

Solution
CREATE TABLE account(
	user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  	first_name VARCHAR(32),
  	nickname VARCHAR(24),
  	description CLOB
)


Exercise
Run the template code we created for you. As you can see, we tried to set both the id and title columns as the primary keys. Do you think we will succeed?

Solution
CREATE TABLE movie (
   id int PRIMARY KEY,
   title varchar(64) PRIMARY KEY,
   year int
)
