Instruction
We usually choose a single column to become our primary key. If we want to inform our database that a given column is supposed to be the primary key 
(often abbreviated as PK), we place the keywords PRIMARY KEY after the name and type of the column:

CREATE TABLE movie (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(40)
);

Exercise
You are now going to create your own table with a primary key.
Let's reconstruct our table movie so that it has the following columns:

    film_id which is an integer number and the primary key,
    title which is a field of up to 64 characters,
    year which is an integer and
    genre which is a text of up to 10 characters.

Solution
CREATE TABLE movie(
	film_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  	title VARCHAR(64),
  	year INTEGER,
  	genre VARCHAR(10)
)
