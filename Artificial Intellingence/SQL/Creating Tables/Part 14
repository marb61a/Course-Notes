Exercise
Try to add a new RPG game to the table without specifying the name of the game. What do you think will happen?

Solution
// Will cause error
INSERT INTO rpg_game (id, genre, classes_no, complexity, min_players) VALUES ( ... )


Exercise
It's your time to create the table rpg_game with a NOT NULL column. Our table rpg_game should have the following columns:

    id - identity and the primary key,
    name of up to 32 characters which must be unique and must not be a NULL,
    genre of up to 32 characters,
    and three integer columns: classes_no, complexity, min_players.

Solution
CREATE TABLE rpg_game(
	id IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  	name VARCHAR(32) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  	genre VARCHAR(32),
  	classes_no INT,
  	complexity INT,
  	min_players INT
)


Instruction
The table has been created. Now, you may wonder what happens when we do not provide the NOT NULL constraint. Let's find out.

Exercise
Run the template code without the NOT NULL constraints. In the next exercise, we'll try to add a few rows.

Solution
CREATE TABLE rpg_game (
    id IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(32) UNIQUE,
    genre varchar(32),
    classes_no int,
    complexity int,
    min_players int,
)
