Great! You can also show foreign keys in ERD diagrams. To do that, we use the abbreviation FK.
For instance, the ERD for the table you've just created can look as follows:
As you can see, manager_id is a foreign key in this table because it's marked with FK. 
There is a line between the table department and the table employee because there is a connection between them -
the column manager_id in the table department points to the table employee.

Exercise
Our database is getting bigger. We now have another table position which will store information about various positions available in a given department. 
Use the ERD below to create the proper table.

Solution
CREATE TABLE position(
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  	department_id INT NOT NULL,
  	FOREIGN KEY(department_id)
  	REFERENCES department(id)
)


Instruction
That's right. Okay, time to move on. So far, we've created foreign keys on single columns. We know, however, that primary keys may comprise multiple columns, 
so there must be a way to create multiple column foreign keys too.
Let's say we have a new table called office which describes a physical location of an office in a given building on a given floor:
Let's say the primary key will consist of two columns: floor and building_name. 
There may be many offices on the third floor in various building and there may be many offices on different floors in one building, 
but together, these values form a primary key. We'll now learn how to create the proper multicolumn foreign key for this situation. 
Take a look, you just need to provide all the columns in the parentheses:

FOREIGN KEY (office_floor,office_building_name)
REFERENCES office (floor,building_name)

The columns office_floor and office_building_name will form a multicolumn foreign key. Excellent!

Exercise
Each department will be located in a specific office, so we need to change our table department 
so that it contains a multicolumn foreign key pointing to the table office. Take a look at the new ERD for the table department:
Now take a look at the template code which will create this table with a multicolumn foreign key.
As you may remember, the column manager_id used to be a foreign key, and now it's not. 
This is because we don't know how to create more than one foreign key in a table yet. Don't worry, we'll get to that in a second. 
For now, focus on creating a multicolumn foreign key.

Solution
CREATE TABLE department (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(1000)  NOT NULL,
  manager_id int  NOT NULL,
  office_floor int  NOT NULL,
  office_building_name varchar(255)  NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (office_floor, office_building_name)
  REFERENCES office (floor, building_name)
)


Exercise
It's time to play around with the new foreign key. Take a look at the tables and try the following things:

    Insert a new department with an office_floor which doesn't exist.
    Try to update an existing row in the table department and change the office_building_name to a value which doesn't exist in the table office.
    Update a row in the table office. Change either the floor or the building name and see what happens.

Solution
// No solution needed but there are some suggested examples
1. INSERT INTO department VALUES (10, 'Customer Service', 2, 3, 'Skyline');
2. UPDATE department SET office_building_name = 'Example' WHERE office_building_name = 'Zebra';
3. UPDATE office SET floor = 5 WHERE floor = 3;


Instruction
If you had done everything correctly, you shouldn't have been able to perform any of the tasks we prepared. 
The database keeps all information consistent, just as it does in case of single column foreign keys.

Exercise
Last time we prepared the template code for you, now it's your turn to make it work! 
Provide the proper code to create the table department shown in the diagram below:
The columns office_floor and office_building_name should form a single foreign key.

Solution
CREATE TABLE department (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(1000)  NOT NULL,
  manager_id int  NOT NULL,
  office_floor int  NOT NULL,
  office_building_name varchar(255)  NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (office_floor, office_building_name)
  REFERENCES office (floor, building_name)
)


Instruction
Okay, we've promised to teach you how to create multiple foreign keys in a single table and here we go:

CREATE TABLE table1 (
  column1 int NOT NULL,
  column2 int NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY(column1) REFERENCES table2(column3),
  FOREIGN KEY(column2) REFERENCES table3(column4)
);

As you can see, if you want to create another foreign key, you just need to repeat the whole FOREIGN KEY construction after a comma. 
Do not provide all the column names inside one pair of parentheses - this won't create multiple foreign keys, but a single multicolumn foreign key instead!

Exercise
Let's create the table department once again - this time with two separate foreign keys:

    one on column manager_id pointing to employee.id and
    the other on two columns: office_floor (referring to office.floor) an office_building_name (referring to office.building_name).

Solution
CREATE TABLE department (
  id int PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(1000)  NOT NULL,
  manager_id int  NOT NULL,
  office_floor int  NOT NULL,
  office_building_name varchar(255)  NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (manager_id)
  REFERENCES employee(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (office_floor, office_building_name)
  REFERENCES office (floor, building_name)
)
