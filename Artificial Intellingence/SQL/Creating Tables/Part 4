Instruction
Just as you could expect, it's not possible to enter a longer value into a char(x) column.
We're now going to introduce another text data type. Depending on the database, it's called TEXT or CLOB. In our database, both names refer to the same data type.
This data type is used to store text information of any length. You can store one word and a thousand words in such a column.

Exercise
Peter decided that the old table user_account was not enough and that the 10-character-long nicknames didn't really work. 
What's more, he wants users to describe themselves! Let's create a new table user_account with the following columns:

    first_name of type varchar(32),
    nickname of type varchar(32),
    description of type clob.

Solution
CREATE TABLE user_account(
	first_name VARCHAR(32),
  	nickname VARCHAR(32),
  	description CLOB
)


Exercise
Peter developed a slightly more sophisticated version of the table user_account and provided us with a simple ERD. Based on the diagram below, create the proper table.

Solution
CREATE TABLE user_account(
	first_name VARCHAR(32),
  	last_name VARCHAR(32),
  	nickname VARCHAR(24),
  	color_eyes VARCHAR(10),
  	color_hair VARCHAR(10),
  	description CLOB
)


Instruction
Let's start off with a data type you already know - int, which is short for integer. As you can expect, this data type stores integer numbers (like 3, 7 or -4).
We use it to count things like chairs, books, legs etc. In our database, INTEGER stores numbers from -217483648 to 217483647.
Our database, and any other database for that matter, has various number types of different ranges. 
INT is the most popular one, but if you need any other range, just check the documentation of your database.

Exercise
Peter wants to have a list of users who paid some money to get a premium account on his dating website. 
Create a simple table premium_account with a single integer column user_id.

Solution
CREATE TABLE premium_account(
	user_id INT
)
