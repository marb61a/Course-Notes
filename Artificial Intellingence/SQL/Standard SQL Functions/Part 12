Instruction
Nice job. As you may expect, it is also possible to use BETWEEN with timestamps:

SELECT id
FROM aircraft
WHERE launched
BETWEEN '2015-11-01' AND '2015-12-01';

Again, we can skip the time â€“ the database will fill in the missing fields with zeroes.
This automatic addition of zeroes is very convenient, but you need to watch out when retrieving rows for the whole month, year etc. 
If you want the aircraft launched in November 2015, you must use the condition we've just shown you:

BETWEEN '2015-11-01' AND '2015-12-01'

The second date is December 1 because the database will add the missing zeroes: 2015-12-01 00:00:00. 
This is the exact point in time when December starts (the beginning of its first day). 
If you wrote the second date as the last day of November (2015-11-30), you would skip all the aircraft which were launched on November 30, 2015.

Exercise
Find all the aircraft which were launched in 2015. Show the columns id and launched.

Solution
select id, launched
from aircraft
where launched
between '2015-01-01' and '2016-01-01'



Instruction
The last thing you should know about timestamps is that you can also sort them with ORDER BY:

SELECT
  id,
  launched
FROM aircraft
ORDER BY launched;

Of course, you can use DESC or ASC after ORDER BY.

Exercise
For all the aircraft launched in 2013 or 2014, show their id and launch date. Sort by the column launched from the newest to the oldest dates.

Solution
select id, launched
from aircraft
where launched
between '2013-01-01' and '2015-01-01'
order by launched desc
