Instruction
It is also quite easy to use dates with logical operators other than the equality sign. Take a look at the following example:

SELECT
  id,
  model,
  produced
FROM aircraft
WHERE produced > '2010-12-31';

In SQL, a date which is "greater than" 2010-12-31 means that you will get all the production dates after that date (i.e., from 2011-01-01 until today). 
Similarly, putting the "less than" sign instead (<) will show older dates.

Exercise
Select the columns id, model, produced for all the aircraft which were produced after December 31, 2012.

Solution
select id, model, produced
from aircraft 
where produced > '2012-12-31'



Instruction
That's it. Of course, you can also use dates with BETWEEN. In this way, you can for instance find production dates in a specific year:

SELECT
  id,
  model,
  produced
FROM aircraft
WHERE produced BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

The above query will find all the aircraft produced between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010, including these dates.

Exercise
Select the id and date of all flights which did NOT take place in 2015.

Solution
select id, date
from flight
where date not between
'2015-01-01' and '2015-12-31'



Instruction
Nice job. You can also sort your rows by date using ORDER BY:

SELECT
  id,
  model,
  produced
FROM aircraft
WHERE produced BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31'
ORDER BY produced;

As usual, you can add ASC or DESC after the ORDER BY clause to set the sorting order.

Solution
select id, date 
from flight
where date between '2015-01-01' and '2015-12-31'
order by date desc


Exercise
For each aircraft produced in 2010, show its id, production date and the distinctive codes of routes they operate on (rename the column to route_code).

Solution
select distinct a.id, a.produced, f.route_code as route_code
from aircraft a
join flight f
on f.aircraft_id = a.id
where a.produced
between '2010-01-01' and '2010-12-31'



Instruction
Good! Apart from dates, our database can also store time. 
At PerfectAir, time columns are used in the table route to indicate the estimated time of departure and arrival in Central European Time.
Let's see how time is represented there.

Exercise
Select the column departure from the table route.

Solution
select departure from route



Instruction
As you can see, the format for this type of data is hh:mm:ss, where hh stands for hours, mm for minutes and ss for seconds. 
This type of column requires apostrophes, just like dates.

SELECT
  code,
  departure
FROM route
WHERE arrival = '14:25:00';

Time requires the use of a 24-hour system (i.e., you should write 14:25 instead of 2:25 PM and 03:10 instead of 3:10 AM etc.). 
You can also use other comparison signs: <, <=, >, >=, !=.

Note: The Oracle database does not support the data type time, even though it is in SQL Standard.

Exercise
Show the code of the route with the scheduled arrival time of 9:30 AM.

Solution
select code 
from route
where arrival = '09:30:00'
