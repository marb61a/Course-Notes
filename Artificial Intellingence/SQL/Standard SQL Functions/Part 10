Instruction
It is also quite easy to use dates with logical operators other than the equality sign. Take a look at the following example:

SELECT
  id,
  model,
  produced
FROM aircraft
WHERE produced > '2010-12-31';

In SQL, a date which is "greater than" 2010-12-31 means that you will get all the production dates after that date (i.e., from 2011-01-01 until today). 
Similarly, putting the "less than" sign instead (<) will show older dates.

Exercise
Select the columns id, model, produced for all the aircraft which were produced after December 31, 2012.

Solution
select id, model, produced
from aircraft 
where produced > '2012-12-31'



Instruction
That's it. Of course, you can also use dates with BETWEEN. In this way, you can for instance find production dates in a specific year:

SELECT
  id,
  model,
  produced
FROM aircraft
WHERE produced BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

The above query will find all the aircraft produced between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010, including these dates.

Exercise
Select the id and date of all flights which did NOT take place in 2015.

Solution
select id, date
from flight
where date not between
'2015-01-01' and '2015-12-31'
