Exercise
Count the number of candidates with preferred_contact set to:

    mobile (mobile_sum).
    e-mail (email_sum).
    mail (mail_sum).
    with NULL (null_sum).

Only count candidates whose score in math and score in language are both greater than or equal to 30.

Solution
select
	sum(
    	case
      		when preferred_contact = 'mobile' then 1
      		else 0
      	end
    ) as mobile_sum,
    sum(
    	case
      		when preferred_contact = 'e-mail' then 1
      		else 0
      	end
    ) as email_sum,
    sum(
    	case
      		when preferred_contact = 'mail' then 1
      		else 0
      	end
    ) as mail_sum,
    sum(
    	case
      		when preferred_contact is null then 1
      		else 0
      	end
    ) as null_sum
from candidate
where score_math > 30
and score_language > 30
