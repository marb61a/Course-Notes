Excellent. An important thing you should know about AVG is that it ignores NULL values. 
Let's say you want to find AVG(price) and you have the following three price values:

    price = 100
    price = 300
    price = NULL

Some people could think that NULL is counted as zero, so the average of these three values would be (100+300+0)/3, which is 400/3. That's not true.
NULLs are not taken into account at all, so you'll get (100+300)/2 = 200 here.

Exercise
Take a look at the three projects of Adriana Fuentes, translator with ID 5. Two of them have a NULL number of words.
Find the average number of words for all the projects of this translator. Name the column average. What do you think the average will be?

Solution
select avg(words) as average
from project
where translator_id = 5


Exercise
Let's calculate the average number of words in all the projects done by translator with id = 5 again.
This time, though, exclude project_id = 13 from the rows so that the only two projects left are the ones with a NULL value. Name column average.

Solution
select avg(words) as average
from project
where translator_id = 5
and project_id != 13



Instruction
Good. Remember: if all arguments are NULL, you will get NULL as the average. Makes sense.
Of course, you can count NULLs as zero, too. Here is how. Remember, the function COALESCE(x,y)? We can use it to replace x with y if x is NULL:

SELECT AVG(COALESCE(price,0))
FROM project;

The above query will find the average price for all projects. If a project has a NULL price, it will indeed be treated as a project with the price 0.

Exercise
Find the average number of words per project translated so far by Adriana Fuentes (translator_id = 5). 
Assume that NULL in column words means that nothing has been translated yet (treat it as words = 0). Name the result average.
