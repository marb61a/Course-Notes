Okay. Finally, we can use ROUND with AVG to get a nicer appearance for our results:

SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM project;

The above query will round the average price to two decimal places. 
Of course, you can also use AVG without the second argument: ROUND(AVG(price)) to get rounding to integer values.

Exercise
For each client in the project table, show the client ID and find the average price for all their projects rounded to integer values. 
Column names should be client_id and rounded_average.

Solution
select client_id,
round(avg(price)) as rounded_average
from project
group by client_id


Exercise
For each translator, show their first and last name together with the average price of all the projects they have completed (as rounded_average). 
Round the price to two decimal places. Count only the projects with the number of words greater than 500. 
Exclude translators who have completed fewer than 2 projects (all completed projects are present in the project table).

Solution
select t.first_name, t.last_name,
round(avg(p.price), 2) as rounded_average
from project p
join translator t
on t.translator_id = p.translator_id
where words > 500
group by t.first_name, t.last_name
having count(p.project_id) > 2



Instruction
Amazing. Another function we'll take a look at is SUM. As you know, SUM finds the sum from all the values. NULL values are ignored: they are not added to the sum.

SELECT SUM(price)
FROM project;

The above query will find the total revenue of the translation agency.
