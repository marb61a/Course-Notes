Exercise
Select all columns from the table copywriter. It's a pretty small table and it contains only 3 columns:

    the copywriter identifier (column id).
    first name of the copywriter (column first_name).
    the last name of the copywriter (column last_name)
    
Solution
select * from copywriter


Exercise
Select all columns from the table slogan.

Each slogan in the table:

    has its identifier (column id).
    corresponds to a certain item (column item_id).
    is designed for a specific medium (column type).
    has its text (column text).
    has the ID of the copywriter (column copywriter_id).

Solution
select * from slogan


Instruction
We need a new operator: || (you can type a single | by pressing ctrl + '\'). 
These two vertical bars are the concatenation operator, i.e., they join two or more text values (or strings, which is another name for text values).
If you write the following:

SELECT first_name || last_name AS name
FROM copywriter;

the result for first_name = 'Kate' and last_name = 'Gordon' will be KateGordon, all of this in a single column. Quite simple, right?

Of course we want the first and the last name separated with a space. Here is how you do it:

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name
FROM copywriter;

Note that you use apostrophes for specific constant text values (a space in our example: ' '), 
but you don't use apostrophes for column names (first_name, last_name). The operator || can be used as many times as you need in a single query.

Exercise
Show each copywriter's first_name and last_name in one column separated with a single space. Name the column name.

Solution
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name
FROM copywriter
