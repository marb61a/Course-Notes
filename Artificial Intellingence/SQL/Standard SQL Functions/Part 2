Exercise
Select all columns from the table copywriter. It's a pretty small table and it contains only 3 columns:

    the copywriter identifier (column id).
    first name of the copywriter (column first_name).
    the last name of the copywriter (column last_name)
    
Solution
select * from copywriter


Exercise
Select all columns from the table slogan.

Each slogan in the table:

    has its identifier (column id).
    corresponds to a certain item (column item_id).
    is designed for a specific medium (column type).
    has its text (column text).
    has the ID of the copywriter (column copywriter_id).

Solution
select * from slogan



Instruction
We need a new operator: || (you can type a single | by pressing ctrl + '\'). 
These two vertical bars are the concatenation operator, i.e., they join two or more text values (or strings, which is another name for text values).
If you write the following:

SELECT first_name || last_name AS name
FROM copywriter;

the result for first_name = 'Kate' and last_name = 'Gordon' will be KateGordon, all of this in a single column. Quite simple, right?

Of course we want the first and the last name separated with a space. Here is how you do it:

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name
FROM copywriter;

Note that you use apostrophes for specific constant text values (a space in our example: ' '), 
but you don't use apostrophes for column names (first_name, last_name). The operator || can be used as many times as you need in a single query.

Exercise
Show each copywriter's first_name and last_name in one column separated with a single space. Name the column name.

Solution
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name
FROM copywriter



Instruction
The concatenation operator is a very useful tool provided by the SQL standard
- There are a few databases that don't comply with the standard in this regard. For example:

    SQL Server and Microsoft Access use the plus sign (+) as the concatenation operator.
    MySQL uses the function CONCAT() like this:

    SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS name
    FROM copywriter;

Now that you've been officially warned, we can go back to || and do one more exercise.

Exercise
For each item, show the following sentence: 'ID X is Y.', where X is the id of the item and Y is its name. Name the column sentence.

Solution
SELECT 'ID '||id||' is '|| name||'.' as sentence
from item


Exercise
For each slogan, show the following sentence (name the column: sentence):

The copywriter of the slogan with ID X is Y Z.

In this sentence, X is the id of the slogan, and Y and Z are the first and last name of the copywriter, respectively.

Solution
select 'The copywriter of the slogan with ID' ||' '||
s.id ||' is'||' '||c.first_name||' '||
c.last_name ||'.' as sentence from slogan s
join copywriter c on s.copywriter_id=c.id


Instruction
Now that we understand the concatenation operator, let's learn some string functions
Our database provides many of these. For instance, there is a function called length(), which shows the length of a string column. For example:

SELECT length(first_name) AS length
FROM copywriter;

will show 4 for the name 'Kate', because 'Kate' consists of 4 letters.

In SQL Server this function is called len().

Exercise
For every slogan, show its id, its text, and its length. Name the last column text_length.

Solution
select id, text, length(text) as text_length
from slogan
