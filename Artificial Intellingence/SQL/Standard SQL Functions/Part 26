Instruction
Great. Okay, one final piece of information: you can also use DISTINCT with MIN or MAX to find the minimum or maximum value, respectively.

SELECT MAX(DISTINCT price)
FROM project;

What is the difference between MAX(price) and MAX(DISTINCT price)? Well, we hate to disappoint you, but there is none. :)
It's just an interesting fact about SQL that you can use DISTINCT with MIN or MAX but it won't change anything.

Exercise
Check it out for yourself. Show four columns:
    the maximum number of words in a project (as max),
    the maximum distinct number of words (as max_distinct),
    the minimum number of words (as min),
    and the minimum distinct number of words (as min_distinct).

Solution
select max(words),
max(distinct words) as max_distinct,
min(words),
min(distinct words) as min_distinct
from project


Exercise
For each translator, show their first and last name, followed by:

    the sum of the prices for all the projects they have completed (as sum).
    the maximum price (as max).
    the minimum price (as min).

Make sure that all translators are shown, and if any of these values turns out to be NULL, show 0 instead.

Solution
select t.first_name, t.last_name,
coalesce(sum(p.price), 0) as sum,
coalesce(max(p.price), 0) as max,
coalesce(min(p.price), 0) as min
from translator t
left join project p
on p.translator_id = t.translator_id
group by t.first_name, t.last_name
