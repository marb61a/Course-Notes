Instruction
Great. Okay, one final piece of information: you can also use DISTINCT with MIN or MAX to find the minimum or maximum value, respectively.

SELECT MAX(DISTINCT price)
FROM project;

What is the difference between MAX(price) and MAX(DISTINCT price)? Well, we hate to disappoint you, but there is none. :)
It's just an interesting fact about SQL that you can use DISTINCT with MIN or MAX but it won't change anything.

Exercise
Check it out for yourself. Show four columns:
    the maximum number of words in a project (as max),
    the maximum distinct number of words (as max_distinct),
    the minimum number of words (as min),
    and the minimum distinct number of words (as min_distinct).

Solution
select max(words),
max(distinct words) as max_distinct,
min(words),
min(distinct words) as min_distinct
from project


Exercise
For each translator, show their first and last name, followed by:

    the sum of the prices for all the projects they have completed (as sum).
    the maximum price (as max).
    the minimum price (as min).

Make sure that all translators are shown, and if any of these values turns out to be NULL, show 0 instead.

Solution
select t.first_name, t.last_name,
coalesce(sum(p.price), 0) as sum,
coalesce(max(p.price), 0) as max,
coalesce(min(p.price), 0) as min
from translator t
left join project p
on p.translator_id = t.translator_id
group by t.first_name, t.last_name



Instruction
OK, it's time to review what we've learned in this part.

    COUNT(*) counts the number of all rows.
    COUNT(column1) counts the number of rows where column1 is not NULL.
    COUNT can be used to count non-NULL expressions.
    Avoid COUNT(*) with LEFT JOINs.
    DISTINCT only takes into account distinct values.
    AVG, SUM, MAX and MIN ignore NULLs, but COUNT takes them into account when counting the number of rows.
    You can use COALESCE(x,y) to replace x with y when x is NULL. For example, you can replace NULLs with 0.
    You can use AVG, SUM, MIN or MAX with DISTINCT.
    You can use ROUND to round the score obtained with AVG.

All right! Are you ready for some practice?

Solution
None in this case !!!


Exercise
Count the number of all projects, the number of clients that have commissioned at least one project 
(that is, count them once even if they commissioned more than one project) and the average price for all the projects.
Name the columns: projects_no, clients_no, and average_price.

Solution
select count(project_id) as projects_no,
count(distinct client_id) as clients_no,
avg(price) as average_price
from project


Exercise
For each translator, show:

    their first and last name.
    the number of projects they have completed (as projects_no).
    the highest number of words among their projects (as max_words).
    the average price among their projects rounded to integer values (as rounded_avg_price).

Solution
select t.first_name, t.last_name,
count(p.project_id) as projects_no,
max(words) as max_words,
round(avg(price)) as rounded_avg_price
from translator t
left join project p
on p.translator_id = t.translator_id
group by t.first_name, t.last_name


Exercise
For each language combination in table project (e.g. EN to ES, ES to EN, DE to PL etc.) show lang_from, 
lang_to and the average price in this combination (as avg_price). 
When calculating the average, treat NULL values as 0.

Solution
// Be careful with brackets when swapping avg and coalesce
select p.lang_from, p.lang_to,
avg(coalesce(price, 0)) as avg_price
from project p
group by p.lang_from, p.lang_to
