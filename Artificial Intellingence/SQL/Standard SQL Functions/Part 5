Exercise
For each slogan with a text longer than 20 characters, show the text fragment from character 5 until character 20. Name the column text_substring.

Solution
select
substring(text, 5, 16) as text_substring
from slogan 
where length(text) > 20


Exercise
For each 'tv commercial' slogan, show the item name, the item type, and the text with each period (.) 
turned into three exclamation marks (!!!) – name this column changed_text.

Solution
select i.name, i.type, 
replace(s.text, '.', '!!!') as changed_text
from slogan s
join item i
on i.id = s.item_id 
where s.type = 'tv commercial'



Instruction
Let's introduce the table we'll use in this part of the course. If you're one of those people who love MMORPG games, you'll love the table too.

The table name is character and it stores information about heroes in an online RPG game.
A single user can have more than one character. Let's see what the table contains in detail.

Exercise
Select all the columns for the table character.
Each character has its unique id and the id of the user it belongs to. 
The character is at a certain level, belongs to a certain class (wizard or warrior) and has a certain amount of money (account_balance).

There are also hp (health points) and mp (mana points), as well as the basic statistics – strength and wisdom.
Due to various curses and blessings, the statistics can be affected by the stat_modifier, which can be positive or negative.

Finally, there is the height and weight of each character, expressed in meters and kilograms respectively.

Solution
select * from character



Instruction
Before we continue, let's review what we know about numbers already.
Integer numbers are expressed in the normal, intuitive way: 1, 2, 43, -27 etc.
Fractions are expressed with a period (.): 12.45, -401.238, etc. 
Please note that in some languages you use a comma instead of a period, but you cannot do that in SQL (12,45 is incorrect)!
In SQL (and in most programming languages) there are three kinds of number types:

    Integer type – they store integers but not fractions.
    Floating point numbers – they store fractions in binary format.
    Decimal numbers – they store fractions in decimal format.

In this part we'll discuss some of the differences between various numeric data types in SQL.
Of course, you can use the four basic mathematical operations: +, -, *, / with numbers in SQL. 
You can also use columns and constant numbers together, for instance:

SELECT hp / 100
FROM character;

Solution
select name, level, (hp + mp) 
as sum
from character
group by level, name, sum



Instruction
You can also join numbers and text values using the concatenation symbol ||. Take a look:

SELECT 'Your character is at level ' || level AS sentence
FROM character;

Exercise
For each character above the first level (level > 1), show the following text:

The account balance for {name} is {money}.

{name} is the name of the character and {money} is the current account_balance. Name the column sentence. 

Solution
select 'The account balance for '|| name ||' is '|| account_balance ||'.'
as sentence
from character
where level > 1


Exercise
For a character Mnah (name = 'Mnah'), select name, weight, height 
and the result of the following calculation: weight - height - weight + height (name the last column result). It should equal 0, right?

Solution
select name, weight, height,
(weight - height - weight + height) as result 
from character
where name = 'Mnah'
