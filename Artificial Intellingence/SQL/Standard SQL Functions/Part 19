Instruction
Nice! You can also use COALESCE with other functions: concatenation, multiplication etc. Take a look:

COALESCE(category, '') || ':' || COALESCE(type, '')

In the above fragment, a NULL category or type will be replaced by an empty string. 
Thanks to this, we can still see the type when the category is NULL and vice versa.

Exercise
Show the following sentence: Product X is made in Y. Where X is the name and Y is the production_area. 
If the name is not provided, write 'unknown name' instead. 
If the production_area is not provided, write 'unknown area'. Name the column sentence.

Solution
select 'Product'||' '||
coalesce(name, 'unknown name')
||' '||'is'||' '||'made'||' '||'in'||' '||
coalesce(production_area, 'unknown area')
||'.'
as sentence
from product



Instruction
Good. You can also use COALESCE in calculations in a similar way:

COALESCE(price, 0) * 1.05

The above query will return the price times 1.05 or 0 (0 * 1.05 = 0) if the price is NULL.

Exercise
The company organized a discount campaign on all prices: -10%.
Show the names of all products together with their price and the new prices (name the column new_price). 
If there is no price, show 0.0 in the column new_price. Round the result to two decimal points.

Solution
select name, price,
round((coalesce(price, 0.0) * 0.9), 2) as new_price
from product
