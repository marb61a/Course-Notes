Exercise
For each candidate, with at least one application, show their id and three more columns called count_accepted, count_rejected, count_pending. 
Each of these columns should count the number of times the candidate has been accepted to courses, rejected or where the decision is pending.
Sort the rows in ASCending order by the id.

Solution
select
	candidate_id as id,
    sum(
	  case
      	when status = 'accepted' then 1
        else 0
      end
    ) as count_accepted,
    sum(
      case
        when status = 'rejected' then 1
        else 0
      end
    ) as count_rejected,
    sum(
      case
        when status = 'pending' then 1
        else 0
      end
    ) as count_pending
from application
group by candidate_id
order by candidate_id


Exercise
For each degree course, show its ID (as id) and the number of distinct candidates who applied for this course and have the preferred_contact set to:

    mobile (column: count_mobile),
    mail (column: count_mail)

Solution
select
	co.id,
    count(
      distinct
      case
        when preferred_contact = 'mobile' then candidate_id
      end
    ) as count_mobile,
    count(
      distinct
      case
        when preferred_contact = 'mail' then candidate_id
      end
    ) as count_mail
from application a
join candidate c
on c.id = a.candidate_id
join course co
on co.id = a.course_id
group by co.id
