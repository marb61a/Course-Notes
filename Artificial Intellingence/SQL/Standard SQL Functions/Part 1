Instruction
We'll use two simple tables which come from an art gallery
On the right side of the screen, there is a button named Database â€“ click on it to study the structure of the tables.
The table artist includes:
    the identifier (column id).
    first and last name (columns first_name, last_name).
    the exact dates when the artist was born and when they died (columns born, died).
    and their nationality (column nationality).

The table painting includes:
    the painting id (column id).
    the id of the artist (column artist_id).
    its title (column title).
    the year it was created (column painted).
    and the quality rating of the painting by some local experts (column rating).
