Exercise
Each warrior (class = 'warrior') at level 3 or higher can perform a special attack whose damage is calculated as follows: 
its strength plus one fourth of its hp, and then multiplied by the absolute value of stat_modifier. Round this column to 2 decimal places.

Show the name and special attack damage (column damage) calculated for those characters which have the attack available.

Solution
select name,
round((strength+0.25*hp)*abs(stat_modifier), 2)
as damage
from character
where level >= 3
and class='warrior'


Exercise
For players with IDs equal to 1 and 5, show firstname and lastname together with the level, height rounded to two decimal places, and account_balance rounded down. 
The column names should be: firstname, lastname, level, height, and account_balance.

Solution
select p.firstname, p.lastname,
c.level, 
round(cast(c.height as decimal), 2) as height, 
floor(c.account_balance) as account_balance
from character c
join player p
on p.id = c.player_id
where p.id in(1, 5)



Instruction
Let's introduce the tables we're going to work with. A European airline called PerfectAir provided some of its data to us. 
Let's see what we have received from them.

Exercise
Select all the information for the table route.
The table route keeps track of the destinations offered by PerfectAir. Each route has:

    an ID code used for identification.
    the international code of the departure airport (from_airport).
    the international code of the arrival airport (to_airport).
    total distance of the route (distance) expressed in kilometers.
    departure which stores the scheduled time of departure.
    arrival containing information about planned time of arrival.

Keep in mind that both of the time values are shown in Central European Time.
