Instruction
Correct again. When we write COUNT(project_id), we actually mean COUNT(ALL project_id), including all non-NULL values. 
If a value is duplicated, then each duplicate is counted separately.
We can also use the keyword DISTINCT to remove duplicates.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT client_id)
FROM project;

The above query will count the number of clients that have commissioned at least one project from the table project.
Note that we had to include the keyword DISTINCT â€“ if we hadn't, we would've got the number of all projects where client_id was not NULL.

Exercise
Count the number of translators that did translate at least one project. Name the column translator_no

Solution
select count(distinct translator_id) 
as translator_no 
from project 


Exercise
Count how many distinct rates per word our translation agency uses. 
To obtain the rate for one word, divide the price by number of words. Name the column rates.
Make sure not to use integer division.

Solution
select count(distinct(cast(price as numeric) / words))  
as rates
from project



Instruction
It worked, didn't it? Good job.
Usually, COUNT is used together with GROUP BY. Do you remember how GROUP BY works? 
It groups together all the rows which share a common value in the column which we specified. 
We apply GROUP BY to obtain some statistics for entire groups of rows, like the number of items in these groups:

SELECT
  translator_id,
  COUNT(project_id)
FROM project
GROUP BY translator_id;

The above query will group the projects carried out by specific translators and will provide the number of projects completed by each translator.

Exercise
Show each client's id together with the number of projects they have commissioned. Name the second column projects_no.

Solution
select client_id,
count(project_id) as projects_no
from project
group by client_id


Exercise
For each project, show the client_id and the number of projects commissioned by that specific client which have some feedback
(zero if there are no such projects). Name the second column projects_no

Solution
select client_id,
count(feedback) as projects_no
from project
group by client_id



Instruction
That's right! The keyword DISTINCT can, of course, be used in queries that apply GROUP BY. Take a look:

SELECT
  client_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT translator_id)
FROM project
GROUP BY client_id;

The above query will show each client together with the number of translators who have ever worked on at least one project for that client.

Exercise
select translator_id, 
count(distinct client_id) as clients_no
from project
group by translator_id


Exercise
The rate per word is the price divided by the number of words. 
Show translator id together with number of distinct rates per word he used in his projects.
Name the second column rates_no.

Solution
select translator_id,
count(distinct(cast(price as numeric)/words))
as rates_no
from project
group by translator_id
