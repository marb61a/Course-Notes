Instruction
Remember that you don't have to use length() in the SELECT clause. 
You can use it after WHERE too! By doing so, you can filter columns that have longer or shorter values, for instance.

SELECT
  id,
  text
FROM slogan
WHERE length(text) < 20;

The above query will select only those slogans whose length is shorter than 20 characters.

Exercise
Show the IDs of all the items with a name longer than 8 characters. Show the length as the second column, name it name_length.

Solution
select id, length(name) as name_length
from item 
where length(name) > 8 



Instruction
There are other functions you should learn too. One of them is lower().
Whatever is put inside the parentheses of lower() will be written in lowercase letters. For example:

SELECT lower(last_name) AS last_name_lowercase
FROM copywriter;

will produce 'turner' for the last name 'Turner'. Shall we try it in an exercise?

Exercise
The boss of the marketing agency heard that it's now very fashionable to write magazine and newspaper ads in lowercase letters. Let's check how it would look.
For every slogan of the type 'newspaper ad' or 'magazine ad', show the slogan id and its text in lowercase as text_lowercase.

Solution
select id, lower(text) as text_lowercase
from slogan 
where type = 'newspaper ad' or type = 'magazine ad'



Instruction
If there is a function for lowercase letters, there must be a function for uppercase letters too, right? It's called upper() and works in a similar way:

Exercise
SELECT upper(last_name) AS last_name_uppercase
FROM copywriter;

The above query will show 'TURNER' for the last name 'Turner'.

The lowercase fashion is now pass√©. Everybody started to use upper case.
Show the id of each 'newspaper ad' or 'magazine ad' slogan together with its text in capital letters. Name the second column text_uppercase.

Solution
select id, upper(text) as text_uppercase
from slogan 
where type = 'newspaper ad' or type = 'magazine ad'


Instruction
Yet another function is initcap(), which will change the first letter of a text value to upper case and the rest to lower case.
For instance, if someone mistakenly inserted another lastname with caps lock as 'sMITH', the query:

SELECT initcap(last_name) AS last_name_initcap
FROM copywriter;

will show 'Smith' for that last name. That's often a convenient way to show all names in the proper way.

The initcap() is only present in PostgreSQL and Oracle. It does not exist in MySQL and SQL Server.

Exercise
The boss wants you to update the names of all the items so that they start with a capital letter, followed by lowercase. 
Show the id of each item together with its old name (as old_name) and updated name (as new_name).

Solution
/// Temp Solution
select id, name as old_name,
initcap(name)as new_name
from item
