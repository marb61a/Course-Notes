Instruction
Remember that you don't have to use length() in the SELECT clause. 
You can use it after WHERE too! By doing so, you can filter columns that have longer or shorter values, for instance.

SELECT
  id,
  text
FROM slogan
WHERE length(text) < 20;

The above query will select only those slogans whose length is shorter than 20 characters.

Exercise
Show the IDs of all the items with a name longer than 8 characters. Show the length as the second column, name it name_length.

Solution
select id, length(name) as name_length
from item 
where length(name) > 8 



Instruction
There are other functions you should learn too. One of them is lower().
Whatever is put inside the parentheses of lower() will be written in lowercase letters. For example:

SELECT lower(last_name) AS last_name_lowercase
FROM copywriter;

will produce 'turner' for the last name 'Turner'. Shall we try it in an exercise?

Exercise
The boss of the marketing agency heard that it's now very fashionable to write magazine and newspaper ads in lowercase letters. Let's check how it would look.
For every slogan of the type 'newspaper ad' or 'magazine ad', show the slogan id and its text in lowercase as text_lowercase.

Solution
select id, lower(text) as text_lowercase
from slogan 
where type = 'newspaper ad' or type = 'magazine ad'
