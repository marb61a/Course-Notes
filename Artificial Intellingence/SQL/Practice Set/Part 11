Exercise
Select all data from the museum_loan table.
It consists of the following columns:
    from_museum_id – the ID of the museum that loaned a given piece of art to another museum,
    to_museum_id – the ID of a museum that received a given piece of art from a given museum,
    piece_id – the ID of a given piece of art that was loaned,
    period – the duration of a loan,
    year – the year when the loan started,
    exchange – a boolean column that indicates whether a given loan was a part of an exchange for another piece of art or not.

Solution
SELECT * FROM museum_loan


Exercise
For each piece of art that is housed in either an American (USA) or Italian (Italy) museum, 
show both its name (as piece_name) and the name of its artist (as artist_name).

Solution
SELECT 
	p.name AS piece_name,
    a.name AS artist_name
FROM museum m
JOIN piece_of_art p
ON p.museum_id = m.id
JOIN artist a 
ON a.id = p.artist_id
WHERE m.country IN ('USA', 'Italy')


Exercise
Show the name of each museum and the number of pieces of art it has in its collection (rename the column piece_count).

Solution
SELECT 
	m.name,
    COUNT(p.id) AS piece_count
FROM museum m
JOIN piece_of_art p
ON p.museum_id = m.id
GROUP BY m.name


Exercise
Show the name of each museum and the number of pieces of art it has (name this column piece_count). 
However, consider only those pieces of art that are located in museums from the same country as their creators' birthplace 
and for which the number of counted pieces of art is greater than 0.
