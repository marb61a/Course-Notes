Instruction
We'll focus on the sales of a Japanese 100 Yen store. It's a store where you can buy cheap products.
Obviously, our database doesn't contain every transaction, client, or product. For our purposes, we'll look at a small sample.

Exercise
Select all data from the categories table. It stores the names of product categories:

    id – the id of a given category,
    name – the name of a given category.

Solution

Exercise
Select all data from the products table. It consists of the following four columns:

    id – the id of a given product,
    name – the name of a given product,
    category_id – the id of the category that a given product belongs to,
    price – the yen value of a given product.

Solution
select * from products


Exercise
Select the name of each category and the number of products it has. Show zero for categories which have no products.

Solution
select 
	c.name,
    count(p.category_id)
from products as p
right join categories as c
on c.id = p.category_id
group by c.name


Exercise
Select all data from the clients table. As you can see, it consists of the following columns:

    id – the id of a given client,
    first_name – the first name of a given client,
    last_name – the last name of a given client.

Exercise
Select all data from the orders table. It consists of the following three columns:

    id – the id of a given order,
    client_id – the id of the client who placed a given order,
    year – the year a given order was placed.


Solution
select * from orders


Exercise
Show the first and last name of each client and the number of orders they placed. Rename the third column to order_count.
Remember to include in the query the clients who haven't ordered anything yet.

Solution
select
	c.first_name, 
    c.last_name, 
    count(o.id) as order_count
from clients as c
left join orders as o
on c.id = o.client_id
group by c.first_name, c.last_name


Exercise
Select all data from the order_items table.
This is an associative table – it connects data from two tables: orders and products. That's how we know what items form an order.
It consists of the following columns:

    order_id – the id of the order a given product is part of,
    product_id – the id of the product itself,
    quantity – the quantity of the product in this order,
    price – the total price for the product in this order.


Solution
select * from order_items


Exercise
Select the names of all products that were part of the order with the id of 13.

Solution
select 
	p.name
from products as p
join order_items as o
on o.product_id = p.id
where o.order_id = 13
group by 1
