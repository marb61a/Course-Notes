Exercise
Select all data from the order_items table.

This is an associative table – it connects data from two tables: orders and products. That's how we know what items form an order.

It consists of the following columns:

    order_id – the id of the order a given product is part of,
    product_id – the id of the product itself,
    quantity – the quantity of the product in this order,
    price – the total price for the product in this order.

Solution
select * from order_items


Exercise
Select the names of all products that were part of the order with the id of 13.

Solution
select p.name
from products as p
join order_items as o
on o.product_id = p.id
where o.order_id = 13
group by 1


Exercise
For each order select its ID (name the column order_id), the first and last name of the client who made this order,
and the total revenue generated by this order (name the column revenue).

Note: The revenue for the order is the sum of the price column for each item in the order. 

Solution
select o.id as order_id,
c.first_name, c.last_name,
sum(oi.price) as revenue
from orders as o
join clients as c
on o.client_id = c.id
join order_items as oi 
on o.id = oi.order_id
group by o.id, c.first_name,
c.last_name
