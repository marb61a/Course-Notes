Before we can start querying, we first have to get to know our newest set of tables. Let's start with the smallest one, the orchestras table. 
Note that the data in these tables are imaginary and any resemblance to real names of musicians and orchestras is purely coincidental! 

Exercise
Select all data from the orchestras table. As you can see, it consists of the following columns:

    id – the id of the orchestra,
    name – the name of the orchestra,
    rating – the rating of the orchestra over the last ten years,
    city_origin – the city from which the orchestra originates.
    country_origin – the country of origin of the orchestra,
    year – year in which the orchestra was created.

Solution
SELECT * FROM orchestras

    country – the name of the country where the concert took place,
    year – the year in which the concert was performed,
    rating – the rating (by critics) of the concert,
    orchestra_id – the id of the orchestra that performed at the concert.

and consists of the following columns:

    id – the id of a given member,
    name – the name of a given member,
    position – the position of a given member in an orchestra,
