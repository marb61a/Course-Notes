Instruction
Now we will focus on aggregation and grouping. However, we'll start with a quick recap.
SQL offers aggregate functions that can help with computing statistics: count(), sum(), min(), max(), avg(), etc.
In order to create more sophisticated statistics with aggregate functions, you have to use the GROUP BY clause. 
This groups together all rows that have the same values.
You can use the HAVING clause, if you need to filter the result of an aggregate function.
Take a look at the example below. This query selects every client_id and the average value of all items a given client ordered. 
It takes into consideration only those clients who ordered at least twice.

SELECT 
  client_id,
  avg(order_price)
FROM client_orders
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING count(client_id) >= 2

The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicate results.
In order to sort table rows, you need to use the ORDER BY clause. For example:

SELECT 
  client_id,
  name
FROM client_orders
ORDER BY name DESC
