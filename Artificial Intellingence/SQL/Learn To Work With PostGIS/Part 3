Instruction
Before we call it a day, we'd like to present you with a couple theoretical questions to answer in a short quiz. Let's get started!

    Spatial databases are optimized to store and query geometric data.
    Points, linestrings, and polygons are basic geometric objects that can be found in spatial databases.
    Spatial database also goes under the following names: geodatabase, geospatial database, geographical database.
    PostGIS is the spatial extension for PostgresSQL that enables spatial data management.
    Even though there are a few spatial databases other than PostGIS, all the popular ones follow the standard set out by Open Geospatial Consortium.
    There are two main types of spatial columns: geometry and geography. The first one is quicker, the latter is more accurate.
    The data in geometry columns are stored in the internal PostGIS format. We can convert this data to a few text output formats: 
    Well-Known Text (WKT), Well-Known Binary (WKB), Geographic Mark-up Language (GML), etc.

Exercise
Answer following questions â€“ fill the template with trues and falses.

    PostGIS is a spatial extension for PostgreSQL. True or false?
    PostgreSQL stores points as Well-Known Text. True or false?
    The function ST_AsText is used to convert a numerical column into a column with text. True or false?

Solution
SELECT
  -- first question (type true or false)
  TRUE AS first_question,
  -- second question (type true or false)
  FALSE AS second_question,
  -- third question (type true or false)
  FALSE AS third_question;
  

Instruction
If you have already taken some of our courses, you may have noticed that we usually introduce two or three simple tables in each part of a given course.
In this PostGIS course, things will be a bit different. We'll use the same set of roughly ten tables throughout all parts. 
Most of the tables will have something to do with the beautiful city of San Francisco, California, 
as Mark decided to settle there after his little trip around the world. You'll be tasked with helping him get to know the city through and through!
We'll be analyzing various hotels, bicycle routes, tram stops and other things that you'll typically find in any bigger city. 
The geographic data will all be real information for San Francisco.

    The geographic data in the tables sf_atms, sf_selected_railways, sf_tram_stops, sf_hotels, sf_bicycle_routes, sf_restaurants,
    sf_sights, usa_states, sf_chains were taken from OpenStreetMap.
    The geographic data in the table sf_planning_districts was taken from data.sfgov.org.
    The geographic data in the table sf_household_types were retrieved by the Census Bureau Data API.

You can download the dataset used in this course here.
If you know San Francisco, you'll also see other kinds of things you may not recognize, like hotel names and bicycle route conditions. 
We have to admit, those are totally made up!
Does all of that sound complex to you? Don't worry! We'll introduce the new tables gradually so you can get familiar and comfortable with our data as we progress.
