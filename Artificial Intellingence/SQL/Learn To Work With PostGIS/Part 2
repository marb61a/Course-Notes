Instruction
Naturally, there are many spatial databases out there, and we can't show them all. For the purposes of this course, we'll use PostgreSQL and PostGIS.
PostgreSQL is a well-known database management system (DBMS), usually ranked in the top 5 DBMS in terms of popularity. 
We've chosen this particular DBMS because of its high level of compliance with the SQL standard, among other things.
PostgreSQL does not support spatial data management. That's where PostGIS has the floor - it is an extension that turns PostgreSQL into a spatial database. 
As we've already mentioned, PostgreSQL and PostGIS are not the only options for those interested in spatial databases. 
Other possibilities include Oracle with its Oracle Spatial feature, Microsoft SQL Server since version 2008, or MySQL since version 5.0.16.
Note that if you ever end up working with another spatial database, you'll have to devote some time to transitioning from PostGIS. 
You may have to check new spatial function names, as they may differ from those available in PostGIS.
Still, the concept and the core features should remain the same regardless of the specific DBMS you use. 
That's because all of the popular DBMS implement Simple Features - a standard set that has been established by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

Exercise
Answer following questions â€“ fill the template with trues and falses.
    Both PostgreSQL and PostGIS are spatial databases, but PostGIS has better optimization. True or false?
    PostgreSQL with PostGIS is currently the only spatial database available. True or false?
    Identify all spatial databases among the following:
        Microsoft Excel
        Microsoft SQL Server 2008 or higher
        PostgreSQL with PostGIS
        Google Drive

Solution
SELECT
  -- first question (type true or false)
  FALSE AS first_question,
  -- second question (type true or flase)
  FALSE AS second_question,
  -- third question (type true for correct answers and false for incorrect answers)
    FALSE AS microsoft_excel,
    TRUE AS microsoft_sql_server_2008_or_higher,
    TRUE AS postgresql_with_postgis,
    FALSE AS google_drive;
    

Instruction
There are two types of spatial columns that we'll discuss in this course: geometry and geography. 
We'll explain the difference between these two types later. 
For now, keep in mind that both of these types can be used to do similar things, but geometry is quicker, and geography is more accurate. 
For the vast majority of this course, we'll focus on geometry. 
In PostgreSQL/PostGIS, there are no specific column types for points, lines or polygons. 
Instead, they're all stored in a single column type called geometry.
Inside PostgreSQL, in turn, these geometry columns are stored in an internal format which is only understood by PostGIS and looks like: 3F545952C0CBDE2613B7C84...
Fortunately, PostGIS makes it possible to convert its own internal format to something we can actually make use of. 
There are quite a few text output formats, such as Well-Known Text (WKT), Well-Known Binary (WKB), Geographic Mark-up Language (GML), GeoJSON and others.
