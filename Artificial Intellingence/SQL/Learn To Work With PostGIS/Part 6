Instruction
The next function we'll get to know is ST_Npoints. It returns the number of points in a given linestring. 

SELECT 
  id,
  ST_Npoints(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

The query above will show the number of points in each railway and order them in descending order, from greatest to least number of points.

Exercise
You are also able to put spatial functions in other places, such as the WHERE clause.
Show the total number of bicycle routes in sf_bicycle_routes that have more than 100 points.

Solution
SELECT
	COUNT(ST_NPoints(course))
FROM sf_bicycle_routes
WHERE ST_NPoints(course) > 100


Instruction
The most interesting function intended for linestrings maybe the following: ST_Length. It returns the length of the given linestring:

SELECT 
  ST_Length(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways
WHERE id = 1;

Now, you may be wondering: what is the unit of length that ST_Length uses? Well, the answer is not that simple. Let's check this out.

Exercise
Run the template code

Solution
SELECT 
  ST_Length(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways 
WHERE id = 1


Instruction
Notice that the answer we got in the previous exercise was well below 1.
The unit? was not Kilometers? Miles?  By default, it is given in degrees.
In order to understand why, go back to what we said at the beginning of our course: the Earth is a sphere. 
It's round, so it can't be ideally projected onto a 2D map. 
That's why the geometry type does not give exact results when calculating lengths of linestrings in meters or miles. 
In order to even come close to the real result, the geometry type needs a couple pieces of information, 
such as the type of map projection, the part of the world for which we are performing calculations, and the unit of measure we want to use.
It would be very time-consuming to provide all this necessary information each time we intend to run the function. 
That is why PostGIS has thousands of ready-made sets of information available. 
	- To use this you will need to provide the so-called Spatial Reference Identifier, or SRID
	- This is different depending on what region of the Earth you are looking at.
How can you find the right SRID? There are many site on which it can be found:
    Spatial Reference Website: visit the EPSG tab at http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/.
    EPSG.io: simply type the name of the country, a code, or the name of a coordinate system to run the search and get all the possible coordinate reference systems.
    EPSG-registry.org: offers many options for checking various coordinate systems, either by name or by code, etc.


Exercise
Press next exercise to continue

Solution
No solution needed


Instrucion
Go to the Spatial Reference website at --> http://spatialreference.org/
Firstly click on the EPSG link, then type in whatever code is being searched for
After this then click on the link that is the result and then click on the well known text as html
This then is where information about a SRID can be checked

Exercise
Examine the template, there is a a different SRID for each use of the ST_Transform function
The results do differ but only slightly, if necessary the SRID's can be checked on the websites above

Solution
// Already provided
SELECT
  ST_Length(ST_Transform(course, 26910)),
  ST_Length(ST_Transform(course, 3310)),
  ST_Length(ST_Transform(course, 3493))
FROM sf_bicycle_routes
WHERE id = 1
