The next function we'll get to know is ST_Npoints. It returns the number of points in a given linestring. Take a look at how it's used:

SELECT 
  id,
  ST_Npoints(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

The query above will show the number of points in each railway and order them in descending order, from greatest to least number of points.

Exercise
So far, we've only used spatial functions in the SELECT clause, but that's not the only option. You can also put them in other places, such as the WHERE clause.
Show the total number of bicycle routes in sf_bicycle_routes that have more than 100 points.

Solution
SELECT
	COUNT(ST_NPoints(course))
FROM sf_bicycle_routes
WHERE ST_NPoints(course) > 100


Instruction
Now comes arguably the most interesting function intended for linestrings: ST_Length. As you may expect, it returns the length of the given linestring:

SELECT 
  ST_Length(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways
WHERE id = 1;

Now, you may be wondering: what is the unit of length that ST_Length uses? Well, the answer is not that simple. Let's check this out.

Exercise
Run the template code

Solution
SELECT 
  ST_Length(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways 
WHERE id = 1
