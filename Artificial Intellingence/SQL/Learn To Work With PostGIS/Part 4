Instruction
Let's start discussing subtypes of the geometry type. The first types we're going to deal with are points. Each point represents one location on Earth. 
There are two tables with points in our database, so let's get to know them.

Exercise
Select all the information from the table sf_tram_stops.
As you may recall, there are three columns in this table:

    id - the unique identifier of each tram stop,
    coordinates - the location of the tram given as a geometry column,
    transfer_possible - either true or false; this column indicates whether a passenger can change to other trams at this stop.

Check the map. Notice how stops typically come in pairs, one stop for travel in each direction.

Solution
SELECT * FROM sf_tram_stops


Exercise
Select all the information from the table sf_atms.
Each ATM has:

    a unique identifier (id),
    coordinates (a geometry column),
    the company it belongs to (company),
    a true/false flag which indicating whether it accepts foreign credit cards (international).

Solution
SELECT * FROM sf_atms


Instruction
These are our tables with points. As we already know we can change the format in which they are stored in the database to Well-Known Text using the following query:

SELECT 
  ST_AsText(coordinates) 
FROM sf_tram_stops;

The query above will show the coordinates of each tram stop in a form that we can easily read and interpret.

Exercise
Display the coordinates column of the ATM whose id is equal to 1 from the sf_atms table in a human-readable format (Well-Known Text).
The answer you get starts with the word POINT (which tells us that the geometry is a point). 
It is followed by parentheses, within which you will find the X and Y coordinates of the point

Solution
SELECT 
  ST_AsText(coordinates) 
FROM sf_atms
WHERE id = 1
