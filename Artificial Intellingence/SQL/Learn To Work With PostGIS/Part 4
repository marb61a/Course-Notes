Instruction
The first geometry sub-types to be dealt with are points. Each point represents one location on Earth. 
There are two tables with points in our database, so let's get to know them.

Exercise
Select all the information from the table sf_tram_stops.
In this table there are three columns in this table:

    id - the unique identifier of each tram stop,
    coordinates - the location of the tram given as a geometry column,
    transfer_possible - either true or false; this column indicates whether a passenger can change to other trams at this stop.

When the accompanying map is looked at it shows how stops typically come in pairs, one stop for travel in each direction.

Solution
SELECT * FROM sf_tram_stops


Exercise
Select all the information from the table sf_atms.
Each ATM has:

    a unique identifier (id),
    coordinates (a geometry column),
    the company it belongs to (company),
    a true/false flag which indicating whether it accepts foreign credit cards (international).

Solution
SELECT * FROM sf_atms


Instruction
There is the ability to change the format in which points are stored in the database to Well-Known Text
    - It can be done using the following example query
SELECT 
  ST_AsText(coordinates) 
FROM sf_tram_stops;

The query above will show the coordinates of each tram stop in a form that is easy to read and interpret.

Exercise
Display the coordinates column of the ATM whose id is equal to 1 from the sf_atms table in a human-readable format (Well-Known Text).
The answer you get starts with the word POINT (which tells us that the geometry is a point). 
It is followed by parentheses, within which you will find the X and Y coordinates of the point

Solution
SELECT 
  ST_AsText(coordinates) 
FROM sf_atms
WHERE id = 1



Instruction
Before continuing take a close look at the result from the previous exercise:

POINT(37.4689849135265 -122.432973622832)

Inside the parentheses, we have the coordinates of our point. But how exactly to interpret the numbers? 
    - These are GPS Coordinates representing latitude and longitude, respectively. 
    - They are representative of the global address of any place on Earth.
    - Lines of latitude run east-west and are parallel to the equator. 
    - Lines of longitude run north-south and are parallel to a line from the North Pole to the South Pole that runs through Greenwich in London 
        (known as the Greenwich Meridian, or the Prime Meridian). 
    - Given both the latitude and longitude of any point on Earth, you can find its accurate location.
    - The X coordinate is the latitude, and the Y coordinate is the longitude.
    - The convention when using GPS coordinates is that they are usually provided in the reverse order: longitude first and latitude second. 
    - In PostGIS X = longitude and Y = latitude. Pay special attention to this fact when you read or save points.

Solution
No solution needed



Instruction
A point represents a single location on Earth. It has a shape and length of 0 which has advantages and disadvantages. 
    - On one hand, points take up very little space in spatial databases. Calculations performed with points are also quick. 
    - On the other hand, we can't precisely define the shapes of objects represented with points. 
They are therefore suitable representations of simple objects
    - The shape of these objects does not matter to us whether thay are post boxes or road signs.
It is worth getting to know two functions that can be used to work with points: ST_X(geometry) and ST_Y(geometry). 
    - These functions return the X and Y coordinates, respectively, of a point.

SELECT 
  ST_X(coordinates) 
FROM sf_atms;

The above query will return the X coordinates (longitudes) of all ATMs in San Francisco.

Exercise
For each tram stop with possible changes to other lines, show the coordinates as WKT, then the latitude, and then the longitude.

Solution
SELECT 
  ST_AsText(coordinates),
  ST_Y(coordinates),
  ST_X(coordinates)
FROM sf_tram_stops
WHERE transfer_possible=TRUE
