Exercise
Mark decided to take a few bicycle trips over the weekend. 
  - However, he hasn't ridden a bike in a long time, so he doesn't want to overwork himself. 
  - Display only the length and id of the bicycle routes that are longer than 1000 meters but shorter than 5000 meters. Sort them in ascending order.
  
Solution
SELECT
	id,
    ST_Length(ST_Transform(course, 26910))
FROM sf_bicycle_routes
WHERE ST_Length(ST_Transform(course, 26910))
BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000
ORDER BY 2


Instruction
Each geometry has a default SRID stored inside the same geometry column. 
  - In order to find out what that default SRID is, you can use the function ST_SRID(geometry) as shown below

SELECT
  ST_SRID(course) 
FROM sf_selected_railways 
WHERE id = 1;

Exercise
There is a template query provided and which can be run
  - You will find out what the default SRID is for our data, and how it differs from the SRID we used to retrive the distance in meters.
  - The default SRID is 4326 in this example, also known as WGS84. 
  - The main difference from the system with SRID 26910 is that WGS84 uses degrees as the length unit. 
  - That's why the resulting length of 0.002 was so different from the roughly 217 meters we got - it is a completely different measure!

Solution
// Solution already provided
SELECT
  ST_SRID(course) AS default_srid, 
  ST_Length(course) length_default_srid,
  ST_SRID(ST_Transform(course,26910)) AS srid_26910,
  ST_Length(ST_Transform(course,26910)) AS length_srid_26910 
FROM sf_selected_railways 
WHERE id = 1
