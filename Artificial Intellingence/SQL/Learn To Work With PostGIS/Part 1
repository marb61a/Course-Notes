Before moving on, let's get to know the table we'll use in the quiz. The entire course is about geography, and so is the quiz table! 
Here's the first task: select all the information from the table travel_spending. You can always view all the tables in the Database tab on the right.
Done? Now, let's talk about the table in detail. A traveler named Mark decided to keep track of his spendings on each day of his trip throughout Asia. 
You can view the unique id of each day, its date, the country he visited on that day, the specific city he was in, and the usd_amount he spent that day.

SELECT * FROM travel_spending
