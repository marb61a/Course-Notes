Instruction
The second table of the exercise is introduced here
  - In this case it is the project table

Exercise
Select all information from the project table.
A project is a creative initiative which asks supporters for money. Each project has:

    id – identifier of the project,
    category – category of the project, like traveling, games, etc.,
    author_id – id of the supporter who created the project
    minimal_amount – it signifies a concept well known on crowdfunding websites – this is the minimal amount which you think is necessary to complete your project. 
                    If you raise more than that – fantastic, your project can be even better. 
                    If you do not exceed the minimal amount, however, the fund raising fails and the money goes back to supporters.

Solution
SELECT * FROM project


Instruction
The third and final table of the exercise is the donation table

Exercise
Select all information from the donation table.
Each donation has an id, is associated with a specific project_id, was donated by a specific supporter (supporter_id) 
  - in a given amount (amount) on a given day (donated). 
  - Additionally, between amount and donated, you can find a column amount_eur, which is amount converted from US dollar to euro.
  - In our model, supporters can donate as much money as they deem appropriate.

Solution
SELECT * FROM donation

What is a Common Table Expression?
  - It can be thought of as a temporary set of rows that a user defines and then uses in the query
  - They are similar to subqueries

WITH some_name AS (your_cte)
  SELECT ... 
  FROM some_name
  
  

Exercise
