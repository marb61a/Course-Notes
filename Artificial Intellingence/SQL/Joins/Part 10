Instruction
If in the previous example there was a need to show the treatment type that has been recommended for each patient instead of showing their ID
  - This would have meant using a third table in this case the therapy table and an extra join which is not an issue
SELECT
  treatment_type,
  physician.id AS physician_id,
  patient.first_name,
  patient.last_name,
  experience
FROM patient
JOIN physician
  ON patient.email = physician.email
JOIN therapy
  ON patient.id = patient_id
WHERE experience > 5  

Exercise
For each patient, list the treatment that they have been recommended. Select the ID and first and last name of each patient. 
  - Additionally, show the type of treatment that the patient has been recommended (name it type) along with a list of the names of available treatment sessions. 
  - Only list treatments that are cheaper than $100.

Solution
SELECT
	pt.id,
	pt.first_name,
    pt.last_name,
    t.type,
    t.name
FROM patient pt
JOIN therapy th
ON pt.id = th.patient_id
JOIN treatment t
ON th.treatment_type = t.type
WHERE t.price < 100

WHERE type != 'relaxation'
  AND ph.first_name = 'James'
  AND ph.last_name = 'Ferris'
