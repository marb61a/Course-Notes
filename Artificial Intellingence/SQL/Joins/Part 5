Instruction
There is another table that needs to be looked at, the nutrition_data table
  - The information about the calorie count of a product is stored in the nutrition_data table.
This means that there has been 3 tables introduced as part of the exercise
  - They can all be viewed at the same time using joins as below in the example
SELECT
  *
FROM product
JOIN department
  ON product.department_id = department.id
JOIN nutrition_data
  ON nutrition_data.product_id = product.id
WHERE department.name = 'bakery'

Exercise
The nutrition_data table has 5 columns
    product_id – the ID of a given product,
    carbohydrate – the amount of carbohydrates in a given product,
    protein – the amount of protein in a given product,
    fat – the amount of fat in a given product,
    calories – the calorific value of a given product.

For the exercise
