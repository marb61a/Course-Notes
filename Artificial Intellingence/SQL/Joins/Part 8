  - And the name of that hypernym's hypernym (name the column grandhypernym).
  - Only include words that have both a direct hypernym and a "grandhypernym".

    gh.word as grandhypernym
FROM dictionary d
JOIN dictionary h
ON d.hypernym_id = h.entry_id
JOIN dictionary gh
ON h.hypernym_id = gh.entry_id

  - Show all such entries, even those that don't have direct hypernyms or grandhypernyms.
  
Solution
SELECT
	d.word as entry,
    h.word as hypernym,
    gh.word as grandhypernym
FROM dictionary d
LEFT JOIN dictionary h
ON d.hypernym_id = h.entry_id
LEFT JOIN dictionary gh
ON h.hypernym_id = gh.entry_id

    o.name as older_sibling
FROM person p
LEFT JOIN person o
ON p.mother_id = o.mother_id
AND p.father_id = o.father_id
