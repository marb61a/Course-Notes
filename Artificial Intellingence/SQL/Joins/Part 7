Exercise
Show the name and price of each product in the 'fruits' and 'vegetables' departments. Consider only those products that are not produced by 'GoodFoods'.
  - Remember that if you place the condition for the producer's name in the WHERE clause, you won't get rows for products without a producer.
  
Instruction
SELECT 
	p.name,
    p.price 
FROM product p
LEFT JOIN producer pr 
ON pr.id = p.producer_id
AND pr.name != 'GoodFoods'
JOIN department d 
ON d.id = p.department_id
WHERE d.name = 'fruits' OR
d.name = 'vegetables'


Instruction
This part of the course focuses on join a table with itself
  - When you join a table with itself, you must alias both occurrences of the table name. 
  - Moreover, the column names you refer to must be preceded by the alias of the table you want. 
  - This way, the database can distinguish which copy of the table you want to select a particular column from.
