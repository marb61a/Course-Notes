Show model, brand, mileage and production year from the car table for these cars that were produced after the 'Roadmaster' (id = 2) 
  - and whose original price is greater than original_price of 'Speedster' (id = 1).

Solution
SELECT
	c2.model,
    c2.brand,
    c2.mileage,
    c2.prod_year
FROM car c
JOIN car c2
ON c2.prod_year > c.prod_year
AND c.id = 2
JOIN car c3
ON c2.original_price > c3.original_price
AND c3.id = 1


Exercise
Show the model, brand, and final price of each car sold at the auction. Consider only those sold cars that have more mileage than the car with id = 4.

Solution
SELECT
	c.model,
    c.brand,
    ca.final_price
FROM car c
JOIN charity_auction ca
ON c.id = ca.car_id
AND ca.final_price IS NOT NULL
JOIN car c2 
ON c2.mileage < c.mileage
AND c2.id = 4


Exercise
Show the model and brand of each car whose initial_price was in the price range of the buyer with id = 3, but whose final_price was outside the buyer's price range.

Solution
SELECT
  c.model,
  c.brand
FROM car c
JOIN charity_auction ch
ON ch.car_id = c.id
JOIN buyer b
ON b.funds >= ch.initial_price
AND b.funds < ch.final_price
WHERE b.id =3


Exercise
Show each buyer's ID (rename the column to buyer_id) together with the model and mileage of the car they bought.
    - If a potential buyer didn't buy any car, show their ID anyway.

Solution
SELECT
  b.id AS buyer_id,
  c.model,
  c.mileage
FROM buyer b 
LEFT JOIN charity_auction a
ON b.id = a.buyer_id
AND b.id <= a.final_price
LEFT JOIN car c
ON c.id = a.car_id
