Another JOIN type is the FULL JOIN. FULL JOIN is a union of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. 
It shows matching rows from both tables, rows that have no match from the left table, and rows that have no match from the right table. Take a look at this example:

SELECT
  course.name
  lecturer.name
FROM course
FULL JOIN lecturer
  ON course.lecturer_id = lecturer.id

Exercise
Display the title of each book along with the name of its author. Show all books, even those without an author. 
Show all authors, even those who haven't published a book yet. Use a FULL JOIN.

Solution
SELECT 
	TITLE, 
    NAME
FROM BOOK
FULL JOIN AUTHOR ON
AUTHOR.ID = BOOK.AUTHOR_ID


Instruction
Cool! One of the last things we would like to show you is a special kind of JOIN: the CROSS JOIN. Here's the general syntax of a CROSS JOIN:

SELECT
  *
FROM book
CROSS JOIN author

The result of a CROSS JOIN is known as a Cartesian product. In short CROSS JOIN combines all rows from one with all rows from the right table, 
essentially producing all possible combinations.

Exercise
Your school is holding a contest in which you're tasked with correctly matching the names of authors to the names of the books 
they wrote from a list of all book-author pairs.
Generate all possible pairs of book titles and author names. Consider only books whose author's name is Ray Henry.

Solution
SELECT 
	TITLE, 
    NAME
FROM BOOK
CROSS JOIN AUTHOR
WHERE NAME = 'Ray Henry'
