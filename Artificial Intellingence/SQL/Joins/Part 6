Exercise
For each product display
    the name of the company that produced it (alias the column to producer_name),
    the name of the department where the product is located (alias it to department_name),
    the name of the product (alias it to product_name),
    the total number of carbohydrates in the product.

The query should still consider products with no information about producer_id, department_id or product_ids

Solution
SELECT 
	pr.name as producer_name,
    d.name as department_name,
	p.name as product_name,
    n.carbohydrate       
FROM product p
LEFT JOIN department d ON
d.id = p.department_id
LEFT JOIN producer pr ON
pr.id = p.producer_id
LEFT JOIN nutrition_data n
ON n.product_id = p.id


Instruction
There is now to be another table added for the exercise
  - This time it is the sales_history table

Exercise
The sales_history table consists of the following three columns:

    product_id - the ID of a given product,
    date - the date of sale, and
    amount - the amount of a given product sold on a particular day.

For every day in the sales_history table show the sales of the products with ID's 13, 18, and 15.
Display the date, name, amount, and calorific value of a product.
Order the results by date and then by calorific value.
