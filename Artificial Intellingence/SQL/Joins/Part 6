Exercise
For each product display
    the name of the company that produced it (alias the column to producer_name),
    the name of the department where the product is located (alias it to department_name),
    the name of the product (alias it to product_name),
    the total number of carbohydrates in the product.

The query should still consider products with no information about producer_id, department_id or product_ids

Solution
SELECT 
	pr.name as producer_name,
    d.name as department_name,
	p.name as product_name,
    n.carbohydrate       
FROM product p
LEFT JOIN department d ON
d.id = p.department_id
LEFT JOIN producer pr ON
pr.id = p.producer_id
LEFT JOIN nutrition_data n
ON n.product_id = p.id


Instruction
There is now to be another table added for the exercise
  - This time it is the sales_history table

Exercise
The sales_history table consists of the following three columns:

    product_id - the ID of a given product,
    date - the date of sale, and
    amount - the amount of a given product sold on a particular day.

For every day in the sales_history table show the sales of the products with ID's 13, 18, and 15.
Display the date, name, amount, and calorific value of a product.
Order the results by date and then by calorific value.

Solution
SELECT 
	s.date,
    p.name, 
    s.amount,
    n.calories
FROM product p
JOIN producer pr ON
pr.id = p.producer_id
JOIN nutrition_data n
ON n.product_id = p.id
JOIN sales_history s
ON s.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.id IN (13, 15, 18)
ORDER BY s.date, n.calories


Exercise
For every sale that happened between 2015-01-15 and 2015-02-21, show:

    the date of the sale,
    the name of the producer (rename the column to comp_name),
    product name - rename the column to product_name,
    the total price for this product (calculated using the price per unit and amount). Alias the column to total_price.

Solution
SELECT 
	s.date,
	pr.name as comp_name,
	p.name as product_name,
    p.price * s.amount as total_price      
FROM product p
JOIN producer pr ON
pr.id = p.producer_id
JOIN sales_history s
ON s.product_id = p.id
WHERE s.date BETWEEN
'2015-01-15' AND '2015-02-21'


Exercise
For products that weren't sold even once between 2015-02-01 and 2015-02-05, show the product name (rename the column to product_name),
	- It's price and the producer's name (rename the column to company_name). 
	- Display all products that haven't been sold in this interval, also the ones that don't belong to any company.
	
Solution
SELECT 
	p.name as product_name,
    p.price,
    pr.name as company_name    
FROM product p
LEFT JOIN producer pr ON
pr.id = p.producer_id
LEFT JOIN sales_history s
ON s.product_id = p.id
AND s.date BETWEEN
'2015-02-01' AND '2015-02-05'
WHERE s.product_id IS NULL
