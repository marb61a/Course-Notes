Most JOIN queries use an ON condition specifying that the primary key of one table should equal the foreign key of another table.
    - But nothing stops us from joining tables based on different columns

Exercise
There are 2 tables Student and Band
    - Suppose you want to show each student name along with the name of the band that plays their favorite genre of music. How can you approach this problem?
    - The template shows the two tables connected on the type of music which gives the wanted result 
    - Note that if there are multiple bands matching a particular student's favorite genre of music,
