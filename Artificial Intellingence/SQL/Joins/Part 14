Solution
SELECT
    sg.id as group_id,
    sg.language,
    sg.group_level,
    t1.room_id,
    t1.day
FROM student_group sg
JOIN timetable t1
ON t1.group_id = sg.id
JOIN timetable t2
ON t1.group_id = t2.group_id
AND t1.room_id= t2.room_id
WHERE t1.day <> t2.day


Exercise
For all groups taught in the La Lingua school, show the following information:

    the ID of a given group,
    the name of the lecturer who teaches that group,
    the language that the group learns,
    the level of the group, and
    the days and hours when the group has lectures.

However, show this information only for those groups that have both their lectures at the same hour and whose tuition is greater than 800 dollars.

Solution
SELECT
    sg.id,
    l.name,
    sg.language,
    sg.group_level,
    t1.day,
    t1.hour
FROM student_group sg
JOIN lecturer l
ON l.id = sg.lecturer_id
JOIN timetable t1
ON sg.id = t1.group_id
JOIN timetable t2
ON sg.id = t2.group_id
JOIN tuition tn 
ON tn.group_id = sg.id
WHERE tn.cost > 800
AND t1.day != t2.day
AND t1.hour = t2.hour
