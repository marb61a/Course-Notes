Instruction
There is what maybe a fairly large caveat to keep in mind when using LEFT JOIN and similar
  - There is a subtle difference between the conditions in the ON and WHERE clauses when using JOINs
  - The ON condition is evaluated when the tables are joined.
  - The WHERE condition is applied after the rows have been joined
An example is shown below
SELECT
  course.name,
  lecturer.name
FROM course
LEFT JOIN lecturer
  ON course.lecturer_id = lecturer.id
WHERE lecturer.id = 3

This query will list all courses but only those that are taught by the lecturer with id = 3
  - Other courses will not have their lecturer information listed, even if there is a lecturer assigned to them
  - One further thing to keep in mind is that when using INNER JOINs, conditions in the ON and WHERE clauses are effectively the same

Exercise
Show the title of each book and the name of its author â€” but only if the author was born in the 20th century.
  - Otherwise, the author's name field should be NULL.

Solution
SELECT
	b.title,
    a.name
FROM book b
LEFT JOIN author a
ON b.author_id = a.id
AND a.birth_year BETWEEN 1901 AND 2000


Exercise
For every auctioned item that was sold for a price greater than its initial price, show the item name together with the name of its buyer and the price they paid.

Solution
SELECT
	ai.name,
    b.name,
    b.final_price
FROM auction_item ai
JOIN bidder b
ON ai.id = b.bought_item_id
WHERE b.final_price > ai.initial_price
