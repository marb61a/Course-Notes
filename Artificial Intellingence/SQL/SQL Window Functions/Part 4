Instruction
Of course, you can add a WHERE clause just as you do in any other query:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER(),
  salary - AVG(salary) OVER()
FROM employee
WHERE department_id = 1;

Now, we only calculate the salaries in the department with id = 1. Two exercises ago, we said that OVER() means 'for all rows in the query result'. 
This 'in the query result' part is very important â€“ window functions work only on the rows returned by the query.
Here, this means we'll get the salary of each IT department employee and the average salary in that department, and not in the entire company.
That's a very important rule which you need to remember. 
Window functions are always executed AFTER the WHERE clause, so they work on whatever they find as the result

Exercise
Show the first_name, last_name and salary of every person who works in departments with id 1, 2 or 3, 
along with the average salary calculated in those three departments.

Solution
select
	first_name,
    last_name,
    salary,
    avg(salary) over()
from employee
where department_id in (1,2,3)



Instruction
Now, it might be tempting to use window functions in a WHERE clause, as in the example:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  salary,
  AVG(salary) OVER()
FROM employee
WHERE salary > AVG(salary) OVER();

However, when you run this query, you'll get an error message. You cannot put window functions in WHERE. 
Why? The window functions is applied after the rows are selected. If the window functions were in a WHERE clause, you'd get a circular dependency:
in order to compute the window function, you have to filter the rows with WHERE, which requires to compute the window function.
