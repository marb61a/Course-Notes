Instruction
At the end of this course, you will be able to write complex window function examples with ease. 
Just take a look at this query, which allows us to see the sum of payments a given person made, 
and the fourth largest value of the sum of payments as a separate column:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  SUM(payment_amount),
  NTH_VALUE(SUM(payment_amount),4) OVER(ORDER BY 
    SUM(payment_amount)
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING 
      AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
FROM single_rental
JOIN customer
  ON customer.id=single_rental.customer_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;

Such queries won't be a problem for you at all! But, as we mentioned previously, there are some prerequisites. 
Precisely speaking, you need to know how to retrieve data from a single table, from multiple tables (with JOINs), how to use ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING.
We've decided to prepare a short quiz for you that will test your skills. 
The rule is simple: if you know the right answers to all the questions, this course is right for you! 
Don't worry, you won't have to write much: the quiz is going to be short and painless.
First, let's take a look at the tables we'll use for the quiz. We're going to work with dogs and their owners.

Exercise
Select all the information from the person table.
Each person has a id, first and last name and their age.

Solution
Select * from person


Exercise
Select all the information from the dog table.
Each dog has an id, an owner_id (this id comes from the table person), a certain name and breed, and its age as well.

Solution
Select * from dog


Exercise
For each person, show first_name, last_name and age. Sort the rows by the age in the descending order.
