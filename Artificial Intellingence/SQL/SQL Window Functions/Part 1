At the end of this course, you will be able to write complex window function examples with ease. 
Just take a look at this query, which allows us to see the sum of payments a given person made, 
and the fourth largest value of the sum of payments as a separate column:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  SUM(payment_amount),
  NTH_VALUE(SUM(payment_amount),4) OVER(ORDER BY 
    SUM(payment_amount)
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING 
      AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
FROM single_rental
JOIN customer
  ON customer.id=single_rental.customer_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;

Such queries won't be a problem for you at all! But, as we mentioned previously, there are some prerequisites. 
Precisely speaking, you need to know how to retrieve data from a single table, from multiple tables (with JOINs), how to use ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING.
We've decided to prepare a short quiz for you that will test your skills. 
The rule is simple: if you know the right answers to all the questions, this course is right for you! 
Don't worry, you won't have to write much: the quiz is going to be short and painless.
First, let's take a look at the tables we'll use for the quiz. We're going to work with dogs and their owners.

Exercise
Select all the information from the person table.
Each person has a id, first and last name and their age.

Solution
Select * from person


Exercise
Select all the information from the dog table.
Each dog has an id, an owner_id (this id comes from the table person), a certain name and breed, and its age as well.

Solution
Select * from dog


Exercise
For each person, show first_name, last_name and age. Sort the rows by the age in the descending order.

Solution
select
	first_name,
    last_name,
    age
from person
order by age desc


Exercise
Show the name of each dog along with the first and last name of its owner.

Solution
select
	d.name,
    p.last_name,
    p.first_name
from person p
join dog d 
on p.id = d.owner_id


Exercise
For each owner, show their id AS dog_owner_id and the number of dogs they have.

Solution
select
	p.id as dog_owner_id,
	count(owner_id) 
from dog d
join person p
on p.id = d.owner_id 
group by p.id


Exercise
Show each breed with the average age of the dogs of that breed. Do not show breeds where the average age is lower than 5.

Solution
select
	breed,
    avg(age)
from dog
group by breed
having avg(age)>=5



Instruction
In the previous part, we showed you a very complicated query that might have looked a bit scary to you. 
In this part, we're going to start from the very beginning. Step by step, you will learn new elements that make up window functions. 
We hope that at the end of our course, you will take one more look at that scary example and think: this is now so easy!
But first things first. We'll start with introducing today's tables. 
We're going to deal with employees, their departments and purchases in each department. 
Not very original, you can find such tables in many database examples, but that's exactly the point â€“ 
we want you to feel comfortable when you take your first steps with window functions.

Exercise
Select all the information from table employee.
The table presents all employees at some point in time.
Each employee has a first and last name, a department in which they work, their salary and the number of full years they have worked in the company so far

Solution
Select * from employee
