Instruction
Great, now we can get down to work. Back in Part 1, we said that you can't use window functions in the WHERE clause. 
Why is that so? Because all query elements are processed in a very strict order:

    FROM – the database gets the data from tables in FROM clause and if necessary performs the JOINs,
    WHERE – the data are filtered with conditions specified in WHERE clause,
    GROUP BY – the data are grouped by with conditions specified in WHERE clause,
    aggregate functions – the aggregate functions are applied to the groups created in the GROUP BY phase,
    HAVING – the groups are filtered with the given condition,
    window functions,
    SELECT – the database selects the given columns,
    DISTINCT – repeated values are removed,
    UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT – the database applies set operations,
    ORDER BY – the results are sorted,
    OFFSET – the first rows are skipped,
    LIMIT/FETCH/TOP – only the first rows are selected

Practically, this order means that you can't put window functions anywhere in the FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY or HAVING clauses. 
This is because at the time of calculating these elements, window functions are not yet calculated – 
and it's impossible to use something which is not already available.

Exercise
Find out for yourself that window functions don't work in the WHERE clause. 
Look at the template: we would like to show some information for those auctions which have their final_price higher than the average final_price.
Try to run this query. When you're done, press I'm done. Next exercise to continue.

Solution
SELECT 
  id, 
  final_price 
FROM auction 
WHERE final_price > AVG(final_price) OVER()



Instruction
As you can see, the query did not succeed. So, how can we select some information for those auctions which had their final_price higher than the average final_price?
We have to use a subquery. Take a look:

SELECT
  id,
  final_price 
FROM (
  SELECT
    id,
    final_price,
    AVG(final_price) OVER() AS avg_final_price
  FROM auction) c
WHERE final_price > avg_final_price

In the FROM clause, we introduced a subquery where we selected both the final_price for each auction and the average final_price.
Because the whole subquery is calculated before the external query, we can use avg_final_price in the external query.
