Exercise
Take the statistics for website_id = 1. For each row, show the day, 
the number of clicks on that day and the median of clicks in May 2016 
(calculated as the 16th value of all 31 values in the column clicks when sorted by the number of clicks).

Solution
select
    day,
    clicks,
    nth_value(clicks, 16) over(
      order by clicks rows between unbounded preceding 
      and unbounded following
    )
from statistics
where website_id = 1 and 
day between '2016-05-01' and '2016-05-31'


Exercise
For each statistics row of website_id = 3, show the day, the number of clicks on that day and a ratio expressed as percentage: 
the number of clicks on that day to the greatest number of clicks on any day. Round the percentage to integer values.

Solution
select
    day,
    clicks,
    round(cast(clicks as numeric)*100/first_value(clicks) 
      over (
        order by clicks desc
      ),0
    ) 
from statistics
where website_id = 3
