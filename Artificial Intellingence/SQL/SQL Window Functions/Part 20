Instruction
The query worked fine this time. Here's one thing you should remember: while FIRST_VALUE works well with the default window frame, 
LAST_VALUE needs an explicit definition of the right window frame to actually make sense.

Of course, you can order by one column and return the other:

SELECT
  name,
  budget,
  LAST_VALUE(budget) OVER(
    ORDER BY opened
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
      AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
FROM website;

Here we show the budget of the most recent website (not the greatest budget).
Now, you're ready to write your own example!

Exercise
Show the statistics for website_id = 1. For each row, show the day, the number of impressions and the number of impressions on the day with the most users.

Solution
select
	  day,
    impressions,
    last_value(impressions) over(
      order by users
      rows between unbounded preceding
      and unbounded following
    )
from statistics
where website_id = 1


Exercise
For each statistics rows with website_id = 1, show the day, the number of users, the number of users on the last day and the difference between these two values.

Solution
select
	  day,
    users,
    last_value(users) over(
      order by day
      rows between unbounded preceding
      and unbounded following
    ),
    users- last_value(users)over(
      order by day rows between unbounded preceding 
      and unbounded following
    )
from statistics
where website_id = 1
