and the average payment_amount from single rentals by any customer from the same country.

Solution
select 
	distinct c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    avg(s.payment_amount) over(
      partition by c.id
    ),
    avg(s.payment_amount) over(

Instruction
Take a look at this example:

WITH ranking AS
  (SELECT
    title,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY editor_rating DESC) AS rank
  FROM movie)

SELECT title
FROM ranking
WHERE rank = 2;

In the above example, we show the title of the second best movie in terms of the editor_rating.

Exercise
For each movie, show the following information: title, release_year, editor_rating and the rank based on editor_rating. 
The movie with the highest editor_rating should have rank = 1. The same rank values are possible for multiple rows, but don't leave gaps in numbering.

Solution
select 
	title,
	release_year,
	editor_rating,
    dense_rank() over(
      order by editor_rating desc
    )
from movie 


Exercise

Solution
select
   m.title,
    s.rental_period,
    s.payment_amount,
    rank() over(
      order by s.payment_amount desc
    )
from movie m
join single_rental s
on m.id = s.movie_id
