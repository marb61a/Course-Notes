Instruction
Subqueries can also be used within the column list in a SELECT clause. Here it's important that the subquery returns exactly one row and column.

Take a look:
SELECT
  name,
  (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM trip
    WHERE city_id = city.id) AS trip_count
FROM city;

In the above query, we provide the name of each city together with the number of trips to that city. 
Notice that we use the function COUNT() to count the number of trips for each city.

Exercise
Show each mountain name together with the number of hiking trips to that mountain (name the column count).

Solution
SELECT NAME,
(
	SELECT COUNT (*)
  	FROM HIKING_TRIP
  	WHERE MOUNTAIN_ID = MOUNTAIN.ID
) AS COUNT FROM MOUNTAIN


Instruction
Okay, let's introduce the tables we'll have as our guests today. Fortunately, just two of them this time.
Do you do play sport? Even if not, we're going to deal with sportsmen and sportswomen this time. 
We're going to analyze two tables which contain information about medals that various people won in two Olympic disciplines.

Exercise
Display the contents of the table cycling.

Solution
SELECT * FROM CYCLING


Instruction
Great, let's find out what we have in there. As you can see, the table contains the following columns:

    id which is the identification number for each medal.
    person which is the first and last name of the person who won the medal.
    country which the person represented.
    year when the medal was won.
    place which indicates the kind of medal (1 – gold, 2 – silver, 3 – bronze).

There are, of course, various categories of cycling, but to make things easier, we don't care about them here. 
We've just picked some sportsmen and sportswomen and put their medals in the table, not too many, so that you can get the hang of the table quickly.

Exercise
Display the contents of the table skating.

Solution
SELECT * FROM SKATING


Instruction
Let's start off with a new keyword UNION. What is a union? Well, to make a long story short, it combines results of two or more queries. Let's analyze the example:

SELECT *
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'Germany'
UNION
SELECT *
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'Germany';

As you can see, we first selected all medals for Germany from the table cycling, 
then we used the keyword UNION and finally we selected all medals for Germany from the table skating.
You may be tempted to ask: Could we split this instruction into two separate queries? Of course we could. 
But using a UNION, we get all results for the first table PLUS the results of the second table shown together. 
Remember to only put the semicolon (;) at the very end of the whole instruction!

Exercise
Show all the medals for the period between 2010 and 2014 for skating and cycling. Use the UNION keyword.

Solution
SELECT * FROM SKATING
WHERE YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014
UNION
SELECT * FROM CYCLING
WHERE YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014


Instruction
Okay, how does the magic work? How can we show two tables as one?
As you probably expect, both tables must have the same number of columns so that the results can be merged into one table. 
Makes sense, right? You should also remember that the respective columns must have the same kind of information: number or text.
If one of your tables puts numbers in the column place (1, 2, 3) and the other puts texts ('first', 'second', 'third'), the trick won't work.
