Instruction
It's time to run your first SQL query! As you remember, the data in a database are stored in tables.

You can see all data in the user table with this query:

SELECT *
FROM user;

SELECT tells your database that you want to select data. FROM user tells the database to select data from the table user.
Finally, the asterisk (*) tells the database that you want to see all columns in this table.
Remember that it is a good practice to always end your SQL command with a semicolon (;). A semicolon is like a period at the end of the sentence. 
It tells the database that you're done with your command.

Exercise
In our example database there is a car table, which contains information about a few cars.
Select all data from the car table and click Run and check code.

Solution
SELECT * FROM CAR



Introduction
As you can see, the table car has 5 columns:

    vin – short for vehicle identification number
    brand
    model
    price
    production_year.

The names of the columns are at the top of the result.
There are 8 cars in our table: two Ford cars, one Toyota, three Volkswagens, one Fiat and one Opel. 
You can see that the price of a Toyota is $11,300 and the prices for Fords are $8,000 and $12,500.
Note that the price for Opel is not specified – we'll explain that later.

Exercise
Examine the result.
