Exercise
Get all the data from the table student.

Solution
SELECT * FROM STUDENT


Instruction
There are only three columns in the table student: id, name, and room_id. 
The column id is the identification number of each student in our table, name is the full name of the student. 
room_id is the id of the room which the student lives in. The room id is, of course, taken from the table room.
If you examine the table student close enough, you'll find out that some students don't have a room assigned to them. 
Remember this detail – we'll make use of this information later on.

Exercise
Get all the data from the table equipment

Solution
SELECT * FROM EQUIPMENT


Instruction
The table equipment is very much similar to the table student. It has three columns:

    id – the id of the equipment piece.
    name – which tells us what it is.
    room_id – the room where we can find the piece of equipment.

Note that some pieces aren't assigned to any room – they are simply stored in the warehouse, in case you're curious.
