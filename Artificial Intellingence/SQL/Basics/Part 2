Instruction
There is one more very important conditional operator, the inequality sign (!= or sometimes <>). Look at the example:

SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE age != 18;

See how easy it is? We've used the inequality sign (!=) to select all users who aren't 18.

Exercise

WHERE PRICE <= 11300;


Instruction
Up until now, we were able to filter the rows in the previous examples using conditional operators (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=). 
But what about situations when we want to be really picky and join a few conditions?

SELECT id, name
FROM user
WHERE age > 50
  OR height < 185;

We've added a new OR clause which allows us to join more conditions.

In this case, we only select those users who are above 50 years old or under 185 cm of height. 
In other words, a row is displayed when the first condition or the second condition is true. Note that if both conditions are true, the row is also displayed.

Exercise
Select vins of all cars which were produced before 2005 or whose price is below $10,000

Solution
SELECT  
	Vin 
FROM Car
WHERE Production_Year < 2005 OR Price < 10000;
