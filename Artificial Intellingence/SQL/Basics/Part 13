Instruction
If you now compare the results of INNER JOIN with the content of the equipment table (expand the Database tab on the right), 
you'll notice that not all pieces of equipment are present in the resulting table. For example, a lovely kettle with the id 11 is not there. Do you know why?
INNER JOIN (or JOIN, for short) only shows those rows from the two tables where there is a match between the columns. 
In other words, you can only see those pieces of equipment which have a room assigned and vice versa.
Equipment with no room is not shown in the result.

Instruction
OK, we'll now learn a new kind of JOIN: LEFT JOIN.
LEFT JOIN works in the following way: it returns all rows from the left table (the first table in the query) 
plus all matching rows from the right table (the second table in the query).
Let's see an example:

SELECT *
FROM car
LEFT JOIN person
  ON car.owner_id = person.id;

The result may look like this:

Exercise
Show all rows from the table student. If a student is assigned to a room, show the room data as well.

Solution
SELECT
  * 
FROM STUDENT
LEFT JOIN ROOM
  ON STUDENT.ROOM_ID = ROOM.ID ;
 

Exercise
Select all pieces of equipment together with the room they are assigned to. Show each piece of equipment even if it isn't assigned to a room.

Solution
SELECT * 
FROM EQUIPMENT
LEFT JOIN ROOM
  ON EQUIPMENT.ROOM_ID = ROOM.ID;
