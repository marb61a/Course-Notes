Instruction
There is one more logical operator worth mentioning: NOT. Basically speaking, whatever is stated after NOT will be negated:

SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 30;

In the above example we placed NOT in front of a BETWEEN clause. As a result, we'll get all users except for those aged 20 to 30.

Exercise
Select vin, brand, and model of all cars except for those produced between 1995 and 2005.

Solution
SELECT 
	vin, 
    brand, 
    model
FROM Car
WHERE Production_Year NOT BETWEEN 1995 AND 2005;


Instruction
We can include even more conditions by using parentheses, according to our needs. 
If we want to find only those users who are above 70 years old or below 13 and who are at least 180 cm tall, we can use the following expression:

SELECT
  id,
  name
FROM user
WHERE (age > 70 OR age < 13)
  AND (height >= 180);

Exercise
Select the vin of all cars which were produced before 1999 or after 2005 and whose price is lower than $4,000 or greater than $10,000.

Solution
SELECT 
	Vin 
FROM Car
WHERE (Production_year < 1999 OR Production_year > 2005) 
AND (Price < 4000 OR Price > 10000 );


Instruction
Until now, we only worked with numbers in our WHERE clauses. Is it possible to use letters instead? Of course it is! 
Just remember to put your text in single quotes like this: 'example'.
If you wanted to know the age of all Smiths in your table, you could use the following code:

SELECT age
FROM user
WHERE name = 'Smith';

Note that the case of the letters matters, i.e. 'Smith' is different than 'SMITH'.

Exercise
Select all columns of all Ford cars from the table.

Solution
SELECT * FROM Car
WHERE Brand = 'Ford'
