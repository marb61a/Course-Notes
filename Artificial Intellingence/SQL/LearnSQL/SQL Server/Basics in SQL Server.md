Now, use the full name INNER JOIN to join the Room and Equipment tables so that each piece of equipment is shown together with its room.
INNER JOIN is the correct name for JOIN
```
  SELECT
  *
  FROM Equipment
  JOIN Room
  ON Equipment.RoomId = Room.id;
```

Show all information for all students. If a student is assigned to a room, show all information for the room as well.

```

Show all information for each student and the room they live in. Show all rooms, even ones with no students assigned to them. 
This can be accomplished with a LEFT JOIN by reordering the tables but use a RIGHT JOIN for the exercise.

We want to know who lives with the student Jack Pearson in the same room.

For each room with two beds where there are actually two students, show one row that contains the following information:
    The name of the first student.
    The name of the second student.
    The room number.
Don't change any column names. Each pair of students should only be shown once. The student whose name comes first in the alphabet should be shown first.
In terms of T-SQL, "first in the alphabet" means "less than" for text values. In other words, 'A' is less than 'B.'
