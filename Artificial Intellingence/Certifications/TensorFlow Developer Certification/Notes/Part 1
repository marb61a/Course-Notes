Deep Learning and TensorFlow Fundamentals
What is Deep Learning
  - Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning based on Artificial Neural networkd
  - Multiple layers of processing are used to progressively extract higher level features from data
  - Machine Learning is turning data into numbers and finding patterns
  - Code and math find the patterns
  - ML coding differs as ideal outputs are before rules whereas the opposite is true of traditional programming

Why use Deep Learning
  - For a complex problem can you think of all the rules that could be needed
  - Google's rules of machine learning at the following url
