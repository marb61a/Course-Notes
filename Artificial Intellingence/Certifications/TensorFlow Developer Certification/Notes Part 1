Introduction
  - Brief course outline and introduction to community as well as resources
  - Goal of the course is to get certified
  - Certification marks a person out as expert
  - Course is not only to pass exam but will be project orientated
  - Students will work alongside instructors


Deep Learning and TensorFlow Fundamentals
What is Deep Learning
  - Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning based on Artificial Neural networkd
  - Multiple layers of processing are used to progressively extract higher level features from data
  - Machine Learning is turning data into numbers and finding patterns
  - Code and math find the patterns
  - ML coding differs as ideal outputs are before rules whereas the opposite is true of traditional programming

Why use Deep Learning
  - For a complex problem can you think of all the rules that could be needed
  - Google's rules of machine learning at the following url
    - https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml
  - Deep Learning is good for
    - Problems with long lists of rules
      - ML/DL may help where traditional approaches have failed
    - Continually changing environments
      - ML/DL can adapt to changing scenarios
    - Discovering insights within large data collections
  - Deep Learning is not usually good for
    - This can be circumvented
    - When there is explainability needed, ML patterns are hard to humanly describe
    - Where a traditional simpler system is needed
    - Where errors are unacceptable, DL model outputs are not always predictable
    - When there is not much data
  - ML algorithms work best on structured data
    - Columns are called features
  - DL algorithms work best on unstructured data
  - ML algorithms from prior to DL advent are called shallow algorithms
  - Many algorithms can be used on both ML and DL depending on how problems are represented
  
What are Neural Networks
  - Turning data into numbers is called numerical encoding
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network
  - Numerical code block is referred to as a Tensor
  - After encoding data is passed to the neural network
  - It learns a lot about the data, features, weights etc
