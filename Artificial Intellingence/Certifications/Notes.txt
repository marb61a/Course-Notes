This folder will contain notes and files for studying AI and ML related certifications

These certifications will include
  - AWS Machine Learning Specialty
    - https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/
  - GCP Machine Learning Engineer
    - https://cloud.google.com/certification/machine-learning-engineer
  - Tensorflow Developer Certification

  - Azure Related certification material will be in the Devops/Azure folder

These are certifications that are available and I hope to gain, I thought that by starting
to put together folders that it would give me both motivation but also a road map that may
help in getting these certifications.

As is the necessity this folder will change regularly and there may be certifications added
or removed as it is needed.
