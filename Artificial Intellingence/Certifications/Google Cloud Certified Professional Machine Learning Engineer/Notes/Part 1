Machine Learning Problem Framing
Introduction to Machine Learning
  - Machine Learning is a  process in which we train a software program
  - This is referred to as a model and is used to make useful predctions using a dataset
  - The predictions are then used to take actions eg provide recommendations on previous purchases
  - There are 2 different types of ML
    - Supervised Learning
      - A model is provided with labelled training data
      - ML then finds patterns between the data and labels which can be expressed mathematically
    - Unsupervised Learning 
      - The goal here is to find meaningful patterns in the data
      - This means that the model should learn from an unlablled data-set
  - ML changes the way to think about problems as you will run experiments and use statistics to analyse the results
  - ML projects are comprised of 4 stages, each stage is executed in iterations
    - Problem
    - Data
    - Modelling
    - Deployment
  - ML Problem in business
    - Does a complication in business meet a certain criteria
    - What is being forecast or categorised
    - What information is actually required
  - ML Problem in software
    - What is the API for the situation where we are making a projection
    - Who is going to use the solution and how are they going to use it
