                    AWS Certified Data Analytics Speciality
                    Course Notes Part 1


Course Introduction
Welcome to the Certified Data Analytics Speciality course
  - Students will study all 5 of the modules contained in the specialty
  - The modules are
    - Collection -- Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data streams, AWS Glue
    - Storage and data management using DynamoDB, RedShift
    - Processing -- Using ETL using Glue
    - Analysis and Visualisation using Athena
    - Security using VPC

What You will get from the course
  - Learning to build Kinesis Data Streams data collection systems
    - This will be using the KPL and KCL or Kinesis Producer Library or Kinesis Client Library
  - Learning to build Kinesis Data Firehose data collection systems
    - This will use S3 and data analystics
  - Building Glue ETL and cataloging collection systems
    - This will show how to use data order and data format while streaming
  - Building DynamoDB storage and data management systems
    - DynamoDB streams
  - Building Redshift storage and data management systems
    - These will implement different storage and retrieval patterns
    - Comparing data warehouses vs data lakes
  - Populating the Glue data catalogue
    - Its relationship to the Hive metastore
  - Build EMR data processing systems
    - Learn about running EMR applications in an EMR cluster
  - Students will build streaming ETL processing systems
    - Learning about the differences between batch and streaming ETL
  - Learning about how Glue and EMR work together
    - Including how to load data into a data lake via data processing systems
  - Build Athena analysis and visualisation systems
    - Build Athena visualisations with QuickSight
  - Students will also learn about Kinesis Data Analytics
    - Learning how to analyse data in real time
    - Build real-time dashboards in Kinesis
  - Learning Elasticsearch and Kibana
    - Visualise analysis using Kibana visualisations and dashboards
  - Building secure data analytics systems
    - Building analytics systems within your VPC
  - Encrypting analytics data, EMR security configurations and encryption techniques
  - Data governance and compliance
  - The course should end with the student being an expert in AWS data analytics
    - There are 24 labs to give experience
    - The course should give the student confidence needed to take the certification exam
    - These exams are far deeper than general associate exams
    - These certifications are good for a cv

Strategies for studying efficiently
  - Outline the course as each module and lab is completed
  - Outline key terms and definitions
  - Document steps taken in the labs and and how they relate to theory
  - Create a q&a database from notes
  - You can even build a web app to hold questions
  - Take practice tests and take them repeatedly
  - Read the research for the answer to the question
  - Take tests until no guesses are needed
  - Give extra time until taking the exam
  - Study each day for hours the week before the exam

Exam Prerequisites and what the exam certifies
  - The exam is for people who work in a data analytics focused job
  - Tests knowledge on using AWS services to get insights from data
  - The exam certifies understanding of AWS services and how they can be integrated with each other
  - You will be able to articulate how AWS services fit in to the data analytics lifecycle
  - Prequisites are not compulsory but will make the task of passing easier

Exam Logistics and question types
  - There are different types of questions
  - The exam has 60 questions which are scenario based
  - These are divided into relatively weighted domains
  - Processing will have slightly more questions
  - There are some multiple choice question
  - There are also multiple response questions where there are more than 1 correct answer
  - There will be distractor answers with slightly incorrect answers to catch candidates
  - Unanswered questions will be scored as wrong
  - Try and guess quesions if needed as there will be no penalty
  - There are some unsocred questions where getting a question correct is not of benefit
  - Score is 100 - 1000 with a passing score of 750


Collection Domain
Introduction to Data Collection Sytems
  - Data Analytics Lifecycle
  - This is approached in a circular iterative manner
  - The first step is to define what the analytics problem is
  - Next is to interpret the data used to solve the problem
  - Data needs then to be cleaned and transformed
  - After has been cleaned it must then be enhanced
  - Once the data has been enhanced then it can be analysed
  - Then the data can be visualised
  - Once done then we go back to the start repeatedly until a satisfying analysis has been completed
  - The exam breaks the data collection section into 3 parts
    - Determine the operational characteristics of the data collection system
      - Streaming operational components
      - Fault tolerance and data pesistence
    - Select a collection system which handles the frequency, volume and source of the data
      - Batch, streaming and transactional data
      - Compare data collection systems
    - Select a collection system that addresses the key properties of data such as the order, the format and compression
