CRISP-DM stage three – data preparation
  - Select data
    - Task
      - Decide on the data to be used for analysis
      - Criteria include relevance to the data mining goals, quality, and technical constraints such as limits on data volume or data types
    - Outputs
      - The rationale for inclusion or exclusion which lists the data to be included/excluded
      - There should be an explanation of the reasons for these decisions
  - Clean Data
    - Task
      - This is where data quality is improved to the level required by the selected analysis techniques
      - There are various techniques used eg selection of clean subsets of the data, the insertion of suitable defaults or modelling missing data
    - Outputs
      - Data cleaning report which describes what decisions and actions were taken to address the data quality problems
      - These will have been reported during the Verify Data Quality task of the Data Understanding phase
  - Construct Data
    - Task
      - This task includes constructive data preparation operations which can include the production of derived attributes
      - It can also include new records in their entirety, existing attributes whose values have been transformed
    - Outputs
      - Derived attributes which are new attributes that are constructed from one or more existing attributes in the same record
        - This can be as simple as the result of a maths problem eg area being equal to width * height
      - Generated records are created completely new records such as a brand new customer
        - Another example can be for existing customers that have large gaps between purchases
  - Integrate Data
    - Task
      - This is where multiple data sources are integrated to create new records
    - Outputs
      - Merged data refers to merging the different information about the same object
        - An example is merging information about a shop from different sources eg Number of Employees, Size, Sales data
      - Aggregations are operations in which new values are computed by summarizing information from multiple sources
      

CRISP-DM stage four – modelling
  - Select modelling technique
    - Task
      - The first step in modelling is to select the technique to be used
      - The tool may already have been chosen but this refers to the specific technique
      - If multiple techniques are applied perform this task separately for each technique
    - Outputs
      - 
  - Generate test design
