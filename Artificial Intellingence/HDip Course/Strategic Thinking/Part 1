                    Strategic Thinking
                    Course Notes Part 1


CRISP-DM
  - An acronym standing for CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining
  - It is an open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts
    - It is the most widely used analytics model
    - It breaks the process into 6 phases
  - Phase 1 Business Understanding
    - Determine the Business Objectives
      - Task
        - The first stage of the CRISP-DM process is to understand what the customer wants to accomplish from a business perspective
        - Customers can often have objectives that compete with one another and along with any constraints present must be balanced
        - The goal of an analyst is to uncover factors that can influence the project outcome positively or negatively
      - Outputs
        - Describe the primary objective of a customer from the business perspective
          - These may have related issues which may need to be addressed also
        - An example may be keeping customers who may move to a competitor
          - Related issues may involve determining whether discounts would increase retention
        - A plan should be produced which will demonstrate how data mining and business goals are to be achieved
          - This plan should specify the steps in the rest of the project including use of tools, techniques etc
        - Criteria for what would constitute a successful project outcome should be defined
          - This should be measurable and achievable, maybe use DMAIC?
    - Assess Situation
      - Task
        - Fact find about resources, constraints, assumptions and other factors for consideration in goal determination
      - Outputs
        - There needs to be full inventory of the project's available resources, this will include personnel
        - List all the requirements of the project including schedule of completion, comprehensibility, results quality, security and legal issues
          - !!!!! Always ensure that any needed data use permissions are there or else there maybe legal difficulties
        - All projects make certain assumptions, list them
          - Any assumptions about the data being used should be verified
          - Non-verifiable assumptions may affect result validity so definitely need to be listed
        - Risks, again all projects have risks, a list of these risks and contingencies in place to lessen impact should be listed
        - Any project terminology should be put into a glossary
          - There maybe 2 needed, one for business terms and one for ML terminology which may need illustrative examples
          - This can be a very good exercise in and of itself as it may be educational
        - Cost benefit analysis should be constructed to compare costs to potential benefits
    - Determine data mining/Machine Learning goals
      - Task
        - Like business goals state objectives in business terms ML goals states objectives in technical terms
      - Outputs
        - Success Criteria which describes the the intended outputs of the project that enable the achievement of the business objectives
        - Data mining / Machine Learning success criteria which define the criteria for a successful outcome in technical terms
          - As these are likely to be subjective the person making the judgement should be identified
    - Produce project plan
      - Task
        - Describes the intended plan for achieving both ML and business goals
        - The steps for the rest of the project should be specified including tools and techniques to be used
      - Outputs
        - Project Plan which will list the stages to be executed in the project
          - This is combined with durations, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies
          - 
        -
    
  - Phase 2
