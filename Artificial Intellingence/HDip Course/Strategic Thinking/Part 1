CRISP-DM
  - An acronym standing for CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining
  - It is an open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts
    - It is the most widely used analytics model
    - It breaks the process into 6 phases
  - Phase 1 Business Understanding
    - Determine the Business Objectives
      - Task
        - The first stage of the CRISP-DM process is to understand what the customer wants to accomplish from a business perspective
        - Customers can often have objectives that compete with one another and along with any constraints present must be balanced
        - The goal of an analyst is to uncover factors that can influence the project outcome positively or negatively
      - Outputs
        - Describe the primary objective of a customer from the business perspective
          - These may have related issues which may need to be addressed also
        - An example may be keeping customers who may move to a competitor
          - Related issues may involve determining whether discounts would increase retention
        - A plan should be produced which will demonstrate how data mining and business goals are to be achieved
          - This plan should specify the steps in the rest of the project including use of tools, techniques etc
        - Criteria for what would constitute a successful project outcome should be defined
          - This should be measurable and achievable, maybe use DMAIC?
    - Assess Situation
      - Task
        - Fact find about resources, constraints, assumptions and other factors for consideration in goal determination
      - Outputs
        -
