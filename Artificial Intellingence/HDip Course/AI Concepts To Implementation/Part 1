                    AI Concepts To Implementation
                    Course Notes Part 1


Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence 
  - To perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect

The key phrase here is MIMIC

AI is a catchall term for apps that perform complex tasks
  - These includes sub-fields like machine learning and deep learning
  - There differences eg machine learning is focused on building systems that learn or improver performance based on data
  - An important point is all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning

There are different manifestations of AI
  - Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems
  - Intelligent assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text datasets to improve scheduling
  - Recommendation Engines to provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on usersâ€™ viewing habits

AI is more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about format or function
  - It is intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions
  
The Turing Test
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test
  
Defining AI has a major limitation
  - It is not as simple as building machines that are intelligent
  - That alone does not explain what Artificial Intelligence is
  - What makes the machine intelligent?

Russell & Norvig
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach
  - Currently on 4th edition
  - Their approach to defining AI is to use the idea of Intelligent Agents
  - The definition that this has led to is 
    - AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions." 
  - They utilise 4 different approaches that have been used in AI
    - Thinking Humanly, Thinking Rationally, Acting Humanly, Acting Rationally
    - The thinking ideas are concerned with thought processes the acting parts with behaviour
  - They also are of the opinion that "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally."

Other Definitions of AI include
  - Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT
    - "algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together."
  - DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin 
    - AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence
    


History of AI (Some parts are slightly outdated)
  - The term artificial intelligence was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956
  - This was not the first time that an idea of thinking machines first appeared
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think
  - Computers can process logic, however can they think
    - There is the Chinese Room argument
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room
    - The essential idea of the Chinese room is to lock somebody who is non Chinese speaking in a room
      - The person is then passed notes in Chinese
      - There is an entire library of rules and lookup tables which should allow them to produce coherent reponses
      - However would the person actually understand Chinese
    - This is the argument used with computers, they can lookup and use rote facts but does that mean understanding

AI Themes
  - Most recent advances have been in search algorithms or Machine Learning algorithms
  - This is not really noticable to most people who tend to think of more movie like AI such as Space Ships etc
    - The type of AI usually shown on movies/tv has not had huge progress over recent times
    - The types of AI breakthroughs promised have not materialised if looked at only through this view
    - Sometimes there is a redefinition of AI after one area has been mastered
      - This is known as the AI Effect and has not been well received
  - This does not mean that there have not been there has not been advances
    - Things such as marketing insights and purchase tracking and advert customisation are AI driven
  - Only recently have some systems come close to passing the Turing Test
    - Chatbots used by police to trap online predators
  - Expectations however do not match reality
    - Human Experts are still more common than expert systems
    - Computers beating human players at certain games happens but not hugely regularly
