                    AI Concepts To Implementation
                    Course Notes Part 1


Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence 
  - To perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect

The key phrase here is MIMIC

AI is a catchall term for apps that perform complex tasks
  - These includes sub-fields like machine learning and deep learning
  - There differences eg machine learning is focused on building systems that learn or improver performance based on data
  - An important point is all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning

There are different manifestations of AI
  - Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems
  - Intelligent assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text datasets to improve scheduling
  - Recommendation Engines to provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on usersâ€™ viewing habits

AI is more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about format or function
  - It is intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions
