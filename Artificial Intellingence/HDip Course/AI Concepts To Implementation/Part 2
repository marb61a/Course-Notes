Truth Tables
  - This is a visual tool which shows how true or false a compound statement is
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table
  - Boolean Algebra
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra
    - This is used for true or false values that are represented by
      - T or 1 for true values
      - F or 0 for false values

Unary Operators
  - These are the simplest operators because they can be applied to single T or F values
  - There are 4 unary operators
    - Identity meaning True is True and False is False
    - Negation which switches a value
      - This is represented by either ¬ or ~ eg ¬True means False
      - This can be shown in a truth table where P is the proposition
        - P     ~P
        - T     F
        - F     T
