Truth Tables
  - This is a visual tool which shows how true or false a compound statement is
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table
  - Boolean Algebra
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra
    - This is used for true or false values that are represented by
      - T or 1 for true values
      - F or 0 for false values

Unary Operators
  - These are the simplest operators because they can be applied to single T or F values
  - These are the unary operators
    - Identity meaning True is True and False is False
    - Negation which switches a value
      - This is represented by either ¬ or ~ eg ¬True means False
      - This can be shown in a truth table where P is the proposition
        - P     ~P
        - T     F
        - F     T
    - Logical True and Logical False
      - Logical true always results in True and logical false always results in False no matter the premise
      - This is a truth table for these operators
        - P     T         P     F
        - T     F         T     F
        - F     T         F     F

Binary Operators
  - These are operators that require 2 propositions
    - Logical AND
      - This is also known as Logical Conjunction and is represented by ∧
      - It requires that both propositions to be true for the result to be true
        - It is logically the same as the intersection of two sets in a Venn Diagram
      - This is a truth table for AND
        P       Q         P ∧ Q
        T       T           T
        T       F           F
        F       T           F
        F       F           F
    - Logical OR
      - The Logical OR requires only one proposition to be true for the result to be true
        - It is represented by the ∨ symbol 
        - It is logically the same as the union of two sets in a Venn Diagram
      - This is a truth table for OR
        P       Q         P ∨ Q
        T       T           T
        T       F           T
        F       T           T
        F       F           F
    - Logical NOR
      - The Logical NOR requires both proposition to be false for the result to be true
        - It is represented by the ↓ symbol
      - This is a truth table for NOR
        P       Q         P ↓ Q
        T       T           F
        T       F           F
        F       T           F
        F       F           T
    - Logical XOR (Short for exclusive or) 
      - It requires one proposition to be true and one proposition to be false for the result to be true
        - It is represented by the ⊻ symbol
      - This is a truth table for XOR
        P       Q         P ⊻ Q
        T       T           F
        T       F           T
        F       T           T
        F       F           F
        
Conditional Operators
  - Logical Implication
    - This is represented by the p → q symbols
    - This leads to what are called if/then results
      - It also leads to true in all cases except where T → F
    - This is a truth table for Logical Implication
        P       Q         P → Q
        T       T           F
        T       F           T
        F       T           T
        F       F           F
