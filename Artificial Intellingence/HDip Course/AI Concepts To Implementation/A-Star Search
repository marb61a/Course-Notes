Informed Search -- Looking for solutions with guidance
  - Informed Search is also known as Heuristic Search
  - These algorithms use both depth and breadth first searches and some degree of intelligence
  - There are several algorithms that can be used and which one will depend on the nature of the problem
  - The most popular is called A* or A-Star search

A* search
  - A* search is pronounced A star search
  - This algorithm usually improves performance by estimating heuristics to minimize the cost of the next node visited
  - The total cost uses 2 metrics for calculation
    - First is the total distance from the start node to the current node
    - The second metric is the estimated cost of moving to a specific node by using a heuristic
    - When atteptimg to minimise the cost a lower value indicates a better-performing solution
  - The function for calculating A* is
    - f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
    - g is the cost of the path from the starting node to node n
    - h is the cost from the heuristic function for node n
    - f is the cost of the path from the starting node to node n plus the cost from the heuristic function for node n
  - Breadth-first search visits all nodes on each depth before moving to the next depth.
  - Depth-first search visits all nodes down to the final depth before traversing back to the root and visiting the next path
  - A* differs from this as it does not have a predefined pattern to follow
    - Nodes are visited in an order based on heuristic cost
