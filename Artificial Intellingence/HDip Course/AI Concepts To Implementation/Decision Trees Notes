                    Decision Trees Notes
                    
                    
What is a Decision Tree and How to Make One
  - Most decision making systems people use are not methodical systems eg sleeping on a problem and hope for a solution
  - Decision trees can help this by providing a diagram to aid clarity
  - The decision tree is a specific type of flowchart that can be used to visualise a decision making process
    - This maps out the differing courses of action that could be taken and the potential outcomes
  - There are usually 3 different elements involved in decision trees
    - Root Node which is the top level node and represents the ultimate objective, or big decision youâ€™re trying to make
    - Branches which come from the root and represent the different courses of action available, they often use arrows and potential costs and likelihoods
    - Leaf Nodes which represent the possible outcomes for a given course of action
      - There are 2 different types Square which indicates a decision to be made and Circle which indicates an unknown outcome or chance event
  - These elements when taken together loosely form a tree like structure and so the name
  - The question is to Why you should use a decision tree
    - Firstly decision trees are flexible due to being non-linear
      - This is because users can look at several courses of action and their outcomes
    - They can be used to communicate more easily several processes
      - Because they show cause and effect realtionships diagrammatically this can simplify what maybe complicated processes
      - They are also very easy to create even for new users
    - Decision trees are focused on probability and data, not emotions and bias
      - Non-methodical approaches such as asking other people carries with it the risk of introducing bias
      - This is because personal experience influences any advice and although well intentioned may cause problems
      - Decision trees, on the contrary, provide a balanced view of the decision-making process, while calculating both risk and reward
    - Decision trees clarify choices, risks, objectives and gains
      - Decision trees have a big advantage which is their predictive framework
        - This enables the user to map out each of the different possibilities
        - This helps determine which course of action and outcome has the highest chance of success
        - It can also help protect against decisions which have unnecessary risks and outcomes that are unfavourable
        - By the nature of the process this is a relatively creative way to approach problem solving
        - Visualising the mutitude of paths which may be available may show an unseen course of action or help optimize results
      - Decision trees enable you to flesh out your ideas fully before sinking in valuable time and resources
        - Decision trees force you to apply a methodical and strategic approach to your decisions
          - This is in contrast to some of the other ways decsions are made eg intuition
  - Creating a Decision Tree
    - Begin with the big decision to be made at the top
      - This is going to be the root of the entire diagram
    - Draw the arrowlines
      - Draw arrow lines for every possible course of action, stemming from the root again they should have likelihoods and costs with them
    - Attach leaf nodes at the end of your branches
      - What are the results of each course of action, using the Square or Circle nodes
    - Determine the odds of success of each decision point
      - This is where proper research is needed as you will need to be able to accurately predict success likelihood
    - Risk vs Reward Evaluation
      - Calculating the expected value of each decision in tree helps you minimize risk and increase the likelihood of reaching a favourable outcome
  - Best Practices for using Decision Trees
    - Keep it simple and do not overload with text
    - Use Data to predict outcomes, there is going to be guesswork but use actual data where possible
