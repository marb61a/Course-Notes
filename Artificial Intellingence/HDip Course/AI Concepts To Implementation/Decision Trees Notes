What is a Decision Tree and How to Make One
  - Most decision making systems people use are not methodical systems eg sleeping on a problem and hope for a solution
  - Decision trees can help this by providing a diagram to aid clarity
  - The decision tree is a specific type of flowchart that can be used to visualise a decision making process
    - This maps out the differing courses of action that could be taken and the potential outcomes
  - There are usually 3 different elements involved in decision trees
    - Root Node which is the top level node and represents the ultimate objective, or big decision youâ€™re trying to make
    - Branches which come from the root and represent the different courses of action available, they often use arrows and potential costs and likelihoods
    - Leaf Nodes which represent the possible outcomes for a given course of action
      - There are 2 different types Square which indicates a decision to be made and Circle which indicates an unknown outcome or chance event
  - These elements when taken together loosely form a tree like structure and so the name
  - The question is to Why you should use a decision tree
    - Firstly decision trees are flexible due to being non-linear
      - This is because users can look at several courses of action and their outcomes
    - They can be used to communicate more easily several processes
      - Because they show cause and effect realtionships diagrammatically this can simplify what maybe complicated processes
      - They are also very easy to create even for new users
    - Decision trees are focused on probability and data, not emotions and bias
      - Non-methodical approaches such as asking other people carries with it the risk of introducing bias
      - This is because personal experience influences any advice and although well intentioned may cause problems
      - Decision trees, on the contrary, provide a balanced view of the decision-making process, while calculating both risk and reward
