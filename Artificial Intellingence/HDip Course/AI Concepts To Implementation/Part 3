Truth Tables, Tautologies, and Logical Equivalences
  - Mathematicians use 2 valued logic (True or False)
  - This is also known as the law of the excluded middle
  - It will be necessary to be able to construct tables for complicated sentences
  - Where the are 3 component statements and 2 possible assignments
    - This leads to 8 possibilites as it will be 2 to the power of 3
  - When listing possibilities assign truth values to the component statements in a systematic way to avoid duplication or omission
  - The easiest approach is to use lexicographic ordering
  - The truth table for this approach would look like this
    P     Q     R
    T     T     T
    T     T     F
    T     F     T
    T     F     F
    F     T     T
    F     T     F
    F     F     T
    F     F     F
  - There are different ways of writing truth tables
  - A tautology is a formula which is "always true"
  - The opposite of a tautology is a contradiction
