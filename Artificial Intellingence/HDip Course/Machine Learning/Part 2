Cross-Validation
  - This is a resampling procedure that is used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample
  - It has a single parameter called k which refers to the number of groups that a sample has to be split into
  - This procedure is referred to as k-fold cross-validation
  - This is useful for smaller data where it is better to not reserve a portion for validation
  - When estimating generalisation errors there must be data that was not seen during training
  - The data is then split as follows
    - Training set (50%)
    - Validation set (25%)
    - Test set (25%)
