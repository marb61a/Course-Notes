                    Machine Learning
                    Course Notes Part 1


History of Machine Learning
  - In 1950 Alan Turing had a paper called Computing Machinery and Intelligence
    - This asked whether machines can think or can they behave intelligently
    - It uses an imitation game where a machine tries to convince a judge that it is human

Purpose of Machine Learning
  - Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence
  - Systems have been designed that learn and improve over time
    - They learn from data in a manner that is akin to learning
  - Learning is used in certain situations
    - Human expertise does not exist, expertise is not explainable, time changes solutions, there needs to be case specific adaptations to solutions

Learning 
  - When talking about learning it means learning general models from data of certain examples
  - Data is widely available and is relatively cheap but knowledge is the opposite
  - When building models they should be good and proper approximations to the data in use

Machine Learning Defined
  - Arthur Samuel in 1959 defined Machine Learning as follows
    - Machine Learning is the field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
  - In practice Machine Learning which can be abbreviated to ML is a collection of algorithms and techniques used to design systems that learn from data
  - There is no specific domain knowledge taken into account in ML algorithms
    - They do have strong Math and Statistics basis though
  - Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computing are what ML contains
  
Branches of Machine Learning
  - There are 2 major categories that ML algorithms fall under
    - Supervised Learning
      - These are algorithms that are trained with labelled data ie data composed of the desired answers
      - An example is using known credit card fraud use examples to train to identify new fraud
    - Unsupervised Learning
      - These are algorithms that are trained with unlabelled data
      - The goal of Unsuprevised Learning is to try and discover relationships that may be in the data
      - An example is finding more about customers that buy the same products
  - Labelled Dataset means that a certain group of data has been tagged
    - This label can be used to predict with unlabelled data to gain a new label
  - Predicting is what is called a regression problem
    - An example is using histrical house prices to predict future prices

Classification
  - One example of classification is whether or not a tumour is cancerous
  - Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label
  - Classification can be used in Pattern Recognition
    - Face, Character and Speech recognition, Medical Diagnosis and Biometrics
  - There are multiple use cases for application in Classification
    - Manufacturing such as predictive maintenance
    - Healthcare such as disease identification and risk satisfaction
    - Energy supply and demand optimisation
 
 Machine Learning Model
  - This is a statistical representation of a real-world process based on data
  - It needs existing data to learn from
  - Training a model may take anywhere from seconds or less up to weeks
