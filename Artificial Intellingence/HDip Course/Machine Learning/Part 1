                    Machine Learning
                    Course Notes Part 1


History of Machine Learning
  - In 1950 Alan Turing had a paper called Computing Machinery and Intelligence
    - This asked whether machines can think or can they behave intelligently
    - It uses an imitation game where a machine tries to convince a judge that it is human

Purpose of Machine Learning
  - Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence
  - Systems have been designed that learn and improve over time
    - They learn from data in a manner that is akin to learning
  - Learning is used in certain situations
    - Human expertise does not exist, expertise is not explainable, time changes solutions, there needs to be case specific adaptations to solutions

Learning 
  - When talking about learning it means learning general models from data of certain examples
  - Data is widely available and is relatively cheap but knowledge is the opposite
  - When building models they should be good and proper approximations to the data in use

Machine Learning Defined
  - Arthur Samuel in 1959 defined Machine Learning as follows
    - Machine Learning is the field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
  - In practice Machine Learning which can be abbreviated to ML is a collection of algorithms and techniques used to design systems that learn from data
