                    Classification and Regression 
                    Notes


Classification and Regression
  - In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities
    - An example is to classify flowers into different species or even sub-sprecies
  - Classification has 2 different types
    - Binary Classification which is distinguishing between 2 classes
      - This can be thought of as the answer to a yes\no question
      - Classifying emails as either spam or not spam is an example of a binary classification problem
    - Multiclass Classification which distinguishing between more than 2 classes
  - A clear way to distinguish between classification and regression tasks is to ask whether there is some kind of continuity in the output
    - If there is a continuation between possible outcomes then the problem is a regression one
    - One example is prediciting annual income, values may differ slightly but there is continuity
    - This is versus something like languages where something is in a language or a different language, there is no between in this case

Generalization, Overfitting, and Underfitting
  - In supervised learning, we want to build a model on the training data and then be able to make accurate predictions 
    - This is on new unseen data that has the same characteristics as the training dataset
  - If a model is able to make accurate predictions on unseen data, we say that it is able to generalize from the training set to the test set
  - In Machine Learning models the objective is to build a model that generalises as accurately as possible
  - If the training and test sets have enough in common, then we will expect the model to be accurate on the test set
