NLP, Data Science & Machine Learning - Are they different?
Introducing NLP
  - Computers are not designed to understand human speech
  - They use ones and zeroes
  - There is much more to human speech such as sarcasm
  - Computers can respond to commands using NLP
  - NLP involves giving computers the ability to process human languags
  - NLP, Data Science and Machine Learning are often used interchangably but they are different
    - Machine Learning is part of Data Science
    - Data Science is the study of data and is multidisciplinary

Data Science in the real World
  - Data Science is all around, it can seem abstract as it involves Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics and other
  - It is used in multiple areas such as Netflix which uses previously watched data among other methods of studying customer behaviour
    - This studying is used to aid customer retention
  - Another example of Data Science is Amazon which uses customer data for multiple activities
    - This includes past buying practices to predict future purchases
    - Price Optimisation to encourage purchasing
    - Users are tracked to provide as indepth an insight into their behaviour as possible
 
 NLP in the Real World
  - NLP contains fields that were historically separate fields
    - These include Speech Recognition, Computational Linguistics and Computational Psycholinguistics
  - These have overlapped with evolving technology
  - Computational Linguistics is also known as Text Mining
  - One of the biggest used NLP features is Autocomplete
    - In search engines when making a search the search offers a range of options to complete the search term
  - Spellcheck and Autocorrect are 2 other apllications of NLP
 
 NLP Pipeline
An Overview of NLP Methods
  - This is intended to conceptualise the process from raw text to being fed to an ML model
  - For example taking Amazon reviews to a point where an ML can tell if they are positive or negative

Text Preprocessing
  - Most real world data for Data Science in general is messy
  - Text data for example can be extremely unstructured
  - When NLP most of the time the datasets require preprocessing
  - This does not usually go to the extent of creating a dataset from scratch
