                    Simple Decision Trees
                    Notes

Decision Trees
  - A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences
    - This includes chance event outcomes, resource costs and utility
  - It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements
  - Decision Trees can lack accuracy at times however there are variants which will help
  - There are 2 types of Decision Tree
    - Regression Tree for continuous target variables
    - Classification for discrete categorical target variables
  - The first part of the tree is the root node
    - Where there is a decision to be made is called a root node
    - The small tree that follows from a decision is called a sub-tree

Concepts
  - The set of possible values is called the predictor space
  - This predictor space is divided into J distinct and non-overlapping regions
  - For every observation that falls into the region Rj, we make the same prediction
    - This is simply the mean of the response values for the training values in Rj
    - The goal is to minimise RSS
    - RSS is an acronym for Residual Sum of Squares
    - This is an error measure also used in linear regression settings
  - This uses a Top-Down Greedy Approach
    - This is known as recursive binary splitting
    - Top-down because it begins at the top of the tree and then successively splits the predictor space
    - Each split is indicated via two new branches further down on the tree
    - It is considered greedy because at each step of the tree building process the best split is made at that particular step
      - Instead of looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step

Stopping Condition
  - We need to understand how to control tree growth so that we can stop when there is a need to
  - Overfitting can be a problem with trees and can be controlled with limiting tree growth
  - Some stopping criteria will include
    - Minimum Observations at internal node
      - There are minimum numbers of observations required for further split
    - Minimum Observations at leaf node
      - There is a minimum number of observations needed at each node after splitting
    - Maximum Depth
      - Where the tree has reached the maximum number of layers possible
  
Data Used
  - There are 2 files in the folder which will be the data used in the notebook

Importing Data
  - It is easy to import data into Jupyter using Pandas
  - Be careful with filenames eg example.csv might cause Windows to recognise the file as example.csv.csv
  
Missing Values Treatment using Python
