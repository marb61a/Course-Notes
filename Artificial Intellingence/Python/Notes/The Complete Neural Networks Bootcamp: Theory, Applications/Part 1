The Complete Neural Networks Bootcamp: Theory, Applications
Course Notes Part 1


Section 1: How Neural Networks and Backpropagation Works
BEFORE STARTING...PLEASE READ THIS
  - The course will contain a lot of mathematics
  - Students that do not have a certain level of maths are not recommended to take the course

What Can Deep Learning Do?
  - A discussion of the application of Deep Learning
  - One example is Object Detection in an image
  - Chatbots, translation using seq2seq which is essentially 2 LSTM's one for encoding and one for decoding

3. The Rise of Deep Learning
  - LSTM's were developed in 1997
  - CNN's were developed in 1998
  - Deep Learning did not become popular until 2012

4. The Essence of Neural Networks

5. The Perceptron

6. Gradient Descent

7. The Forward Propagation

8. Before Proceeding with the Backpropagation

9. Backpropagation Part 1

10. Backpropagation Part 2
