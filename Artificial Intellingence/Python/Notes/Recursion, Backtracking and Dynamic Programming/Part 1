Section 2: Recursion
What are stack and heap memory?
  - There are 2 main types of memory, stack memory and heap memory
  - Stack memory is a special region in RAM
    - The stack is a special data type that stores active functions and local variables
    - The stack is how languages such as Python knows where to return to after finishing execution of a function 
    - Stack memory can be accessed very quickly
    - There is no fragmentation
    - Last In First Out
  - Heap memory is also a special region in RAM
    - The heap is much larger than that of the stack
    - Objects are stored on the heap
    - Heap memory can suffer from fragmentation
    - Heap memory is nothing to do with Heap data structure

Stack memory and heap memory simulation
  - A graphic presentation showing how stack and heaps work

What is recursion (recursive function call)?
  - Recursion is a method where the solution depends on smaller instances of the same problem
    - Functions are called over and over again
  - This means that we break our task into smaller problems
  - This idea can be applied to many types of problems and recursion is a very big topic in computer science
  - We must define base cases to avoid infinite loops
  - Problems can be solved with recursion or iteration
  - Recursive approaches can be more elegant
  - There are 2 different types of recursion
    - Head Recursion
      - If the recursive call occurs at the beginning of a function it is called a head recursion
      - State is saved in this method prior to jumping to the next recursion call
      - Head recursion requires more memory due to function call states being stored
    - Tail Recursion
      - If the recursive call occurs at the end of a function then it is a tail recursion
      - This is similar to loops such as for or while loops
      - This method executes all statements prior to jumping into the next recursive call
