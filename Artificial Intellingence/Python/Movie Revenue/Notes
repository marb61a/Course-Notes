                    Predict Movie Box Office Revenue with Linear Regression
                    Notes


Regression is the workhorse of Data Science
The scenario is 
  - Money has been put into the future success of a movie

Data Scientist
  - They will approach this on learning what question needs to be asked
  - Data in the read world is messy
  - Often data exploration include visualisation which is much more helpful
  - The algorithm will be Linear Regression
  - After the regression has been applied, how accurate has it been
 
 Questions
  - How much money will the movie make
    - This is not a good question as it is much too vague
  - A more specific question is how much revenue will the movie make
  - This is a much more specific case and is used in the business world
    - Overall budget will be the best thing to look at
    - There are examples of big budget movies that have been successful and unsuccessful
  - A more specific version again is can we use movie budgets to predict our movie revenue
    - Again this is a better question because it is testable
