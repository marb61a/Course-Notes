                    Predict Movie Box Office Revenue with Linear Regression
                    Notes


Regression is the workhorse of Data Science
The scenario is 
  - Money has been put into the future success of a movie

Data Scientist
  - They will approach this on learning what question needs to be asked
  - Data in the read world is messy
  - Often data exploration include visualisation which is much more helpful
  - The algorithm will be Linear Regression
  - After the regression has been applied, how accurate has it been
 
 Questions
  - How much money will the movie make
    - This is not a good question as it is much too vague
  - A more specific question is how much revenue will the movie make
  - This is a much more specific case and is used in the business world
    - Overall budget will be the best thing to look at
    - There are examples of big budget movies that have been successful
  - A more specific version again is can we use movie budgets to predict our movie revenue
    - Again this is a better question because it is testable
    - This is becuase we can check if there is a link between budgets and revenue
    - This can be measure using data and linear regression
  - In the revenue vs budget example the revenue is called by data scientists the dependent variable
    - In ML it would be called the target
  - The budget would be called the independent variable by data scientists
    - In ML it would be called the feature

Gathering Data
  - There are a couple of items that will need to be looked at when gathering data
  - Data on the feature which is movie budgets in USD
  - Data on the target which is movie revenue in USD
  - There is a website which collects data on movies
    - https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets

Cleaning Data
  - There maybe value which skew predictions
  - In this case unreleased movie which are due for release or planned release and never were
    - This is not always the case aas the site says that there are gaps or disputed figures
  - The best practice is to eliminate non-useful information, in this case movie name and release date
    - Currency symbols may also cause a problem, stick with using decimal data for the example
    - Also avoid whitespace in the headings and use descriptive names

Explore and Visualise Data
  - Visualising and cleaning may need to be done side by side
  - Jupyter Notebook
    - Can be installed locally or in the browser
