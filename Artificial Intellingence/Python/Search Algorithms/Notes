                    Notes

Linear Search Algorithm
  - Linear Search is also called a sequential search
  - The idea is that an array is searched sequentially for a specific element
  - The array is searched and the index is returned when found
  - If the element is not found then either a not found message or -1 value is returned
  - In essence there is a list of values that are searched
  - The index being used to search is zero based
  - Python 3.8 has the walrus operator which is  :=
    - https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html
    - It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression such as an index
    - A popular use case is while loops where you need to initialize and update a variable


Binary Search Iterative Algorithm
  - This is a better searching algorithm than linear
  - This only works if the list is in sorted order
  - The first step is to start with the middle element
  - If the key matches then return the index
  - If the key is less than the middle element then search the lower half
    - If more then search the upper half
