# The tutorial covers how to implement a lenet architecture using Keras and TensorFlow
# LeNet is a very popular architecture and is based on a 1988 paper which can be found at
# the following address https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/726791
# This can be thought of as being analogous to a Hello World program but in Deep Learning 
# and Computer Vision. The LeNet architecture is straightforward and small (in terms of 
# memory footprint), making it perfect for teaching the basics of CNNs. The tutorial will
# cover replicating the experiments from that paper.

# The LeNet architecture is a great real world network to learn for students because it is
# small enough to understand but can provide some interesting results. Using the LeNet network
# in conjunction with the MNIST database is fairly straightforward to run on most computers
# so that means beginners benefit. The architecture diagram from LeNet looks like the following
# INPUT => CONV => TANH => POOL => CONV => TANH => POOL => FC => TANH => FC. The LeNet architecture 
# uses the tanh activation function rather than the more popular ReLU. This is because ReLU had 
# not been used in the context of deep learning â€” it was more common to use tanh or sigmoid as an 
# activation function. However when using LeNet now then tanh is swapped out for ReLU

# There is a new file inside the pyimagesearch module --> lenet.py, this file stores the implementation
# of the LeNet architecture. This uses a sequential import which is just a directed graph. MaxPooling2D
# which is responsible for the pooling activities. Activation uses ReLU instead of Hyper Tangent. The build
# method accepts 4 parameters, width and height are both 28, depth is 1 and classes for the MNIST database
# will be 10.
