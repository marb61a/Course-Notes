# ArUco makers are similar to AprilTags as they are 2D binary patterns that computer vision 
# algorithms can easily detect. They also have very similar use cases and can be used in
# Robotics, Camera Calibration etc which makes then very important in Computer vision.
# The patterns that make up an ArUco tag are fairly easy to tell that they are generated
# rather than something that occurs naturally. 

# There are some advantages to using ArUco tags instead of AprilTags such as 
# ArUco markers are built into the OpenCV library via the cv2.aruco submodule 
# (i.e., we donâ€™t need additional Python packages). The OpenCV library itself can generate
# ArUco markers via the cv2.aruco.drawMarker function. There are online ArUco generators that
# can be used if there is a reason not to do coding.

# Learning to generate your own tags is a necessary step in order to be able to understand
# where to place them in your process. An ArUco dictionary specifies the type of ArUco marker 
# we are generating and detecting, without the dictionary we would be unable to generate and 
# detect these markers

# Deciding on which ArUco dictionary to use has a few different factors. The first is to 
# consider how many unique values are needed. If a smaller number of values is needed then
# use a smaller dictionary and do not take more than is needed. Examine the input image or
# video size, the larger the grid size gets then the larger the ArUco marker will need to be.
# One thing to note is that if using a large grid but low resolution output then markers may
# not be detectable. The final thing to consider is the inter marker distance smaller dictionary
# sizes with larger NxN marker sizes increase the inter-marker distance, thereby making them 
# less prone to false readings

# There are some ideal settings
# A low number of unique ArUco IDs that need to be generated and read
# High-quality image input containing the ArUco markers that will be detected
# A larger NxN grid size, balanced with a low number of unique ArUco IDs such that the inter-marker 
# distance can be used to correct misread markers
