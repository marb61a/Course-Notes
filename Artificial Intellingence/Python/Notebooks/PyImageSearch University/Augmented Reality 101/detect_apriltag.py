# April tags are a type of Fiducial Marker which are reference objects that are
# placed in the field of view of a camera when a video or images is being captured.
# AprilTags are a specific type of fiducial marker, consisting of a black square with 
# a white foreground that has been generated in a particular pattern. The black border 
# surrounding the marker makes it easier for computer vision and image processing 
# algorithms to detect the AprilTags in a variety of scenarios.
# AprilTag can be thought of as conceptually similar to a QR code â€” a 2D binary pattern 
# that can be detected using computer vision algorithms, however AprilTags hold only 4 - 12
# bits of data whereas QR code holds upto 3kb of data. This is a feature and not a limititation
# but is a feature as these payloads are more easily detected and less difficult to detect at
# long ranges.  

# One AprilTag library is available at the following url -> https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag 
# AprilTags and fiducial markers are used in many parts of computer vision systems such as
# Camera calibration, Measuring the distance between the camera and an object, Object size Estimation
# 3D Positioning. These tags can be created using basic software and a printer and Python libraries
# exist to automatically detect the tages for you.

# You will need to use Pip to install the  Python AprilTag library -> pip install apriltag
# This works with Python 2, 3 and OpenCV Images. OpenCV has its own implementation but has 
# difficulty with detecting some tags if partially obscured or occluded
