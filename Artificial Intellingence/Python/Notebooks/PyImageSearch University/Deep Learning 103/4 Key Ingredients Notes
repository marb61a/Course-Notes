The 4 Key Ingredients When Training Any Neural Network - Notes

The text version of the tutorial is available at the following address

There are 4 things that are needed no matter what experiments are being ran
  - A dataset
    - The dataset is the first ingredient in training a neural network
    - The combination of your dataset and the problem you are trying to solve influences your choice in loss function
    - network architecture, and optimization method used to train the model
    - An image dataset classification example consists of images and labels
    - An image dataset regression example consists of images and target output values
    - An object detection example will consist of images, labels and bounding boxes
      - This can be thought of as a subset of regression
    - An instance or semantic segmentation example will consist of images, labels and pixel masks
      - These are the hardest of the tasks listed above
  - The loss function
    - There are different loss functions used when performing different tasks
    - Regression will use Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error or Mean Percentage Error
    - Classification will use Binary Cross Entropy, Categorical Cross Entropy, binary being used for class with 2 labels
    - Object Detection will use Cross-Entropy + Regression loss
  - A model/Architecture
    - Again there are different architectures used in different tasks
    - Classification has VGG, ResNet, MobileNet
    - Object detection has MobileNet + YOLO, ResNet + SSD, VGG + R-CNN
      - This utilises a backbone network which has been pre-trained on a dataset
      - An input image will be passed on to a layer designed specifically for image detection 
    - Instance/Semantic Segmentation has U-Net, Mask R-CNN
  - An optmization method
    - There are multiple optimization methods
    - SGD, ADAM, NADAM, Rectified-ADAM, RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad
    - Each works best in certain situations, the main 3 being SGD (and variants), ADAM and RMSProp
    - Learning the main 3 will benefit students immensely
    - Run lots of experiments !!!!!
