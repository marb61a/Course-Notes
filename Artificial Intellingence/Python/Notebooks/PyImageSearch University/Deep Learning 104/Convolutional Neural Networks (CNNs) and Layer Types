Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Layer Types  --> Notes

# There is a text version of the tutorial available at the following address
# https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/05/14/convolutional-neural-networks-cnns-and-layer-types/

# The tutorial will cover CNN's and the layer types that they are comprised of. Up to this point 
# filters have been hand defined but this is not a practical solution for Deep Learning, these
# filters must be learned by the networks. Neural Networks take an input feature/image as an input
# and transform it through a series of hidden layers which is usually done using nonlinear activation 
# functions. Each hidden layer is also made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is fully connected
# to all neurons in the previous layer. The last layer of a neural network (i.e., the “output layer”) 
# is also fully connected and represents the final output classifications of the network.

# Neural networks operating directly on raw pixel intensities do not scale well and their accuracy is
# not that great either. We can use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that take advantage of the 
# input image structure and define a network architecture in a more sensible way. CNN's are not like
# other neural networks as they are arranged in a 3d volume where depth can refer to things like the
# number of channels in an images or the number of filters in a layer. Neurons in subsequent layers will
# only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, this is referred to as local connectivity
# and it saves a large number of parameters on the network.

# There are many different types of layers that can be used to build CNN's, there are some that are more
# likely to occur. CONV which is convolutional, ACT\RELU where we use the same or the actual activation 
# function, POOL or pooling
