                    Notes.txt

This is a separate notes file rather than adding to already large code files
  - This is the 3rd and final part in a series on using the TensorFlow data API

The text version of the tutorial is available at
  - https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/06/28/data-augmentation-with-tf-data-and-tensorflow/
  
TensorFlow has modules that can be imported from experimental
  - This means that they are still undergoing testing and have not been added into the main application

TF.data has been shown to be much quicker than the ImageDataGenerator class
  - This runs into a problem which is that data augmentation is typically done using the ImageDataGenerator class
  - It is not possible to use ImageDataGenerator in TF.data
  - The best way is to remove ImageDataGenerator from consideration as tf.data will improve speed of training etc
  - The methods involved are going to be larger but have benefits

Data augmentation is a critical aspect of training neural networks that are to be deployed in real-world scenarios. 
  - By applying data augmentation we can increase the ability of our model to generalize and make better, more accurate predictions on data it was not trained on.

There are 2 methods that are available in TF for data augmentation
  - The Sequential class and the preprocessing module to build a series of data augmentation operations, which is similar to ImageDataGenerator
  - We can also apply tf.image functions to manually create the data augmentation routine
