Optical character recognition, or OCR for short, is used to describe algorithms and techniques (both electronic and mechanical)
  - Which convert images of text to machine-encoded text.

When talking about OCR it is usually software that is being talked about
  - There are however hardware versions available which can be mechanical or physical
  - One example is electronic pencils/pens that automatically scan your handwriting as you write.
    - Once writing is finished connect the pen to a computer 
    - The OCR software then analyzes the movements and images recorded by your smartpen, resulting in machine-readable text

The OCR software systems operate by
  - Accepting an input image (scanned, photographed, or computer-generated) 
  - Automatically detecting the text and “read” it as a human would 
  - Convert the text to a machine-readable format so that it can be searched, indexed, and processed within the scope of a larger computer vision system 

Some software examples of OCR are 
  - Tesseract OCR
  - Cloud API's which a lot of vendors offer
  - Custom trained models

OCR is very challenging because of factors including the following
  - There are a lot of nuances in how people communicate via writing
    - This includes multiple spellings of the same word 
  - There are different styles as well as multiple different types of fonts
  - Documents can contain a lot of noise and dirt and distortion etc.
    - This can included aging, yellowing etc
  - OCR compounds the problems of NLP with the less than 100% accuracy of computer vision
    - 100% accuracy is not going to happen all the time
  - The OCR problem has not been solved
    - Things are getting better though
  - OCR requires a lot of skill to apply to projects

Early OCR
  - This dates back to 1914 and was purely mechanical
  - It was developed by Emmanuel Goldberg
