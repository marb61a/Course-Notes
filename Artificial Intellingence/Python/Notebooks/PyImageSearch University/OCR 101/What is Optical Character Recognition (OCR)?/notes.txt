Optical character recognition, or OCR for short, is used to describe algorithms and techniques (both electronic and mechanical)
  - Which convert images of text to machine-encoded text.

When talking about OCR it is usually software that is being talked about
  - There are however hardware versions available which can be mechanical or physical
  - One example is electronic pencils that automatically scan your handwriting as you write.
    - Once writing is finished connect the pen to a computer 
    - The OCR software then analyzes the movements and images recorded by your smartpen, resulting in machine-readable text

The OCR software systems operate by
  - Accepting an input image (scanned, photographed, or computer-generated) 
  - Automatically detecting the text and “read” it as a human would 
  - Convert the text to a machine-readable format so that it can be searched, indexed, and processed within the scope of a larger computer vision system
