Command mode vs. Edit mode

But first…something key to be aware of: Jupyter Notebooks have two different keyboard input modes:

    Command mode - binds the keyboard to notebook level actions. Indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin.
    Edit mode - when you’re typing in a cell. Indicated by a green cell border

    shift + enter run cell, select below
    ctrl + enter run cell
    option + enter run cell, insert below
    A insert cell above
    B insert cell below
    C copy cell
    V paste cell
    D , D delete selected cell
    shift + M merge selected cells, or current cell with cell below if only one cell selected
    I , I interrupt kernel
    0 , 0 restart kernel (with dialog)
    Y change cell to code mode
    M change cell to markdown mode (good for documentation)
