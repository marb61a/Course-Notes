A wide spectrum of bidding strategies
Target Search Page Location
 - Objective is to increase brand awareness by having Ad impressions higher up SERP

 - Scenario to be used is where you want to be seen and recognized within a certain region
Target CPA(Cost Per Aquisition)
 - Objective is to get as many conversions as possible for target CPA
 - Click cost does not matter
 - As long as clicks are being got at a profitable cost business will grow
 - Google predicts which clicks convert and how much those conversions are worth
 - Conversion value is not essential for CPA target
 - You must have conversion tracking set up
 - Should have at least 2-3 conversions per day per campaign
Target ROAS(Return On Ad Spend)
 - Objective is to bid based on return on your advertising spending
 - ROAS = Total Conversion Value / Cost
 - Google predicts which clicks convert and how much those conversions are worth
 - You tell Google what conversions are worth

Manual CPC with Enhanced CPC(ECPC)

 - Needs some trust in Google algorithm to optimise CPC for more conversions
 - Google automatically increases your bids by 30% or decreases by 100% based on how likely a click will lead to a conversion
