2 - The Primacy of Product and The Concept of Usability in Landing Page Design
Nothing is more important than having a product or service that people need and want to buy
Consultative vs Commodity
Consultative means not using a supply and demand structure
Services can be either commoditised or consultative in nature, know which type will impact on your approach to marketing
Products are the same but tend to be commodities
Price is normally the number 1 determining factor
Commodities have an extrinsic value determined by the marketplace
Consultative businesses and unique products have an intrinsic value based on both the perceived value of the customer and
the conceived value of the seller
Every page on the site should broadly be able to account for the following factors
  - Useful - Useful information, context, calls to action, does it fill a need
  - Learnable - Can visitors learn to use the site without instruction
  - Memorable - Is it unique in a way that visitors remember as they look at competitors and consider options
  - Effective - Can users actually accomplish what they want to on your site
  - Efficient - Can visitors accomplish their goals with as little effort and mental energy as possible
  - Desirable - Do people actually want it
  - Delightful - Is there an experiential element to the site that excites people about your products or services


3 - Eschew Obfuscation: Clarity and the Quest for Fewer Question Marks
Clarity is of vital importance
Clarity and simplicity = Less thought
Most important when visitor lands on your home page or landing page for the first time
Items should be self evident or failing that self explanatory
Forget about competitors only being a click away, you want ths satisfaction and to avoid any subtle frustration
Some questions to use when assessing site are 
 - Do I know where I am
 - Can I find my way back
 - Can I easily find what I am looking for
 - Can I self select


4 - The 5 Second Usability Test in Landing Page Design (and how you can use it now)
Headers and Subheaders in the context of a 5 second usability test
Website has half a second to form visual impression, you dont have much longer to tell customers about you
3 most important questions (As previous)
You cannot assess your own copy from a users perspective
A lot of sites get headers and subheaders wrong
Headers and Subheaders are the most important factors in 5 second test
Give clarity in the header not the subheader
Avoid overly gimmicky meaningless headlines



5 - The Art and Science Behind Designing High-Converting Calls To Action (CTA's)
Every page should have a CTA
CTA's can be buttons, texts etc
CTA should be very clear and not hunting for it
It should be above the fold if possible
Don't use submit use I want to ..... its much more effective
Whats going to happen next should be clear in the users mind
Action block contains CTA information
Don't ask for unneeded information
Make sure that your buttons stand out as being clickable


6 - Readability and Visual Hierarchy Landing Page Design
Users don't read on the web
Users normally glance and scan particularly early in the funnel
People have been conditioned to scan
User perceives your site more like a billboard than a book
Users will focus on what matches what they are looking for
Create visual hierarchies - inverted pyramid
Use bullet point and highlight key terms
Short paragraphs very short
Dont write in full sentences
Use simple language
Use headlines on every page
Avoid jargon and hyperbolae, be factual
Focus on essential information
Keep it very simple
Important things should be more prominent, use colour, size etc to distinguish it
Use grouping to create structure
Innovation and creation does not need to suffer
Headings should 
 - Give organisation to your page
 - Obvious visual distinction
 - Consistent, headings should have the same level of importance throughout the site
 - Don't float headings


7 - Respecting Web Conventions in Landing Page Design
Respecting conventions is very important
Consistency is on of the most powerful usability principles
The more users expectations prove right the more they will feel in control
Jakobs Law of the Web User Experience - Users spend most of their time on other websites
Only break a convention when absolutely certain that your way of doing things is just as evident
Common conventions
 - Logo in top left corner and leads to home page when clicked
 - Navigation is across the top of the page
 - Secondary navigation along the left hand side (vertical)
 - If E-Commerce shopping cart in the top right hand corner
 - Secondary utilities above navigation bar
 - Any underlined text is a link
 - Any text with a border is a button
 - Flashy rectangles are advertisements
 - Images are not clickable
 - Large text is what you want read first
 - Having site search is very important, either in centre or part of navigation bar
 - On forms have asterisks or the word required to indicate compulsory field
 - Free means free
 - Footer and header are clearly demarcated
