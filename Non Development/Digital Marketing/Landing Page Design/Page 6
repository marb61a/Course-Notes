                    Section: 3 - Principles of Persuasion in Landing Page Design
1 - Using Scarcity to Improve Conversion Rates on Your Landing Pages
Concepts applicable in everyday life but very effective in marketing
Scarcity 
 - Creates a sense of urgency
 - People would rather make a quick decision than miss out
 - If people think that they can come back anytime they are unlikely to make a decision now
 - This can be applied in any context
 - Can be time or quantity driven
 - Do not overdo it
 
Use deadlines to create urgency
 - Does not have to be a hard deadline
 - Deadlines can be for seasonal products
 - Can be a coupon code for local services
 - Deadlines to register for webinar

Be specific & Be believable
Do not be atypical for your industry
Don't pretend

2 - Principles of Persuasion: Reciprocal Concessions & Reciprocity in Landing Pages
Very prevalent in negotiations
 - Reciprocal concessions are instances where you offer a product or service that’s too expensive (asking for too much) which the
   visitor refuses (you concede). He is more likely to concede to you on the cheaper option.
 - Reciprocity is a feeling of indebtedness caused by even small token gestures or gifts.

Youʼre Less Likely to Say “No” Twice
 - The requester lowers his initial request, making it more likely that the subsequent request is accepted.
 - Under the psychological contract of reciprocity, we should concede to someone else once theyʼve made a concession to us.
 - “Door In The Face Technique”. Your first price or package can be too expensive (almost surely rejected) and the second option will
   be more likely accepted
 - The first option canʼt be too unreasonable, otherwise the rejection of that option wonʼt be seen as a concession.

Reciprocal Concession Ideas
 - Email your prospects list with discounted prices based on previous offers
 - Create a second package with additional features not usually important to the majority of your customers
 - Yes / No Exit-intent popovers
 - Offer a paid signup, then a free trial

Reciprocal Concessions + Anchoring
 - In decision making, an anchor is the first or most prominent option presented
 - People have a tendency to rely heavily on an anchor, evaluating subsequent options within the context of that initial option
 - Commonly used with pricing
 - You can even something you really donʼt intend to ever sell
 - Good use of anchors allows you to convert more users for a higher profit than without the anchor

3 - Principles of Persuasion: Anchoring and Cognitive Dissonance Theory
Engendering Indebtedness
 - People want to return good will, even if it was a small, token gesture
 - By giving gifts or extending yourself to your visitors, you can engender goodwill and a sense or reciprocity
 - Chocolate / waiter study (2002)
 - Donʼt have strings attached, donʼt ask for anything in return
 - Free advice, free tools, trials, content previews, free resources, ebooks and white-papers, consultations, audits and
   additional perks are all gestures that will create a desire to reciprocate

Donʼt Underestimate the value of a Resource Library!

Cognitive Dissonance Theory Works Well With Reciprocity
 - People don't like living in contradictions they want their behaviors (past, current and future) and beliefs to be consistent
 - We will rationalize and behave in ways that will not contradict our previous behavior and efforts
 - You are more likely to be a client of mine than a stranger because of cognitive dissonance theory
 - The more a prospect engages with your website, the more likely they are to be committed to you for your paid services / products

Cognitive dissonance theory can be applied to headlines
Cognitive dissonance should always be applied with positivity making people feel good about themselves

4 - User Scenarios and Contextual Perception in Landing Page Design
EMPATHY
 - Persuasive techniques are only effective if youunderstand your visitors
 - A lot of what you think about your visitors is probably wrong
 - They’re often not the people you think they are
 - They do things differently than you’d think they would
 - They often times have different needs for your products than you think
 
CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS OF YOUR VISITORS
 - In order for you to truly enable your visitors to accomplish their tasks, you need to be aware of who they are.
 - What led them to your site?
 - How much knowledge do they have?
 - What are their anxieties?
 - What are their expectations?

Contextual Awareness: Understanding Your Audience
Who Are They?
 - Demographics, interest groups, affinity audiences. Visitors donʼt have name tags so you need to use aggregate data from analytics
 - Age, gender and ethnicity can have a major impact on your messaging and design aesthetics
 - On site behavior and conversion rate can vary greatly by demographic group

Where did they come from?
 - Different traffic sources bring in visitors in different stages in the funnel 
 - Social media tends to bring in curious, uncommitted, top of the funnel traffic (ads vs organic make a big difference)
 - PPC offers a lot of control and you should have a sense of who these people are
 - Organic offers less control, but your analytics can tell you which keywords youʼre ranking for
 - Email can bring in highly engaged traffic, but you should still have a sense of the demographics of your email lists

User Scenarios
 - Personas are the role of the person (small business owner), but scenarios also take into account the context of their visit.
 - What brought them to the site? What was their underlying concerns or fears? What are their desires and motivations?
 - Itʼs not just task oriented - different people will approach the same task differently.
 
Creating User Scenarios
 - Bring together anyone in the company who comes into contact with prospects (regardless of the stage of the prospect)
 - Each person (or just you) should write a brief description of the person (demographics)
 - Write a detailed role for your target: Who are they? What are their anxieties? How price conscious are they? 
 - Write a detailed intent: What are they trying to accomplish on your site? How do you imagine them accomplishing their desired task? 

Walk In Their Shoes
 - Go back to your landing pages with the user scenarios you and your team put together
 - Look for commonalities and trends (stage in the funnel, age, ethnicity, anxieties, motivations)
 - Assess your information architecture: are you providing the information that eases anxieties or answers questions
 - Close your eyes and imagine YOU are your visitor - what obstacles will you face, what questions will you have?
 - Come up with ways you can lay out the information and design the conversion path in a way that makes more sense to your visitors.

Keep colouring simple
Gradients & Opacity can be used to soften colours

Once form has been added a hidden window pops up which allows addition and removal of form elements
For older demographic increase font size
Use element layouts to create as natural a look as possible

Design process can be fluid
Use boxes to centre elements better
Process will differ from project to project but Unbounce is very intuitive

7 - Finishing Page Content, Adding Icons, Footer and Working With Buttons Unbounce
Use similar colouring on footer element maybe a little lighter
http://www.flaticon.com - Free Icons
Ensure proper alignment of icons
Have a further call to action at the footer element
Add form element id link to button to enable clicking back to it

Link to smooth scroll JS code which will be pasted in.
Scroll time can be adjusted (1 second is probably about the correct time)

11 - Mobile Site Layout in Unbounce Based on Mobile Landing Page Design Guidelines
Unbounce allows for a mobile version
You will need to ensure that the show mobile version version to visitors box is checked
You will need to do a lot of manual adjusting of elements
You may need to hide or use different versions of elements for mobile versions

Design of a separate confirmation dialogue for when you click submit
There will also need to be a mobile version

13 - Assigning A/B Testing Variants in Unbounce and Assigning Traffic Weights
A/B Test Centre is where you will see data from tests
2 ways of doing tests
 - Add variant - new blank slate or Unbounce template but not recommended unless large site
 - Duplicate Variant which duplicates existing page and allows for quick making of variants
Use intuition for deciding important elements
Weight will assign traffic percentage
Have a proper naming scheme in place for variant pages to avoid confusion
Confidence interval should be >90%
