                    Landing Page Design & Web Design Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 7


CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS OF YOUR VISITORS
 - In order for you to truly enable your visitors to accomplish their tasks, you need to be aware of who they are.
 - What led them to your site?
 - How much knowledge do they have?
 - What are their anxieties?
 - What are their expectations?

Contextual Awareness: Understanding Your Audience
Who Are They?
 - Demographics, interest groups, affinity audiences. Visitors donʼt have name tags so you need to use aggregate data from analytics
 - Age, gender and ethnicity can have a major impact on your messaging and design aesthetics
 - On site behavior and conversion rate can vary greatly by demographic group

Where did they come from?
 - Different traffic sources bring in visitors in different stages in the funnel 
 - Social media tends to bring in curious, uncommitted, top of the funnel traffic (ads vs organic make a big difference)
 - PPC offers a lot of control and you should have a sense of who these people are
 - Organic offers less control, but your analytics can tell you which keywords youʼre ranking for
 - Email can bring in highly engaged traffic, but you should still have a sense of the demographics of your email lists

User Scenarios
 - Personas are the role of the person (small business owner), but scenarios also take into account the context of their visit.
 - What brought them to the site? What was their underlying concerns or fears? What are their desires and motivations?
 - Itʼs not just task oriented - different people will approach the same task differently.
 
Creating User Scenarios
 - Bring together anyone in the company who comes into contact with prospects (regardless of the stage of the prospect)
 - Each person (or just you) should write a brief description of the person (demographics)
 - Write a detailed role for your target: Who are they? What are their anxieties? How price conscious are they? 
 - Write a detailed intent: What are they trying to accomplish on your site? How do you imagine them accomplishing their desired task? 

Walk In Their Shoes
 - Go back to your landing pages with the user scenarios you and your team put together
 - Look for commonalities and trends (stage in the funnel, age, ethnicity, anxieties, motivations)
 - Assess your information architecture: are you providing the information that eases anxieties or answers questions
 - Close your eyes and imagine YOU are your visitor - what obstacles will you face, what questions will you have?
 - Come up with ways you can lay out the information and design the conversion path in a way that makes more sense to your visitors.

Keep colouring simple
Gradients & Opacity can be used to soften colours

Once form has been added a hidden window pops up which allows addition and removal of form elements
For older demographic increase font size
Use element layouts to create as natural a look as possible

Use boxes to centre elements better
