Images decrease conversion

9 - Information Architecture and Accessibility - Landing Page Design Best Practices
Information Architecture
 - The way your content is organized ...
 - What’s visible above the fold?
 - Where is your navigation and how easy is it to use?
 - Can a person always find their way back to the previous step?
Accessibility
 - How easy your site is to use.
Get your navigation right.
 - If people canʼt find what theyʼre looking for, theyʼll leave.
Visitors should always be one click away from home.
 - Web browsing has no sense of scale, no sense of direction, and no sense of location. 
Good navigation tells users what the site contains how to find it.
 - Use parent categories to group categories and to create an intuitive information architecture.
 
Site Name
 - Near the upper left corner
 - Site ID tells me Iʼm still on the site
 - Frames the entire page
 - Should look like a conventional ID (logo, distinctive visual, tagline)
 - Should click back to homepage

Sections (Primary Navigation)
 - Links to all the main sections of the site.
 - Should be across the top of the page (sometimes fixed)
 - Should be used for grouping
 - “You are here” visual indicator very important
 - On every page (except some key conversion pages)
 
Site Search
 - Appeals to search dominant users
 - “Search” or magnifying glass icon
 - Frame the box!
 - Autocomplete is great
 - Allow for common spelling errors
 
Utilities
 - Links to areas of the site that are not part of the main information architecture.
 - Sign in, register, shopping cart, about us, FAQʼs, sitemap, directory, store locator, jobs, order tracking, discussion forums etc.
 - Should be less visually prominent than other navigational elements.
 - Should be the only things above the logo.
 - Only include the most common utilities at the top - the rest go in the footer nav

Breadcrumbs
 - Easily gives visitors the ability to go back one level or go home
 - Bold or highlight the current level
 - “>” between levels (conventions)
 - The deeper the hierarchy the more useful breadcrumbs are

Page Title
 - On every page, framing the content of that specific page
 - Prominence - should be the largest text on the page
 - Gives visitors a subliminal sense of location

Footer Navigation
 - List of primary page links
 - Contact info
 - Additional site utilities
 - Social icons
 - Newsletter signup
 - Privacy policies
 - Sitemap
