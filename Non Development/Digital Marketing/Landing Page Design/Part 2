                    Landing Page Design & Web Design Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 2


7 - The Awareness Stage of the Funnel: Where It All Begins
Awareness is a commodity in short supply
Its is vitally important to capture awareness from visitors
People at this stage of the buyer cycle have low levels of commitment to your business and need reassurance and clarity
Permission Marketing - Trades free value in exchange for awareness and engagement
If you are unable to communicate clearly what you offer and how it benefits the customer there will be no interest
Your landing page 
  - Should evoke a sense of calmness
  - Not every element deserves emphasis
  - No gaudy or flashy visuals or colour schemes that are too bold
  - Make things easy to find
Your visitors are not kids in a sweet shop 
  - Too many things to click on create unnecessary distractions
  - Any emphasis on secondary conversion actions detracts from primary conversion actions
  - Supporting copy needs to be relatable and relvant
  - Visual promenence must be given to you primary conversion goal
Too much talking
  - Do not write jargon or hyperbolae, generating awareness is about capturing attention quickly
  - Unclutter your page elements
  - Clear headlines and sub headlines
  - Clearly defined action block


8 - The Interest Stage of the Funnel: Tell Me More
Higher level of commitment than awareness but not that much
Can be accomplished with a fleeting level of attention to one particular element on landing pages
Interest is always self selected
Person based selection
  - Gives visitors a chance to self identify based on their characteristics
  - Gives users clarity and context and helps them make a decision where to click to explore more
Needs based selection
  - Allows users to identify with a particular need that they are looking to meet
  - Increases in interest by offering contextual and relevant information without straining the user
 
Person based selection is usually more effective but depends on the business

The preference usability test
  - Gives users more time to evaluate two different design iterations
  - Give participants specific instructions and context
  - Great test for objective measure of clarity and figuring out which approach works for a specific page


9 - The Desire Stage of the Funnel: I Want What You Sell
Higher level of commercial commitment than the previous stages
Visitors will give you more time and attention
You cannot compel them to act prior to them being ready
Fill in any informational blank spaces
Website visitors transition from passive scanning to active reading during this stage

Trust and Security
  - One of the biggest blocks to conversions is a lack of trust and security
  - Often people are looking for tranactional assurances and social proof
  - Visitors must be allowed to determine the pace and direction of their relationship with a brand
 
Desirable actions -
  - People are still researching the product or service, facilitate with ebooks, white papers etc
  - They are also ofetn still looking at competitors, this is where differentiating yourself is very important
  - Visitors will often look for social proof eg reviews, recommendations even bad reviews are ok
  

10 - The Action Stage of the Funnel: I'm Going to Buy What You Sell
Highest level of commitment
Narural result of passing through previous stages
Products and Services differ at this stage
Products tend to be more towards practical information, services more towards psychological
Don't make people jump through any unnecessary hoops
Remove irrelevant distractions and unecessary words
Avoid any surprises


11 - The Fogg Behavior Model and how it Applies to Good Landing Page Design
Fogg Model - BJ Fogg Stanford University Professor
b = mat Behaviour = Motivation Ability Trigger
These must happen at the same time
Fogg Model has 3 types of motivation
  - Sensation
  - Anticipation
  - Social Cohesion
As you increase simplicty you increase ability and decrease perceived difficulty
3 Different Triggers 
  - Facilitators - Work with high motivation and low perceived difficulty
  - Sparks - Low on motivation high perceived difficulty
  - Signals - Straightforward no lack of motivtion or perceived difficulty
  

12 - Making Your Landing Page Design Memorable
Good design taps into the human lymbic system
Lymbic system responsible for emotion, attention, responses and memories
The lymbic system pursues pleasure and avoids pain as well as controlling spontaneous behaviour
People learn 3 ways
  - Visual 
    - images
    - colours
    - infographics
    - videos
    - tables
  - Audio
    - music
    - voice overs
    - phone calls
  - Kinesthetic
    - quizzes
    - games
    - role playing
People tend towards 1 of the 3 and there is no best way to design pages
Adding elements should not interfere with good design
Especially important during the desire & interest stages
