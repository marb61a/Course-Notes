9 - Information Architecture and Accessibility - Landing Page Design Best Practices
Information Architecture
 - The way your content is organized ...
 - What’s visible above the fold?
 - Where is your navigation and how easy is it to use?
 - Can a person always find their way back to the previous step?
Accessibility
 - How easy your site is to use.
Get your navigation right.
 - If people canʼt find what theyʼre looking for, theyʼll leave.
Visitors should always be one click away from home.
 - Web browsing has no sense of scale, no sense of direction, and no sense of location. 
Good navigation tells users what the site contains how to find it.
 - Use parent categories to group categories and to create an intuitive information architecture.
 
Site Name
 - Near the upper left corner
 - Site ID tells me Iʼm still on the site
 - Frames the entire page
 - Should look like a conventional ID (logo, distinctive visual, tagline)
 - Should click back to homepage

Sections (Primary Navigation)
 - Links to all the main sections of the site.
 - Should be across the top of the page (sometimes fixed)
 - Should be used for grouping
 - “You are here” visual indicator very important
 - On every page (except some key conversion pages)
 
Site Search
 - Appeals to search dominant users
 - “Search” or magnifying glass icon
 - Frame the box!
 - Autocomplete is great
 - Allow for common spelling errors
 
Utilities
 - Links to areas of the site that are not part of the main information architecture.
 - Sign in, register, shopping cart, about us, FAQʼs, sitemap, directory, store locator, jobs, order tracking, discussion forums etc.
 - Should be less visually prominent than other navigational elements.
 - Should be the only things above the logo.
 - Only include the most common utilities at the top - the rest go in the footer nav

Breadcrumbs
 - Easily gives visitors the ability to go back one level or go home
 - Bold or highlight the current level
 - “>” between levels (conventions)
 - The deeper the hierarchy the more useful breadcrumbs are

Page Title
 - On every page, framing the content of that specific page
 - Prominence - should be the largest text on the page
 - Gives visitors a subliminal sense of location

Footer Navigation
 - List of primary page links
 - Contact info
 - Additional site utilities
 - Social icons
 - Newsletter signup
 - Privacy policies
 - Sitemap

Accessibility
Contrast - Make sure you have lots of it.
Feedback - Things that make things happen should have something happen to them when interacted with.
Typography - Typography should go unnoticed 9/10 times. It shouldnʼt be something your visitors think about or even remember.
 - Avoid excessive capitalization
 - Avoid inverse color schemes (dark BG with light text)
 - Avoid multiple text colors
 - Donʼt underline text that isnʼt a link
 - Start with 14pt - increase a few points for an older audience
 - 50-100 character max line length
 

10 - Trust, Safety and Credibility (Part 1) Landing Page Design Best Practices
A users likelihood to convert is directly related to how trustworthy your site feels and appears
Trust and safety is an initial impression formed within a second or two of arriving on your landing page
Because websites lack the fidelity of a face to face relationship, there is a built in anxiety that you’re not trustworthy (guilty until
proven innocent)
Elements that increase trust are subliminal in nature and they’re hard for even users to pinpoint during a usability test
Run real world A/B tests to see improvements in conversion rate
Follow best practices blindly!

Professionalism and Refined Aesthetics
 - We do judge books by their covers
 - This is the hardest thing to get right, itʼs an overall sort of thing
 - Neatness, organization, high level of polish to your site all combine to create a sense of professionalism
 - Clean typography, white space, professional imagery

Transactional Assurances
 - Subtle design elements counteract innate anxiety
 - Equally important for lead generation and ecommerce
 - Needs to be prominent before the conversion action
 - Concerns and subliminal question marks about trust and safety never really go away

Guarantees and Policies
 - Refund policies should not be obscure, unclear or hidden
 - Does the company pay for return shipping?
 - You wonʼt use sell or use my email or phone number for any other purpose
 - Multiple payment methods and options
 - Price match guarantees

Safety Logos
 - If you think they are overrated, think again.
 - These logos are subconsciously expected
 - Relieves anxieties about entering payment methods
 - Include them above the fold and definitely in the checkout process whenever possible.

Clients and Media
 - Your visitors donʼt know you yet.
 - Awards / achievements
 - Media mentions
 - Partnerships
 - Studies and surveys
 - Client lists and logos
 

11 - Trust, Safety and Credibility (Part 2) Landing Page Design Best Practices
Social Identity and Customer Reviews
 - The decisions and tastes of our friends have a strong influence on our own consumer behaviors.
 - Objective numbers indicate leadership in a given space. Powerfully influential.
 - The more you identify with another, the more likely you are to be influenced by them.
 - The key to testimonials effect is to create a sense of identity.
 - If you can convey numbers with social identity then you win social proof.

12 - Dedicated Landing Page Design Best Practices (Part 1)
Landing pages usually have a distinctive style
For PPC and specific marketing dedicated landing pages are crucial
They center around one conversion action
Very important to capture attention immediately
Testing things is much easier

Clear Unmistakable Headlines
 - Headlines on landing pages server to capture attention immediately

Call to Action(CTA)

Remove Excess Text
 - You have very little time to capture attention
 - Highlight key benefits and features below the main headline
 - Answer your visitors primary questions
 - If you have paragraphs of copy they need to be shorter than main site paragraphs
 - No clutter, No yelling
 
Trust
 - Landing pages have an increase in anxiety

                    Section: 3 - Principles of Persuasion in Landing Page Design
1 - Using Scarcity to Improve Conversion Rates on Your Landing Pages
Concepts applicable in everyday life but very effective in marketing
Scarcity 
 - Creates a sense of urgency
 - People would rather make a quick decision than miss out
 - If people think that they can come back anytime they are unlikely to make a decision now
 - This can be applied in any context
 - Can be time or quantity driven
 - Do not overdo it
 
Use deadlines to create urgency
 - Does not have to be a hard deadline
 - Deadlines can be for seasonal products
 - Can be a coupon code for local services
 - Deadlines to register for webinar

Be specific & Be believable
Do not be atypical for your industry
Don't pretend

2 - Principles of Persuasion: Reciprocal Concessions & Reciprocity in Landing Pages
Very prevalent in negotiations
 - Reciprocal concessions are instances where you offer a product or service that’s too expensive (asking for too much) which the
   visitor refuses (you concede). He is more likely to concede to you on the cheaper option.
 - Reciprocity is a feeling of indebtedness caused by even small token gestures or gifts.

Youʼre Less Likely to Say “No” Twice
 - The requester lowers his initial request, making it more likely that the subsequent request is accepted.
 - Under the psychological contract of reciprocity, we should concede to someone else once theyʼve made a concession to us.
 - “Door In The Face Technique”. Your first price or package can be too expensive (almost surely rejected) and the second option will
   be more likely accepted
 - The first option canʼt be too unreasonable, otherwise the rejection of that option wonʼt be seen as a concession.

Reciprocal Concession Ideas
 - Email your prospects list with discounted prices based on previous offers
 - Create a second package with additional features not usually important to the majority of your customers
 - Yes / No Exit-intent popovers
 - Offer a paid signup, then a free trial

Reciprocal Concessions + Anchoring
 - In decision making, an anchor is the first or most prominent option presented
 - People have a tendency to rely heavily on an anchor, evaluating subsequent options within the context of that initial option
 - Commonly used with pricing
 - You can even something you really donʼt intend to ever sell
 - Good use of anchors allows you to convert more users for a higher profit than without the anchor

3 - Principles of Persuasion: Anchoring and Cognitive Dissonance Theory
Engendering Indebtedness
 - People want to return good will, even if it was a small, token gesture
 - By giving gifts or extending yourself to your visitors, you can engender goodwill and a sense or reciprocity
 - Chocolate / waiter study (2002)
 - Donʼt have strings attached, donʼt ask for anything in return
 - Free advice, free tools, trials, content previews, free resources, ebooks and white-papers, consultations, audits and
   additional perks are all gestures that will create a desire to reciprocate

Donʼt Underestimate the value of a Resource Library!

Cognitive Dissonance Theory Works Well With Reciprocity
 - People don't like living in contradictions they want their behaviors (past, current and future) and beliefs to be consistent
 - We will rationalize and behave in ways that will not contradict our previous behavior and efforts
 - You are more likely to be a client of mine than a stranger because of cognitive dissonance theory
 - The more a prospect engages with your website, the more likely they are to be committed to you for your paid services / products

Cognitive dissonance theory can be applied to headlines
Cognitive dissonance should always be applied with positivity making people feel good about themselves

4 - User Scenarios and Contextual Perception in Landing Page Design
EMPATHY
 - Persuasive techniques are only effective if youunderstand your visitors
 - A lot of what you think about your visitors is probably wrong
 - They’re often not the people you think they are
 - They do things differently than you’d think they would
 - They often times have different needs for your products than you think
 
CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS OF YOUR VISITORS
 - In order for you to truly enable your visitors to accomplish their tasks, you need to be aware of who they are.
 - What led them to your site?
 - How much knowledge do they have?
 - What are their anxieties?
 - What are their expectations?

Contextual Awareness: Understanding Your Audience
Who Are They?
 - Demographics, interest groups, affinity audiences. Visitors donʼt have name tags so you need to use aggregate data from analytics
 - Age, gender and ethnicity can have a major impact on your messaging and design aesthetics
 - On site behavior and conversion rate can vary greatly by demographic group

Where did they come from?
 - Different traffic sources bring in visitors in different stages in the funnel 
 - Social media tends to bring in curious, uncommitted, top of the funnel traffic (ads vs organic make a big difference)
 - PPC offers a lot of control and you should have a sense of who these people are
 - Organic offers less control, but your analytics can tell you which keywords youʼre ranking for
 - Email can bring in highly engaged traffic, but you should still have a sense of the demographics of your email lists

User Scenarios
 - Personas are the role of the person (small business owner), but scenarios also take into account the context of their visit.
 - What brought them to the site? What was their underlying concerns or fears? What are their desires and motivations?
 - Itʼs not just task oriented - different people will approach the same task differently.
 
Creating User Scenarios
 - Bring together anyone in the company who comes into contact with prospects (regardless of the stage of the prospect)
 - Each person (or just you) should write a brief description of the person (demographics)
 - Write a detailed role for your target: Who are they? What are their anxieties? How price conscious are they? 
 - Write a detailed intent: What are they trying to accomplish on your site? How do you imagine them accomplishing their desired task? 

Walk In Their Shoes
 - Go back to your landing pages with the user scenarios you and your team put together
 - Look for commonalities and trends (stage in the funnel, age, ethnicity, anxieties, motivations)
 - Assess your information architecture: are you providing the information that eases anxieties or answers questions
 - Close your eyes and imagine YOU are your visitor - what obstacles will you face, what questions will you have?
 - Come up with ways you can lay out the information and design the conversion path in a way that makes more sense to your visitors.
