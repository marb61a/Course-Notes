                    Section: 3 - Principles of Persuasion in Landing Page Design
1 - Using Scarcity to Improve Conversion Rates on Your Landing Pages
Concepts applicable in everyday life but very effective in marketing
Scarcity 
 - Creates a sense of urgency
 - People would rather make a quick decision than miss out
 - If people think that they can come back anytime they are unlikely to make a decision now
 - This can be applied in any context
 - Can be time or quantity driven
 - Do not overdo it
 
Use deadlines to create urgency
 - Does not have to be a hard deadline
 - Deadlines can be for seasonal products
 - Can be a coupon code for local services
 - Deadlines to register for webinar

Be specific & Be believable
Do not be atypical for your industry
Don't pretend

2 - Principles of Persuasion: Reciprocal Concessions & Reciprocity in Landing Pages
Very prevalent in negotiations
 - Reciprocal concessions are instances where you offer a product or service that’s too expensive (asking for too much) which the
   visitor refuses (you concede). He is more likely to concede to you on the cheaper option.
 - Reciprocity is a feeling of indebtedness caused by even small token gestures or gifts.

Youʼre Less Likely to Say “No” Twice
 - The requester lowers his initial request, making it more likely that the subsequent request is accepted.
 - Under the psychological contract of reciprocity, we should concede to someone else once theyʼve made a concession to us.
 - “Door In The Face Technique”. Your first price or package can be too expensive (almost surely rejected) and the second option will
   be more likely accepted
 - The first option canʼt be too unreasonable, otherwise the rejection of that option wonʼt be seen as a concession.

Reciprocal Concession Ideas
 - Email your prospects list with discounted prices based on previous offers
 - Create a second package with additional features not usually important to the majority of your customers
 - Yes / No Exit-intent popovers
 - Offer a paid signup, then a free trial

Reciprocal Concessions + Anchoring
 - In decision making, an anchor is the first or most prominent option presented
 - People have a tendency to rely heavily on an anchor, evaluating subsequent options within the context of that initial option
 - Commonly used with pricing
 - You can even something you really donʼt intend to ever sell
 - Good use of anchors allows you to convert more users for a higher profit than without the anchor

3 - Principles of Persuasion: Anchoring and Cognitive Dissonance Theory
Engendering Indebtedness
 - People want to return good will, even if it was a small, token gesture
 - By giving gifts or extending yourself to your visitors, you can engender goodwill and a sense or reciprocity
 - Chocolate / waiter study (2002)
 - Donʼt have strings attached, donʼt ask for anything in return
 - Free advice, free tools, trials, content previews, free resources, ebooks and white-papers, consultations, audits and
   additional perks are all gestures that will create a desire to reciprocate

Donʼt Underestimate the value of a Resource Library!

Cognitive Dissonance Theory Works Well With Reciprocity
 - People don't like living in contradictions they want their behaviors (past, current and future) and beliefs to be consistent
 - We will rationalize and behave in ways that will not contradict our previous behavior and efforts
 - You are more likely to be a client of mine than a stranger because of cognitive dissonance theory
 - The more a prospect engages with your website, the more likely they are to be committed to you for your paid services / products

Cognitive dissonance theory can be applied to headlines
Cognitive dissonance should always be applied with positivity making people feel good about themselves

4 - User Scenarios and Contextual Perception in Landing Page Design
EMPATHY
 - Persuasive techniques are only effective if youunderstand your visitors
 - A lot of what you think about your visitors is probably wrong
 - They’re often not the people you think they are
 - They do things differently than you’d think they would
 - They often times have different needs for your products than you think
