                     MODULE 4 - CLIENTS
                     Course Notes Part 2


4.7 - Prospecting 3 - Get Out There
Client prospecting method number 3
This is where you have got to gosomeone's place of business, and do a pitch. 
If you want people give you business on a recurring basis for SEO work as clients, you will need to meet with them at least
once.
First port of call is the Chamber of Commerce for the area, there maybe more than one in reach
Recommended that you join as they help get clients and authority links
If you join then be active as being active will more likely get you business
A lot of these chambers don't have any real SEOs
Use meetup sites - www.meetup.com and then a city
If there is none go ahead and you could start a meet up group
You will propbably need to buy products and services from people in the group yourself
Never get a repuation as the guy that pitches and never buys
If there's something that's being sold  that you would buy anyway, even if it costs a little bit more, buy it in your group
Business networking is another site
 - http://www.bni.ie
 - http://www.dublinbusinessnetwork.com
These are professionally organized networking groups, they usually have a fee
The main reason why this is good is because they only allow one business type per BNI chapter. 
This means that if you do internet marketing/search engine marketing, whatever, you are it. There's not going to be anyone
else in the group that they allow to sell that service.
With most BNI chapters you are required to be there a certain number of times, per month usually

 
4.8 - Follow The Money
Make sure that you have been doing the methods in the previous sections
One of the biggest hurdles to overcome initially when you are trying to sell SEO to clients is getting the buy-in
One of the most difficult things to do is to convince a business that there's going to a good ROI for investing in online marketing
If you have someone who's in their 20s, 30s, who controls the business finances, you're much more likely to close the deal 
on online
marketing than if the person who contros the finances is older, 50 plus. 
The ideal perfect prospect is someone who is already spending money on online marketing
https://www.spyfu.com - It allows you to see information on competitors

The ROI on an SEO, organic SEO, is just so much higher, but when you get to a certain point where you've maxed out organic, 
then you definitely want to start doing PPC
Use search engines to search for local businesses that are already paying for adverts

 
4.9 - Page 2
This is using companies that end up on page 2 of the SERP's
Companies on Page 2 may previously have been on Page 1
Don't think that just because someone's on the second page that they've never seen the first page
This is especially true if you're looking at positions eleven through thirteen. Those, typically will flip flop with 
positions eight through ten on page one if it's a ten result SERP
Traffic can be very low for page 2 sites
Multiple reasons for an organisation to be on Page 2 rather than Page 1
Depending on the niche don't ignore page three

 
4.10 - Pricing Intro
A quick introduction as there are a series of pricing videos

 
4.11 - Pricing Clients 1
It's important to have a logical method for determining what prices to charge for the services that we offer
Most clients are new to internet marketing and online marketing, and they don't really understand what you do and how you do it
It's very important you are able to make them clearly understand the value that you are bringing to their organisation
SEO is another business overhead, it's important to have some logic behind our pricing. 
One thing that you can do to asses your local market is just to go out and see what other SEOs are charging
Also visit some websites of some local SEO companies, or web design companies that offer internet marketing; some of them 
will have packages and prices right there on the website
One method of determining prices are going to be based on the cost-per-click value of the traffic in AdWords
The average person who is number one organically for Google is going to get roughly between 45-50% of the clicks on that page
You will always need to show an ROI to any potential customer eg a customer can pay you 40% of what AdWords PPC will cost
This method can be used in finding people who are getting Ads, who are paying for Ads, and converting them into organic.
The SEO methods should provide higher conversion rates and higher traffic volumes

 
4.12 - Pricing Clients 2
This example is going to use an industry standard formula
It's a very good rule of thumb to use to estimate, especially if there have lots of recurring.
The formula is average value of a sale times the number of repeated transactions times the average retention time in months 
or years
If this is an established business they are going to know this data
If they're not an established business then this is going to be more challenging and you will need a new method
A 1% conversion rate is actually fairly standard for more of an e-commerce type site.
But when you're looking at things like this, personal sites, it's actually much, much higher.

 
4.13 - Pricing Table
A one-off for those of you who are not familiar with the term is just simply an a la carte purchase
It's when someone purchases something from you one time instead of multiple times.
Ideally you want most of the time to be going for recurring revenue from our clients
Wordpress has pricing tables plugins available

4.14 - Low Volume Keywords
The main way that the author prices SEO is by using the AdWords value of the keywords, and then estimating traffic on that
A problem with that is when you have some niches just get very, very small volumes of keywords
There are other methods that you can use to price besides the AdWords or pay-per-click value

 
4.15 - Intro to Retention
The information is targeted toward the initial onboarding period - Approximately 2 Months
A long tail keyword is simply when we have a "money term or trophy term" but it is in a much longer version
Long tail keywords are not going to have the same volume in search and value as the trophy keyword, but they are much easier
to get. In the initial stages with our client we want to show them some proof that things are working that we are 
accomplishing things that things are getting done. We want to show them that we are working for their money. By ranking 
some of these long tail keywords this is a great way to start. 
The first thing that I like to do is I like to see what they are already ranking for long tail wise(if ranking at all)
