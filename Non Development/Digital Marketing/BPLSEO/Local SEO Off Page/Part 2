                                        Course Notes Part 2


2.2c - Citation Aggregators
Often when you take over a new client, a lot of their citation information is messed up.
A lot of them have duplicate listings, and they have information that's incorrect across multiple citation sources
If Yelp has duplicate entries for your business, then you will use the Yelp process for repairing that.
Top level aggregators
 - Infogroup -- http://www.expressupdate.com/search
 - Localeze -- https://www.neustarlocaleze.biz
 - Acxiom -- http://www.acxiom.com
 - Factual -- https://www.factual.com
 - Foursquare -- https://foursquare.com
Process is
 - You go and you setup your Google My Business page, and you give it a certain address.
 - Google goes out, and it looks on a top level aggregators  eg Localeze
 - And Localeze has a different address for that business. 
 - Google trusts Localeze a whole hell of a lot more than it trust you with a brand new Google My Business listing. 
 - Many times it will choose to use the information from Localeze. 
 - Google looks to these for citation information. 
You definitely want to be listed in these top five. 
Not being in the means that the visibility for this company is hampered right now. 
If it's not here, the business isn't in a significant number of databases or directory sites that it wants to be in. 

2.3a - Reviews Core
Reviews are going to have a much larger impact on your local rankings than they currently do.
This has to do a lot with how Google's moving more towards semantic search
The more positive, the better. However, negative ones don't actually hurt you normally
People do trust these reviews a lot
Ideally you would have 
 - 3-5 reviews on Google My Business
 - 2 or 3 on Yelp
 - 2 or 3 on Yahoo Local
 - 2 or 3 on Foursquare
Just like your citations, having all of these places reference your site is definitely a ranking factor
Reviews, will reinforce that you're a legitimate business
How do we get those reviews?
 - It's going to be employees, friends, and family.
 - Using other client accounts in order to leave a review for that business
 - Several different companies that can help you with this eg Get5Stars.com

2.3b - Reviews Schema
They are a significant part of ranking right now for local search
Anytime that you want to have something that you can mark up a schema, you should
These are a ranking factor and they are also a conversion factor
Author uses schema-creator.org - not available at the moment
Chosen the review schema because that's what is being dealt with
Google Structured Data Testing Tool - Tests to see if the review looks like its supposed to
Doing this for two reasons. 
 - Number one, we're doing it because this is a conversion element. When this shows up in the SERPs, this is going to be more highly 
   regarded, so it's much more like this one's going to click on it. 
 - Number Two, in general, whenever you use schema on your site when it makes sense, you want to use that. Again, not only does this 
   tell Google that you have reviews, which is a ranking factor, but the schema markup just gives it a little bit more trust as a 
   review.

2.4 - Web 2.0
4 main links
  - Facebook
  - Google Plus

  - Twitter

 Author again recommends using Fiverr
 Just use a bare link to your site, do not use anchor text

2.5 - Authority Links
Probably the most important part of this section.
Continuing with the theme of getting links that real businesses get
The one thing that Google hates more than anything else is spammers
Algorithm is to prevent people who shouldn’t be appearing in the SERPs from appearing in the SERPs
Google knows that if you have a Better Business Bureau link that you paid hundreds of dollars or more to get it
Spammers etc won't invest money needed
Having a Better Business Bureau link is a great thing for your site
If it’s a real business, it should be able to invest a couple of bucks in Better Business Bureau
The second in this list that we want to get is going to be Chamber of Commerce
Whenever possible, get both of those, if you can’t get both, at least get one.
Number three is going to be industry associations or professional organizations.
Industries will differ in their niches
Having both location and niche link isvery powerful
Fourth a legitimate edu domain link
Find out, where did you go to college, there’s one.
Law related professions can have association links

2.6 - Press Releases
Press releases have fallen out of favor with Google                    
On some level Google considers these to be kind of paid advertisements on one level or editorial type links
The basic elements of what you need to have for a safe press release.
 - Number one, the links that you put inside of your press release, those are going to be no-follow links. 
 - Number two, your links inside of your press release are going to be brand links

There's lots of good templates out there for writing good press releases, you can Google it if you need a basic one.
Another key to this, really, is, do a real press release
If you're having trouble with this, here's some things
 - We have a new website
 - A new member of our team
 - A new member of the executive team
 - We've added products or services
You are not going to get in trouble for real press releases

At the press release link,
 - You will have have the body that may or may not have links, 
 - Then you're going to have the resource box which is the part at the bottom that says basically "For information about this, contact 
   this person these ways" 
When you're doing the resource box it 
 - Should be a real person with 
 - A real phone number 
 - A real email address. 
 - Don't go making up fake material.
