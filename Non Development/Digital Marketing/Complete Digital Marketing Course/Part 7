1 - Project: Increase Your Twitter Followers with 10 Strategies
Home page - https://twitter.com
Twitter is a free microblogging platform that allows you publish Tweets that are 140 characters or less.
Twitter followers are the platforms equivalent of “Facebook Fans” and “YouTube Subscribers”. 
Gaining real and genuine Twitter followers enables you to become an influencer in your niche, build relationships and 
drive website traffic and sales on demand.

2 - Why Twitter?
 - 320 Million Active Monthly Users -- Twitter launched in 2006 and is an international powerhouse, with 79 percent of its users 
   living outside the US.
 - Connect With People You Don’t Know. -- Twitter a very open community. Almost all conversations are public and searchable.
   This allows you to discover new people with similar interests to yourself, and build relationships with influencers much easier
   than on Facebook and Linkedin.
 - Research -- News breaks faster on Twitter then anywhere else. Find news or links to industry-related articles, identify trending
   topics and use twitter search to tap into millions of opinions when creating new content.

Find out if Twitter is for you with this exercise
 - Go to Twitter search (no account required), type in your business keywords, topics or  competitors names.
 - If people are having conversation around these topics then Twitter is relevant for you!

3 - How Twitter Works
Twitter may not be as intuitive as Facebook, some things to remember about using twitter are
Twitter 140 character limit - Great for both audience and brand forces concise communication. 
Realtime News Feed - Your Twitter newsfeed is primarily sorted by chronological in order to enable real time conversation about a topic. 
A tweet you send will show up in all your followers accounts stream but only until it’s replaced by fresh content. Therefore, the real
filtering system is time and not the “post you are likely to care about” like on Facebook. What this means is that you have permission 
to tweet a lot. 
@mentions - A mention is a Tweet that contains another user’s @username anywhere in the body of the Tweet. If you include multiple
@usernames in your Tweet, all of those people will see your Tweet in their Notifications tab.
@replies - Send an at-reply to another Twitter user by hitting the Reply button on any tweet. Type your message into the box that pops up
and click Tweet. Your at-reply will show up in this person’s Interactions stream, which means it is more likely to be seen than a 
regular tweet.
Direct messages (DM’s) - If you don’t want anybody but the intended recipient to see your tweet, use a direct message. Click on the
message tabs at the top of your Twitter profile and create a new message. Once you submit it, it will appear in the recipient’s inbox.

4 - What Not To Do
There are a couple of things that you should not do on Twitter
Buying Twitter Followers - Numbers are not everything. What’s more important, 10,000 fans or followers, or 100 who will actually engage
with you?
Using Twitter Bots for Automated Follows & Direct Messages - Focus on having real conversations instead.

5 - 4 Ways To Get More Retweets
As much as possible you would like people to retweet you, some ways are 
Share original content - Everybody loves to be the first to retweet the new stuff. By reacting quickly to breaking news or creating
original content you will automatically increase your chances of being retweeted.
Always Include a Picture - Tweets with images generate 150 percent more retweets than text-only tweets. Upload it directly on to 
Twitter so it’s instantly visible in the timeline – don’t link to a third party photo host (i.e., Instagram) where it requires an 
extra click to be seen.
Ask - People often need a call to action. Simply asking for a retweet can generate 3-4 times the amount of engagement. Just add 
““please retweet” at the start or end of tweet.
Thank others for retweeting you - Let them know that you are aware and appreciative retweets via @replies.

6 - 5 Steps Optimize Your Profile
All Twitter accounts are created equal. There’s no difference between personal or professional account in terms extra features or
functionality like on Facebook.
Create an Account - https://twitter.com/
Twitter Handle - Keep it consistent across all social profiles.
Twitter Icon - Use a close up shot of your face or simple business logo.
Twitter Header Image - Get Sizes & Header Templates at Canva.com
Twitter Bio ideas - Your bio is the only place you have to tell people who you are.
