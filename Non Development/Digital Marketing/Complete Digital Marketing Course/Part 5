8 - YouTube Keyword Research
3 keyword research tools to find untapped video keywords:
 - YouTube’s Autocomplete Feature. (use private browsing so your search history doesn’t skew the suggestions)
 - Keyword Everywhere Chrome Extension
 - Google Keyword Planner

9 - YouTube Video Structure
*** Remember “watch time” is golden.

Search on Youtube yourself for ideas on what other people are searching for.

Follow this sequence exactly to maximise audience retention
 - Headline. Keyword Optimised. Show benefits compared to other videos in the search results.
 - Problem. The first 30 seconds is the most important. Identify the problem you will solve and visual stimuli to keep people interested.
 - Solution: The core of your video is the educational segment which provides the solution to the problem outlined.
 - Call To Action (CTA). End with a strong CTA, either to subscribe like comment or link back to your website. Use annotations, cards 
   and end templates.

10 - YouTube SEO
Key points to follow when you upload your video:
 - File name -- Include your target keyword e.g. seo-tutorial-for-beginners.mp4
 - Title -- Include your target keywords at the start of your title. Highlight benefits compared to other videos.
 - Description -- Summarise the content of your video in 200 words. Include keywords 3-4 times.
 - Video Tags -- Include your keyword as the first tag and a few related keywords as tags.
 - Closed Captioning -- Great for non native speakers, search, user experience and mobile viewers in sound sensitive environments.

11 - Youtube Thumbnails
Steps to create thumbnails:
 - Use custom thumbnails to stand out in the search results. 
 - Use solid background colors to catch viewers’ eye.
 - Add text -- Many viewers look at a thumbnail before they read the actual text title.
 - Thumbnail Size -- 1280px * 720 px. Make sure it looks good when it’s sized down.

12 - YouTube Annotations & Cards
Add cards and annotations to uploaded videos inside the YouTube Video Manager.
Use these to add 
 - text notes
 - promote a video or playlist
 - add links an approved website
 - promote another channel etc.

Cards - Allow viewers to click on CTA a mobile device (annotations don’t allow this). Teaser text appears in upper right corner of 
        the video for five seconds then reverts to “i” icon. Easily add images to videos without editing software. Limited to 5 per video

Annotations - Allows for flexible “spotlights” and pop-up locations. Can be any size and many colour schemes. However, they are not 
              mobile friendly and YouTube plans to phase this feature out.
