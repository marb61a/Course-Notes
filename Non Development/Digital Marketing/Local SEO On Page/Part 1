1.1 - Google Webmaster Tools
This section focuses on backend specifically in WordPress
Google webmaster tools - Now known as Google webmaster tools
A quick run through how to add your site to Google Search Console
Schema.org or structured data - a shorthand for Google Bot to understand what certain elements of your site are about. 
There are many ways to implement this on your site, by hand if you know the code, plug-ins can be used and tools. However 
ranking a local client especially having the correct type of schema data is very, very important and is a must do because
once Google Bot gets  to that page and then sees that schema data, it has a lot more trust with what that site says that 
it's about and it can match things up much more quickly.
If Google sees something as an issue and it's something that it keeps track of, then it is something that matters. Google 
did not pack this dashboard with stuff that does not matter to them. It's things that matter to them so it should matter to 
you.
