Course 05 - Creating the Social Media Policy 
An overview of common situations but there may need to be legal considerations taken into account in certain situations
so advice on those maybe needed from a qualified person.

A social media policy is a formal written document which outlines best practices for
 - Monitoring the results of social media outreach to ensure proper disclosure and truthfulness, including best practices 
    for good-faith efforts to attempt to correct misstatements and misrepresentations.
 - Ensuring that employees as well as social media vendors, agencies, and subcontractors that act on behalf of the company 
    act properly
 - Outlining how businesses should interact with external bloggers, social media sites, advocates, and other communities.
 - Ensuring truthfulness, disclosure and honesty in all social media communications, publications, and interactions.
It should be written with safeguaring the organisation in mind and also will serve as a reference point for incident response.

The Disclosure Best Practices Toolkit from SocialMedia.org is a series of checklists to help you create a social media policy for 
your company. It is now retired but still available here

In the US the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the federal government agency in the United States that protects consumers 
by stopping unfair, deceptive or fraudulent practices in the marketplace. Its Truth in Advertising regulations are most relevant
to social media activities and revolve around three basic principles
  - Endorsements must be truthful and not misleading
  - If the advertiser doesn’t have proof that an endorser’s experience represents what consumers will achieve by using the 
    product, the ad must clearly and conspicuously disclose the generally expected results in the depicted circumstances
  - If there’s a connection between the endorser and the marketer of the product that would affect how people evaluate 
    the endorsement, it should be disclosed

 - If employees post anything about your company's products online, they must identify themselves as employees of the company.
 - Stay up-to-date on regulations and regularly update your organizational policies and procedures. 
 - Perform periodic audits of your content and associated posts, including comments, for violations of regulations and organizational
   policies.
 - Educate all stakeholders who interact with social media so that know your organization's policies and regulations.

Intellactual Property (IP) has multiple definitions but the World Intellectual Property Organization defines it as refers to creations
of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
There are mechanisms in place to protect the inventor or creator of the IP, insuring that they are the only entities to receive 
recognition and financial benefit for their IP
 - A copyright © gives creators right to their literary and artistic works. 
 - A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention. 
 - A trademark ™is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one organization from those of other organizations.
Some examples from social media would be would be 
 - Original photographs posted by the photographer 
 - Music that is purchased and downloaded from an online store.
 
Sometimes on Social Media users can unknowingly use protected content eg reposting blog etc. Fair Use is a term which allows for the
use of copyrighted material. This does not usually apply to commercial cases as Fair Use does not allow for making a profit from the
violation of copyright. Many social media sites provide some license to share content in their terms of service. There are a couple
of ways in which to legally use protected content
 - Buy out the copyright owner’s rights completely 
 - Obtain a license to use the content

Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that facilitates free and easy-to-use copyright licenses that provide the public with a 
way to share and use protected content. The owner of the content can change copyright terms from “all rights reserved” to “some rights
reserved”. There are multiple licenses available which cover a wide spectrum of uses

There a couple of major types of Brand Abuse
Brandjacking - When someone deceptively hijacks a brand in order to sell products or conduct fraudulent activities. Consumers are 
tricked because they trust the real brand. One example is where a company makes a new type of cracker and puts a logo on the box 
that looks like the Nabisco logo.
Cybersquatting - The practice of abusing trademarks within the domain name system. Brand names—spelled correctly or, in a practice
known as typosquatting, spelled incorrectly—are used within a domain name, enabling the squatter to divert web traffic meant for a 
legitimate site to an illicit site which may sell counterfeit goods, utilize pay-per-click abuse, host adult content or conduct 
other illicit activity.

Trade secrets encompass all Information that is essential to the core business practices of organizations, such as the recipe and 
ingredients for a special pizza sauce or the process involved in manufacturing a high efficiency engine. Other entities are not
permitted to steal those secrets and use them for financial gain and laws protect trade secrets as long as the organization does a 
reasonable job keeping them secret.

Release of proprietary information or trade secrets can happen either accidentally or on purpose and damage an organization.
To avoid this problem there are steps that can be taken
 - Do not cross the line between giving the audience the “inside scoop” and divulging a trade secret.
 - Do not release customer lists or profile information.
 - Do not provide financial insights that could violate SEC rules.
 - Do not divulge the results of research data.
 - Do not share information about business deals.
 - Have a release manager review all content before it is posted.
 - Train the entire social media team on legal issues.

In many cases there are no specific regulations governing how social media sites must safeguard their data; however, release 
or abuse of privacy data can lead to bad press and public relations issues. An organisation should have a clear privacy policy 
that is enforced consistently, and all social media team members should be trained on the policy. Some things to consider are
 - Cookies used on websites, apps, etc
 - Data collection practices
 - Third-party data sharing
 - Protection of the data of minors (may differ in each jurisdiction)
 - Mobile data privacy

Defefimation is a legal term andis defined as a false, published statement that is injurious to the reputation of a person or
business.
There are 2 main types of defamation
 - Libel, or written defamation
 - Slander, or verbal defamation 
As Social Media is written in nature defamatory content would be libel, and there is always the possibility that inappropriate 
content will appear on your social media channels. Steps should be taken to avoid this issue
 - Create a clearly visible proper use policy that clearly states what is acceptable and what is not. 
 - Monitor comments and enforce the policy consistently. 
 - Create a Defamation Response Policy within your larger social media policy.
