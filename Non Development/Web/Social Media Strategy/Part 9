Course 11 - Providing Customer Service
Customer service is your organisation’s process for handling all customer issues, both good and bad. 
  - People like to talk about their good and bad experiences on social media because it’s built around shared experience.
  - Use social media to collect feedback and respond to customer service issues.
  - Plan to address feedback by using it as best as possible
    - Leveraging positive feedback
    - Looking for ways to turn neutral feedback positive
    - Mitigating negative feedback 
    
Create a social media triage response plan that maps out exactly

  - Who will handle it
  - What the nature of the response.
Ensure that the plan 
  - A consistent response methodology
  - Alignment with the organization's overall strategic goals
  - Maintenance of voice and empowerment for your staff

  - Speed -- Having a pre-determined response helps improve response time 
  - Smarts -- Gives staff the ability to make decisions on how to respond

Social Media provides customers with the opportunity to share their experiences both good and bad and give direct feedback
which among other things benefits the organisation as well as taking little time or investment by the organisation
Organsiations should
  - Plan for customer service feedback by coordinating the customer service and public relations teams.
  - Continue to monitor all interactions (you never know when sentiments can shift).
  - Leverage processes that already exist to respond to complaints and requests.
 
Good Customer Service rules for Social Media are exactly the same as in person
  - Do not get emotional.
  - Be courteous and take the high road in your responses.
  - Behave in a way that will positively reflect on your organization
It is wise to remember that Social Media is public and so your actions will be viewed by everyone
This may be difficult as there are different scenarios that Social Media Managers have to deal with
  - Positive, negative and neutral comments and experiences. 
  - Product defect or recall scenarios.
  - Requests to guest blog or accept customer content for the corporate blog or website. 
  - Breaches of policy. 

There are issues with online rather than inperson Customer Service
  - You can’t see body language or hear the tone of voice.
  - You can easily show anger.
  - Avoid criticizing others on social media.
  - Remember that, when you’re on social media, you’re in public. Behave appropriately.
Again treating the interaction no differently than one which occurs inperson should help remove some of these issues

There are different types of feedback in Social Media
Positive Feedback - This is highly valuable in the world of social media
  - Let your customer know that you’re listening by acknowledging the feedback 
  - Consider offering the person a perk the next time they come use your service or purchase your product. 
  - Share or promote the positive feedback so that others who might stumble upon your interaction will have a more positive view of 
    your brand
Negative Feedback (Non-Specific) - This type of Negative Feedback  could appear as a comment, a blog post, or any number of forms, and 
it is considered non-specificif it isn’t from a customer or someone who has directly experienced your brand.
  - To better inform your response, perform a detailed assessment: 
    - Is it a rant, a joke, or satirical in nature? 
    - Is it from a brand bashing (troll) site? 
    - Is it from a respected source, or is it anonymous feedback?
  - Review against acceptable use policy.
  - Respond (or do not respond) based on social media policy.
  - If you respond, consider moving the conversation off of social media. Sometimes it may be best to ask for more information, but 
    always attempt to resolve the underlying issue.
Negative Feedback (Specific) - Negative feedback from someone who has directly experienced your brand is considered specific
  - To better inform your response, perform a detailed assessment
    - What happened (who, what, when, where and why)?
    - Is this a legitimate customer service problem?
  - Review against acceptable use policy, social media policy and established customer service procedures. 
  - Engage with both the customer service team and the community member to find resolution.
  - If possible, move the conversation off of social media.
  - If the problem involves a product defect or recall or a breach of policy, inform legal, PR, HR, and management. 
Neutral or Other Feedback - Most neutral company mentions are from people looking for help and asking questions
  - Review, show interest, and post additional content to turn neutral interactions positive.
  - Engage and clarify issues and questions.
  - Contact internal resources to get answers for the community.
  - Continue to monitor.
 
Crisis Management - Managing a crisis that may occur means that you need to have the following in place
  - A crisis response team, including executives and other key individuals who can rapidly formulate responses and courses of action 
    regardless of the scenario.
  - A crisis response plan that includes a simple set of steps that the organization can follow in the event of a social media crisis 
    (persons to be contacted, actions to be taken, procedures to be followed).
  - A crisis training program that educates your entire crisis response team, especially social media community managers, on all 
    elements of the crisis response plan.
  - Develop generic holding messages that can be posted while the crisis response team is formulating a response, such as 
    - We are aware of the situation and take it very seriously. 
    - We have escalated the matter to the highest levels in the company and will publish a full response shortly.
 


Course 12 - Measuring, Analyzing and Reporting 
Social Media Analytics
Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics 
  - Analytics tools capture user activity on social media platforms, providing a wealth of statistics that can be analyzed to measure
    success or failure rates on things like campaigns etc.
  - The goal is to track specific, concrete actions visitors perform that can be measured to indicate that the social media campaign 
    is performing successfully.
  - The result is to identify if your website and social media campaigns are successful.

Social Media is not that old and as a result its impact on the organisation particularly financial can be difficult to measure.
This is because of several factors
  - There is no standard set of metrics
  - What to measure may vary by position or department 
    - Sales may want to measure lead generation 
    - Customer service may want to measure resolved complaints 
    - Social media team may want to measure number of fans or likes

You should perform social media audits on a regular basis in order to collect metric data.
  - Compare metrics with previous performance and chart progress
  - Compare metrics with competitors in your industry
  - Set a baseline for future measurement

There are a few different metrics that you can use to track your organisation

  - There are some metrics which can be used to measure Brand Health
    - Conversation share (brand mentions / (total mentions of brand + competitors) 
    - Amplification rate (how many people share your content) 
    - Applause rate (how many people like your content)
  - Use sentiment analysis to identify attitudes towards your brand
  - Use tools to review sentiment on 
    - Individual Social Media platforms
    - Across multiple platforms
    - Individual products or brand-related terms.
Customer Service Experience is a measurement of the customer service presence and activities across social media platforms
  - Key Metrics to be used
    - Volume (total number of serviceable inquiries) 
    - Response Time (time elapsed between all customer messages and agent replies)
    - Handling Time (time agents spend processing an issue)
  - Use tools to review sentiment on the customer service experience, including positive feedback, changes in sentiment, etc.
  - Consider analyzing the cost savings on call deflection from conventional customer service channels to social media platforms.

    - Number of total leads (people who might take the action you want, such as buying, downloading or registering)
    - Number of leads who took the desired action (actual conversions)
 
Calculating economic value will show the total investment and return on investment (ROI) for your organization.
  -  To calculate economic value
    - Use analytics data to find revenues generated from social media. 
    - Subtract costs of associated with social media activities

At the end of any social media campaign, you should perform an audit to collect data on the social media metrics that you’re tracking.
  - Compare the results to previous results
  - Track the progression in your social media metrics over time
  - Look for correlations between those metrics and your performance related to conversions and meeting your defined social media goals

Reports of social media performance (whether good or bad) are critical for evaluating the next round of social media activity.
  - Use to update key stakeholders, report ROI, and evaluate other details that will impact planning and execution
  - Use goal reports to see if you achieved your goals and to what degree

Course 13 - The Social Media Strategist Career
Salary will vary according to locations, some other factors that will influence it are
  - Supply and demand for social media services in your area
  - Your professional credentials and level of skill and quality
  - Relationships you have with other professionals
 
Working as an independent contractor can be another option, pricing work can be difficult and often different people will have 
different pricing, one standard method is
  - Hours * Rate) + Expense = Cost
Ensure that you thoroughly track and estimate all hours related to social media activities
Research your competition and what they charge

You can also place bids on projects which are typically on an hourly basis or a flat-rate basis.
Hourly bids are safer because you agree to work a set number of hours at a set hourly rate.
With a fixed rate bid you agree to perform a project to completion for a flat fee. This means that
  - Must have strong knowledge to properly estimate the time 
  - Limit your risk by being very specific about the hours spent on tasks 
  - Clearly state expectations, deliverables, and what you will and will not do as part of the contract
You should always create an action plan ahead of creating estimates to get a clearer idea of the tasks and hours involved and then 
create estimates from those action plans.

Social media initiatives are often part of larger and broader advertising or online initiatives, and it is impossible for one person 
to be an be an expert in everything which means that you will need to 
  - Build strong partnerships with trusted resources
  - Use partners that you know and trust to be responsive, do a good job, and make the client happy
  - Develop a referral network to work with partners you know
  - Create easy ways for you and your partners to refer opportunities to one another, such as LinkedIn or a job board
  - Ask for examples of a partner’s work as well as client references

An RFP is a Request For Proposal which is a document that you will build when you have a project and need some partners. There are 
several factors that need consideration including
  - Vendor qualities and qualifications 
  - Services, strategy, and reputation 
  - Content, community, and influencer outreach 
  - Client services and project management 
  - Evaluation tools, metrics, and channels

The key difference between a social media strategist and a successful social media strategist boils down to one word: results.
Some key things to remember are 
  - Stay on the cutting edge (update your skills)
  - Listen more than you talk (pay attention)
  - Abandon the failures quickly (be willing to shift gears)
  - Do nothing that you wouldn’t want to follow you forever (be cautious)
