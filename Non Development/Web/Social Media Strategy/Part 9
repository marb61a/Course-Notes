Course 11 - Providing Customer Service
Customer service is your organisation’s process for handling all customer issues, both good and bad. 
  - People like to talk about their good and bad experiences on social media because it’s built around shared experience.
  - Use social media to collect feedback and respond to customer service issues.
  - Plan to address feedback by using it as best as possible
    - Leveraging positive feedback
    - Looking for ways to turn neutral feedback positive
    - Mitigating negative feedback 
    
Create a social media triage response plan that maps out exactly
  - What you will respond to
  - Who will handle it
  - What the nature of the response.
Ensure that the plan 
  - A consistent response methodology
  - Alignment with the organization's overall strategic goals
  - Maintenance of voice and empowerment for your staff
Triage plans have many different benefits
  - Scalability -- Staff can be brought into the social media workflow more quickly with less direction 
  - Consistency -- Creates a consistent organizational voice and pattern of response 
  - Alignment -- Helps responses align with the organization's overall strategic goals 
  - Speed -- Having a pre-determined response helps improve response time 
  - Smarts -- Gives staff the ability to make decisions on how to respond

Social Media provides customers with the opportunity to share their experiences both good and bad and give direct feedback
which among other things benefits the organisation as well as taking little time or investment by the organisation
Organsiations should
  - Plan for customer service feedback by coordinating the customer service and public relations teams.
  - Continue to monitor all interactions (you never know when sentiments can shift).
  - Leverage processes that already exist to respond to complaints and requests.
 
Good Customer Service rules for Social Media are exactly the same as in person
  - Do not get emotional.
  - Be courteous and take the high road in your responses.
  - Behave in a way that will positively reflect on your organization
It is wise to remember that Social Media is public and so your actions will be viewed by everyone
This may be difficult as there are different scenarios that Social Media Managers have to deal with
  - Positive, negative and neutral comments and experiences. 
  - Product defect or recall scenarios.
  - Requests to guest blog or accept customer content for the corporate blog or website. 
  - Breaches of policy. 

There are issues with online rather than inperson Customer Service
  - You can’t see body language or hear the tone of voice.
  - You can easily show anger.
  - Avoid criticizing others on social media.
  - Remember that, when you’re on social media, you’re in public. Behave appropriately.
Again treating the interaction no differently than one which occurs inperson should help remove some of these issues

There are different types of feedback in Social Media
Positive Feedback - This is highly valuable in the world of social media
  - Let your customer know that you’re listening by acknowledging the feedback 
  - Consider offering the person a perk the next time they come use your service or purchase your product. 
  - Share or promote the positive feedback so that others who might stumble upon your interaction will have a more positive 
    view of your brand
Negative Feedback (Non-Specific) - This type of Negative Feedback  could appear as a comment, a blog post, or any number of 
forms, and it is considered non-specificif it isn’t from a customer or someone who has directly experienced your brand.
  - To better inform your response, perform a detailed assessment: 
    - Is it a rant, a joke, or satirical in nature? 
    - Is it from a brand bashing (troll) site? 
    - Is it from a respected source, or is it anonymous feedback?
  - Review against acceptable use policy.
  - Respond (or do not respond) based on social media policy.
  - If you respond, consider moving the conversation off of social media. Sometimes it may be best to ask for more information,
    but always attempt to resolve the underlying issue.
Negative Feedback (Specific) - Negative feedback from someone who has directly experienced your brand is considered specific
  - To better inform your response, perform a detailed assessment
    - What happened (who, what, when, where and why)?
    - Is this a legitimate customer service problem?
  - Review against acceptable use policy, social media policy and established customer service procedures. 
  - Engage with both the customer service team and the community member to find resolution.
  - If possible, move the conversation off of social media.
  - If the problem involves a product defect or recall or a breach of policy, inform legal, PR, HR, and management. 
Neutral or Other Feedback - Most neutral company mentions are from people looking for help and asking questions
  - Review, show interest, and post additional content to turn neutral interactions positive.
  - Engage and clarify issues and questions.
  - Contact internal resources to get answers for the community.
  - Continue to monitor.
 
Crisis Management - Managing a crisis that may occur means that you need to have the following in place
  - A crisis response team, including executives and other key individuals who can rapidly formulate responses and courses of 
    action regardless of the scenario.
  - A crisis response plan that includes a simple set of steps that the organization can follow in the event of a social media 
    crisis (persons to be contacted, actions to be taken, procedures to be followed).
  - A crisis training program that educates your entire crisis response team, especially social media community managers, 
    on all elements of the crisis response plan.
  - Develop generic holding messages that can be posted while the crisis response team is formulating a response, such as 
    - We are aware of the situation and take it very seriously. 
    - We have escalated the matter to the highest levels in the company and will publish a full response shortly.
