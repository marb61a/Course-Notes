Course 09 - Launching Successful Campaigns
Native advertising is advertising that is delivered in-stream and is targeted to the user, providing value through 
relevant content. 
Its benefits include
  - Looks the same as the other content on the site and offers something tangible to the consumer—generally related to 
    brand as well as the rest of the content on the site. 
  - Native ads are more likely to be viewed than banner ads, people are up tp 25% more likely to look at a native ad 
    than they are a banner ad.
  - Social media services that offer integrated paid social media advertising include Facebook, Google+, YouTube, 
    Twitter etc

All advertising should always be targeted, but social media is unique in this regard because once you target someone, 
you have the potential to access their friends, family and fans as well. This allows you to
  - Provide opportunities for your content to be promoted to fans and friends of fans
  - Work to extend your reach into the entire network of connections

One of the most successful methods to utilise this is Social Media Contests 
  - Create contests that require people to perform a simple action.
  - Offer prizes of interest to your target customers.
  - Engage in a way they will see as enjoyable.
  - Follow the rules for contests and sweepstakes on each platform.
  - Consider using social media contest software tools

Document all aspects of each social media marketing campaign, including tasks, time it took to complete each task and 
any lessons learned along the way. Thiis reduces wasted time reinventing processes, increases efficiency, makes it 
easier to repeat tasks,encourages consistency in approach and quality and helps in training new team members. 
Examples include
  - Action Plans -- This is a written document that clearly details the following
    - Steps that need to occur 
    - Amount of time needed to complete the steps 
    - Resources needed to carry out the steps 
    - Person responsible for carrying out the actions for the steps 
    - Date by which the steps must be completed
  - Editorial Calendar -- This is used to plan, execute, and maintain consistency and quality in your content and delivery.
    - Detail the content delivery platform, when content will be delivered, and the topic of the content
    - Better than ad-hoc posting, release content consistently
    - Plan your calendar content well ahead of the publication time
  - Project Management Software -- Example Microsoft Project, allows you to track multiple projects and track the following 
    details
    - Tasks, estimated task durations and milestones
    - Resources (people, supplies, equipment, etc.)
    - Task assignments
    - Costs
    - Timelines and deadlines
    - Project management software offers powerful reports.
Dozens of vendors offer performance dashboard tools, some examples include SumAll, Geckoboard and Socialbakers each of 
these will have broadly the same range of tools. As with Social Media Management tools the key is to put together a 
list of features that you need and then select the most suitable.
