Course 12 - Measuring, Analyzing and Reporting 
Social Media Analytics
Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics 
  - Analytics tools capture user activity on social media platforms, providing a wealth of statistics that can be analyzed to 
    measure success or failure rates on things like campaigns etc.
  - The goal is to track specific, concrete actions visitors perform that can be measured to indicate that the social media
    campaign is performing successfully.
  - The result is to identify if your website and social media campaigns are successful.

Social Media is not that old and as a result its impact on the organisation particularly financial can be difficult to measure.
This is because of several factors
  - There is no standard set of metrics
  - What to measure may vary by position or department 
    - Sales may want to measure lead generation 
    - Customer service may want to measure resolved complaints 
    - Social media team may want to measure number of fans or likes

You should perform social media audits on a regular basis in order to collect metric data.
  - Compare metrics with previous performance and chart progress
  - Compare metrics with competitors in your industry
  - Set a baseline for future measurement

There are a few different metrics that you can use to track your organisation
Brand Health which is measurement of the brand’s presence across social media channels and its audience talks, feels and acts 
toward it.
  - There are some metrics which can be used to measure Brand Health
    - Conversation share (brand mentions / (total mentions of brand + competitors) 
    - Amplification rate (how many people share your content) 
    - Applause rate (how many people like your content)
  - Use sentiment analysis to identify attitudes towards your brand
  - Use tools to review sentiment on 
    - Individual Social Media platforms
    - Across multiple platforms
    - Individual products or brand-related terms.
Customer Service Experience is a measurement of the customer service presence and activities across social media platforms
  - Key Metrics to be used
    - Volume (total number of serviceable inquiries) 
    - Response Time (time elapsed between all customer messages and agent replies)
    - Handling Time (time agents spend processing an issue)
  - Use tools to review sentiment on the customer service experience, including positive feedback, changes in sentiment, etc.
  - Consider analyzing the cost savings on call deflection from conventional customer service channels to social 
    media platforms.
Conversions are the actions that  indicate you have won a customer or an order. 
  - Key Metics to use are
    - Number of total leads (people who might take the action you want, such as buying, downloading or registering)
    - Number of leads who took the desired action (actual conversions)
 
Calculating economic value will show the total investment and return on investment (ROI) for your organization.
  -  To calculate economic value
    - Use analytics data to find revenues generated from social media. 
    - Subtract costs of associated with social media activities

At the end of any social media campaign, you should perform an audit to collect data on the social media metrics that 
you are tracking.
  - Compare the results to previous results
  - Track the progression in your social media metrics over time
  - Look for correlations between those metrics and your performance related to conversions and meeting your defined social
    media goals

Reports of social media performance (whether good or bad) are critical for evaluating the next round of social media activity.
  - Use to update key stakeholders, report ROI, and evaluate other details that will impact planning and execution
  - Use goal reports to see if you achieved your goals and to what degree
  - Look for relationships between goals and social media interactions
  - Create goal reports manually, or from tools such as Google Analytics
  - Perform a SWOT analysis to find strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities in your social media activities



Course 13 - The Social Media Strategist Career
Salary will vary according to locations, some other factors that will influence it are
  - Supply and demand for social media services in your area
  - Your professional credentials and level of skill and quality
  - Relationships you have with other professionals
 
Working as an independent contractor can be another option, pricing work can be difficult and often different people will have 
different pricing, one standard method is
  - Hours * Rate) + Expense = Cost
Ensure that you thoroughly track and estimate all hours related to social media activities
Research your competition and what they charge

You can also place bids on projects which are typically on an hourly basis or a flat-rate basis.
Hourly bids are safer because you agree to work a set number of hours at a set hourly rate.
With a fixed rate bid you agree to perform a project to completion for a flat fee. This means that
  - Must have strong knowledge to properly estimate the time 
  - Limit your risk by being very specific about the hours spent on tasks 
  - Clearly state expectations, deliverables, and what you will and will not do as part of the contract
You should always create an action plan ahead of creating estimates to get a clearer idea of the tasks and hours involved and 
then create estimates from those action plans.

Social media initiatives are often part of larger and broader advertising or online initiatives, and it is impossible for one 
person to be an be an expert in everything which means that you will need to 
  - Build strong partnerships with trusted resources
  - Use partners that you know and trust to be responsive, do a good job, and make the client happy
  - Develop a referral network to work with partners you know
  - Create easy ways for you and your partners to refer opportunities to one another, such as LinkedIn or a job board
  - Ask for examples of a partner’s work as well as client references

An RFP is a Request For Proposal which is a document that you will build when you have a project and need some partners. 
There are several factors that need consideration including
  - Vendor qualities and qualifications 
  - Services, strategy, and reputation 
  - Content, community, and influencer outreach 
  - Client services and project management 
  - Evaluation tools, metrics, and channels

The key difference between a social media strategist and a successful social media strategist boils down to one word: results.
Some key things to remember are 
  - Stay on the cutting edge (update your skills)
  - Listen more than you talk (pay attention)
  - Abandon the failures quickly (be willing to shift gears)
  - Do nothing that you wouldn’t want to follow you forever (be cautious)
