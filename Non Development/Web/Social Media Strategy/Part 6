Blogging
A blog allows you to post articles and other rich media content to promote products, services, and ideas in order to establish 
relationships with clients and credibility within an industry. 
If you are considering writing a blog, ask some questions like

   - How well-established is the platform provider?
   - What type of media will the platform support?  
   - How customizable is the platform? 
   - Does the platform support mobile? 
The main example of a bloggin platform is WordPress

Facebook
Facebook is a social networking platform for connecting and sharing with friends and family it is the world's largest social network.
  - Other websites have worked to integrate Facebook, which means you can use a single Facebook account to sign in to different services.
  - Facebook allows you to send messages, post status updates, and share different types of content such as photos or links.
  - While Facebook offers privacy tools to help you limit who can see the things you share, it is designed to be more open and 
    social than traditional communication tools. 

YouTube
YouTube is a video sharing website and is owned by Google that allows users to upload, view and share video clips, TV clips, music 
videos, video blogs, and educational videos.
  - If you have a Google account, a YouTube account will be ready to go. If you don’t have a Google account, signing up for one is easy.
  - If you want to follow a favorite band, news organization or other great channel, you can subscribe so that the channel is added to 
    your guide. The content from that channel will appear in the MySubscriptionsfeed.
  - You can navigate to the My Subscriptions view at any time and see what’s new from the channels you love. This list is viewable on 
    the homepage, on the watch page, and on mobile and device

Google+
Google+ is now one of the most popular platforms with nearly 300 million users. 
  - The most popular products that Google built into the platform are Hangouts and Communities, along with its added integration 
    in Google News.
  - In order to have a Google+ account, you must have a Google account. The first time you access Google+, you are prompted to add 
    people you know or want to follow, as well as a list of suggested users Google has curated for you to follow —also known as a Circle.
  - You can follow someone and see all the activity that he or she publishes publicly. When you want to add someone to a Circle, there
    are already four default Circles you can choose from: "Family," "Friends," "Acquaintances" and "Following.“ You can also create 
    your own Circles.

LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social network for business professionals and is designed specifically for professional networking – finding a job, 
generating sales leads, connecting with potential business partners. 
  - A study by HubSpot indicated LinkedIn was 277 percent more effective at lead generation than Facebook or Twitter.
  - LinkedIn supports the formation of interest groups, and there are more than 2 million available for everything from professional 
    and career issues to academic and corporate alumni.
  - LinkedIn allows users to endorse each other's skills and to provide commentary on other users profiles. However there is no way of 
    flagging anything other than positive content.

Twitter
Twitter is a microblogging information network that consists of 140-character messages called Tweets.
  - Messages from users you choose to follow show up on your home page in a constant feed, making it easy to read news as it’s 
    happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time.
  - Some people find it useful to contribute their own Tweets, but you can opt to just absorb real-time information that matters to you.
 


Course 09 - Launching Successful Campaigns
Native advertising is advertising that is delivered in-stream and is targeted to the user, providing value through relevant content. 
Its benefits include
  - Looks the same as the other content on the site and offers something tangible to the consumer—generally related to brand as well as 
    the rest of the content on the site. 
  - Native ads are more likely to be viewed than banner ads, people are up tp 25% more likely to look at a native ad than they are a 
    banner ad.
  - Social media services that offer integrated paid social media advertising include Facebook, Google+, YouTube, Twitter etc

All advertising should always be targeted, but social media is unique in this regard because once you target someone, you have the 
potential to access their friends, family and fans as well. This allows you to
  - Provide opportunities for your content to be promoted to fans and friends of fans
  - Work to extend your reach into the entire network of connections

One of the most successful methods to utilise this is Social Media Contests 
  - Create contests that require people to perform a simple action.
  - Offer prizes of interest to your target customers.
  - Engage in a way they will see as enjoyable.
  - Follow the rules for contests and sweepstakes on each platform.
  - Consider using social media contest software tools

Document all aspects of each social media marketing campaign, including tasks, time it took to complete each task and any lessons 
learned along the way. Thiis reduces wasted time reinventing processes, increases efficiency, makes it easier to repeat tasks,
encourages consistency in approach and quality and helps in training new team members. Examples include
  - Action Plans -- This is a written document that clearly details the following
    - Steps that need to occur 
    - Amount of time needed to complete the steps 
    - Resources needed to carry out the steps 
    - Person responsible for carrying out the actions for the steps 
    - Date by which the steps must be completed
  - Editorial Calendar -- This is used to plan, execute, and maintain consistency and quality in your content and delivery.
    - Detail the content delivery platform, when content will be delivered, and the topic of the content
    - Better than ad-hoc posting, release content consistently
    - Plan your calendar content well ahead of the publication time
  - Project Management Software -- Example Microsoft Project, allows you to track multiple projects and track the following details
    - Tasks, estimated task durations and milestones
    - Resources (people, supplies, equipment, etc.)
    - Task assignments
    - Costs
    - Timelines and deadlines
    - Project management software offers powerful reports.
Dozens of vendors offer performance dashboard tools, some examples include SumAll, Geckoboard and Socialbakers each of these will have
broadly the same range of tools. As with Social Media Management tools the key is to put together a list of features that you need
and then select the most suitable.



Course 10 - Managing the Community
A community manager responsibilities lie in advocating the brand on social media networks. They create their own social persona and 
actively and passionately engage the online community to advocate the brand by 
  - fielding questions
  - participating in conversations
  - posting additional content.
There should be established guidelines on how you want community managers to interact with the community
Majority of time should be spent listening.
Determine policies for how much personalization will be allowed and whether or not all communications should follow a predefined pattern
The main thing to remember is when managing a community that there is no one size fits all scenario

Social Media Personas
There are 3 Social Media Personas
Personal Persona
  - Social media actors post as themselves, creating a personal touch
  - There can be challenges to be overcome including
    - People need to be trained and managed 
    - Activities must be monitored for message continuity 
    - People may leave the organisation and take followers with them
Corporate Persona
  - Social media actors post as the organisation, avoiding any personal identification
  - Organisations can gain benefits from this including
    - A central voice speaks with authority for the organisation 
    - Activities remain focused on corporate issues and don’t stray into personal topics 
    - The organisation’s social media activities are insulated from employee turnover
Response Community Persona
  - Many social media actors post on behalf of the organisation.
  - There can be benefits from the hybrid approach including
    - Activities come under one account, but the voices aren’t identical 
    - Personality and a personal approach develops in the midst of maintaining brand continuity

Oganisations should have a consistent approach to how they respond and react in conversations.
  - Consistency lets community members become familiar with response patterns and more comfortable with establishing a relationship
  - Should show individual personalities during engagement, but maintain a consistent voice
  - Leverage work done by your public relations team in customer service situations, public announcements, and press releases

  - Show genuine interest (listen more than anything else)
  - Show honest and sincere appreciation and make others feel important
  - Arouse interest through storytelling
  - Speak to the interests of the audience and encourage others to share about themselves



Course 11 - Providing Customer Service
Customer service is your organisation’s process for handling all customer issues, both good and bad. 
  - People like to talk about their good and bad experiences on social media because it’s built around shared experience.
  - Use social media to collect feedback and respond to customer service issues.
  - Plan to address feedback by using it as best as possible
    - Leveraging positive feedback
    - Looking for ways to turn neutral feedback positive
    - Mitigating negative feedback 
    
Create a social media triage response plan that maps out exactly
  - What you will respond to
  - Who will handle it
  - What the nature of the response.
Ensure that the plan 
  - A consistent response methodology
  - Alignment with the organization's overall strategic goals
  - Maintenance of voice and empowerment for your staff
Triage plans have many different benefits
  - Scalability -- Staff can be brought into the social media workflow more quickly with less direction 
  - Consistency -- Creates a consistent organizational voice and pattern of response 
  - Alignment -- Helps responses align with the organization's overall strategic goals 
  - Speed -- Having a pre-determined response helps improve response time 
  - Smarts -- Gives staff the ability to make decisions on how to respond

Social Media provides customers with the opportunity to share their experiences both good and bad and give direct feedback
which among other things benefits the organisation as well as taking little time or investment by the organisation
Organsiations should
  - Plan for customer service feedback by coordinating the customer service and public relations teams.
  - Continue to monitor all interactions (you never know when sentiments can shift).
  - Leverage processes that already exist to respond to complaints and requests.
 
Good Customer Service rules for Social Media are exactly the same as in person
  - Do not get emotional.
  - Be courteous and take the high road in your responses.
  - Behave in a way that will positively reflect on your organization
It is wise to remember that Social Media is public and so your actions will be viewed by everyone
This may be difficult as there are different scenarios that Social Media Managers have to deal with
  - Positive, negative and neutral comments and experiences. 
  - Product defect or recall scenarios.
  - Requests to guest blog or accept customer content for the corporate blog or website. 
  - Breaches of policy. 

There are issues with online rather than inperson Customer Service
  - You can’t see body language or hear the tone of voice.
  - You can easily show anger.
  - Avoid criticizing others on social media.
  - Remember that, when you’re on social media, you’re in public. Behave appropriately.
Again treating the interaction no differently than one which occurs inperson should help remove some of these issues

There are different types of feedback in Social Media
Positive Feedback - This is highly valuable in the world of social media
  - Let your customer know that you’re listening by acknowledging the feedback 
  - Consider offering the person a perk the next time they come use your service or purchase your product. 
  - Share or promote the positive feedback so that others who might stumble upon your interaction will have a more positive view of 
    your brand
Negative Feedback (Non-Specific) - This type of Negative Feedback  could appear as a comment, a blog post, or any number of forms, and 
it is considered non-specificif it isn’t from a customer or someone who has directly experienced your brand.
  - To better inform your response, perform a detailed assessment: 
    - Is it a rant, a joke, or satirical in nature? 
    - Is it from a brand bashing (troll) site? 
    - Is it from a respected source, or is it anonymous feedback?
  - Review against acceptable use policy.
  - Respond (or do not respond) based on social media policy.
  - If you respond, consider moving the conversation off of social media. Sometimes it may be best to ask for more information, but 
    always attempt to resolve the underlying issue.
Negative Feedback (Specific) - Negative feedback from someone who has directly experienced your brand is considered specific
  - To better inform your response, perform a detailed assessment
    - What happened (who, what, when, where and why)?
    - Is this a legitimate customer service problem?
  - Review against acceptable use policy, social media policy and established customer service procedures. 
  - Engage with both the customer service team and the community member to find resolution.
  - If possible, move the conversation off of social media.
  - If the problem involves a product defect or recall or a breach of policy, inform legal, PR, HR, and management.

  - Review, show interest, and post additional content to turn neutral interactions positive.
  - Engage and clarify issues and questions.
  - Contact internal resources to get answers for the community.
  - Continue to monitor.
 
Crisis Management - Managing a crisis that may occur means that you need to have the following in place
  - A crisis response team, including executives and other key individuals who can rapidly formulate responses and courses of action 
    regardless of the scenario.
  - A crisis response plan that includes a simple set of steps that the organization can follow in the event of a social media crisis 
    (persons to be contacted, actions to be taken, procedures to be followed).
  - A crisis training program that educates your entire crisis response team, especially social media community managers, on all 
    elements of the crisis response plan.
  - Develop generic holding messages that can be posted while the crisis response team is formulating a response, such as 
    - We are aware of the situation and take it very seriously. 
    - We have escalated the matter to the highest levels in the company and will publish a full response shortly.
 


Course 12 - Measuring, Analyzing and Reporting 
Social Media Analytics
Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics 
  - Analytics tools capture user activity on social media platforms, providing a wealth of statistics that can be analyzed to measure
    success or failure rates on things like campaigns etc.
  - The goal is to track specific, concrete actions visitors perform that can be measured to indicate that the social media campaign 
    is performing successfully.
  - The result is to identify if your website and social media campaigns are successful.

Social Media is not that old and as a result its impact on the organisation particularly financial can be difficult to measure.
This is because of several factors
  - There is no standard set of metrics
  - What to measure may vary by position or department 
    - Sales may want to measure lead generation 
    - Customer service may want to measure resolved complaints 
    - Social media team may want to measure number of fans or likes

You should perform social media audits on a regular basis in order to collect metric data.
  - Compare metrics with previous performance and chart progress
  - Compare metrics with competitors in your industry
  - Set a baseline for future measurement

There are a few different metrics that you can use to track your organisation
Brand Health which is measurement of the brand’s presence across social media channels and its audience talks, feels and acts toward it.
  - There are some metrics which can be used to measure Brand Health
    - Conversation share (brand mentions / (total mentions of brand + competitors) 
    - Amplification rate (how many people share your content) 
    - Applause rate (how many people like your content)
  - Use sentiment analysis to identify attitudes towards your brand
  - Use tools to review sentiment on 
    - Individual Social Media platforms
    - Across multiple platforms
    - Individual products or brand-related terms.
Customer Service Experience is a measurement of the customer service presence and activities across social media platforms
  - Key Metrics to be used
    - Volume (total number of serviceable inquiries) 
    - Response Time (time elapsed between all customer messages and agent replies)
    - Handling Time (time agents spend processing an issue)
  - Use tools to review sentiment on the customer service experience, including positive feedback, changes in sentiment, etc.
  - Consider analyzing the cost savings on call deflection from conventional customer service channels to social media platforms.
Conversions are the actions that  indicate you have won a customer or an order. 
  - Key Metics to use are
    - Number of total leads (people who might take the action you want, such as buying, downloading or registering)
    - Number of leads who took the desired action (actual conversions)
 
Calculating economic value will show the total investment and return on investment (ROI) for your organization.
  -  To calculate economic value
    - Use analytics data to find revenues generated from social media. 
    - Subtract costs of associated with social media activities

At the end of any social media campaign, you should perform an audit to collect data on the social media metrics that you’re tracking.
  - Compare the results to previous results
  - Track the progression in your social media metrics over time
  - Look for correlations between those metrics and your performance related to conversions and meeting your defined social media goals

Reports of social media performance (whether good or bad) are critical for evaluating the next round of social media activity.
  - Use to update key stakeholders, report ROI, and evaluate other details that will impact planning and execution
  - Use goal reports to see if you achieved your goals and to what degree
  - Look for relationships between goals and social media interactions
  - Create goal reports manually, or from tools such as Google Analytics
  - Perform a SWOT analysis to find strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities in your social media activities



Course 13 - The Social Media Strategist Career
Salary will vary according to locations, some other factors that will influence it are
  - Supply and demand for social media services in your area
  - Your professional credentials and level of skill and quality
  - Relationships you have with other professionals
 
Working as an independent contractor can be another option, pricing work can be difficult and often different people will have 
different pricing, one standard method is
  - Hours * Rate) + Expense = Cost
Ensure that you thoroughly track and estimate all hours related to social media activities
Research your competition and what they charge

You can also place bids on projects which are typically on an hourly basis or a flat-rate basis.
Hourly bids are safer because you agree to work a set number of hours at a set hourly rate.
With a fixed rate bid you agree to perform a project to completion for a flat fee. This means that
  - Must have strong knowledge to properly estimate the time 
  - Limit your risk by being very specific about the hours spent on tasks 
  - Clearly state expectations, deliverables, and what you will and will not do as part of the contract
You should always create an action plan ahead of creating estimates to get a clearer idea of the tasks and hours involved and then 
create estimates from those action plans.

Social media initiatives are often part of larger and broader advertising or online initiatives, and it is impossible for one person 
to be an be an expert in everything which means that you will need to 
  - Build strong partnerships with trusted resources
  - Use partners that you know and trust to be responsive, do a good job, and make the client happy
  - Develop a referral network to work with partners you know
  - Create easy ways for you and your partners to refer opportunities to one another, such as LinkedIn or a job board
  - Ask for examples of a partner’s work as well as client references

An RFP is a Request For Proposal which is a document that you will build when you have a project and need some partners. There are 
several factors that need consideration including
  - Vendor qualities and qualifications 
  - Services, strategy, and reputation 
  - Content, community, and influencer outreach 
  - Client services and project management 
  - Evaluation tools, metrics, and channels

The key difference between a social media strategist and a successful social media strategist boils down to one word: results.
Some key things to remember are 
  - Stay on the cutting edge (update your skills)
  - Listen more than you talk (pay attention)
  - Abandon the failures quickly (be willing to shift gears)
  - Do nothing that you wouldn’t want to follow you forever (be cautious)
