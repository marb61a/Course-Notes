                    30 Days of JQuery
                    
                    

                    Section 1.Introduction
1 - Welcome
A welcome to the course from the instructor



                    Section 2.The Basics
1 - Hello jQuery
A couple of different ways of using JQuery
  - http://jquery.com/download/
  - There are a couple of different options available
    - Production which contains minified\compressed cod
    - Development which contains unchanged source code
  - CDN -- Content Delivery Network
    - https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/
    - https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
Author uses Sublime Editor as his tool
Author also Chrome Developer Tools
You should be familiar with some CSS & HTML and maybe some familiarity with Javascript
You should place the JQuery script at the end of the body to make the page appear quicker loading
Paths to scripts either in local environment or via CDN are entered between script tags
Example using JQuery & CSS selectors to query the dom
Alays try to keep syles within stylesheets
JQuery shorthand is $

2 - Not So Fast, jQuery
JQuery .ready() method
You may need to load JQuery in the head of your file
You should not try working with the DOM before it has been loaded
The DOM unless modified will be loaded top to bottom
Ensuring DOM is ready syntax
  $(document).ready(function(){})
  // You can omit the document word in shorthand
  $(function(){})
A lot of people use the first option for its readability
Under the hood JQuery will check every few milliseconds to see if the DOM is ready

3 - The Basics of Querying the DOM
Using JQuery to query the DOM
  - Syntax
    <script>
      $('ul')
    </script>
Using children
  - Syntax
    <script>
    // Direct child not all children are direct
    // More information on  inheritance https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/sel_parent_descendant.asp
      $('ul').children('li')
    </script>
Using find method will continue searching unlike children
The rule of thumb is to use the children method when you are only looking for direct children
Performance difference between find and children if you are unsure of ancestry is negligible
:first is a JQuery method for selecting the first child
Use CSS selectors if possible to use native CSS support in the browser
JQuery is very good for chaining methods but do not make it too complicated
JQuery is very natural with methods which are self explanatory
  - next
  - prev
  - first
Use indentation to improve readability it does not affect functionality
parent() refers to direct parent but parents() will use multiple parents
closest() gets the first element that matches the selector
parents() and closest() are broadly similar but parents() will continue up the DOM
