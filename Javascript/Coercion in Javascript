                    Section 1 - Primitive Types
1 - Introduction
Brief introduction to the instructor & course
The author feels that coercion could be a very useful feature of Javascript

2 - Additonal Resources
There are some additional resources recommended by the instructor
  - High Performance Javascript By Nicholas Zekas (some parts maybe outdated)
  - Javascript Patterns By Stoyan Stefanov

There is a lot more to coercion than == (double equals) and it occurs much more often than thought
Null and undefined are coercively equal to each other
ES6 is almost a new language

3 - Primitive Types
Javascript is said to be a no-type language like a lot of other scripting languages
  - This is a false assumption in the main
The type that are listed in the JS specifications are
  - Undefined
  - String
  - Number 
  - Boolean 
  - Object
  - function
  - null
There are different intrinsic behaviours in each of these
There are two many types of conversion implicit and explicit
Not everything in JS are objects
In ES6 null will function differently than undefined especially as function parameters
