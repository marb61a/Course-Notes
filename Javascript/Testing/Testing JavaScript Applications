                    Testing JavaScript Applications
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
Brief introduction to the course and the author
What the workshop is and is not
  - It uses a real world application for testing
  - It covers the why, how, where and what to test
  - There are comparisons of the various forms of testing
  - A demonstration of the Jest & Cyprus tooling setup
  - Writing unit and integration tests for Express
  - Writing unit and integration tests for React
  - Writing E2E tests for the entire application
  - There will be tradoffs no matter what testing is being done
  - The course will not cover all forms of testing
  - It is a very practical course and not too focused on single tech specifics (too much)

2 - Bugs and How to Stop Them
Multiple different types of bugs
  - Security, performance, UI, Accessibility etc
A brief discussion of infamous bugs
  - Heartbleed etc
There are ways to prevent bugs
  - Use static typing -- Typescript, Flow
  - Linting -- ESLint
There are also multiple kinds of testing that can be done on applications

3 - Types of Tests
What is a unit test
  - It is a test for a function/small piece of code
  - It is also a good reason for writing code this way too
What is an Integration Test
  - It is a test of how multiple units work together
What is an End-To-End Test
  - No mocking and automate a test which tests the application like a user would
  - Sometimes called flow based testing

4 - Setting up Application
The sample app to be used is readworld.io
  - https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld
  - There are multiple implementations available in frontend and backend
  - The course will focus on the React version
  - The app is similar to medium which is basically a blog based system
