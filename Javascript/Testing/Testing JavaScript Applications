Brief introduction to the course and the author
What the workshop is and is not
  - It uses a real world application for testing
  - It covers the why, how, where and what to test
  - There are comparisons of the various forms of testing
  - A demonstration of the Jest & Cyprus tooling setup
  - Writing unit and integration tests for Express
  - Writing unit and integration tests for React
  - Writing E2E tests for the entire application
  - There will be tradoffs no matter what testing is being done
  - The course will not cover all forms of testing
  - It is a very practical course and not too focused on single tech specifics (too much)
