                    Test-Driven Development for React/Redux in an Isomorphic Application
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction 
1 - Introduction
An introduction to the course instructor
The landscape in software developement changes very rapidly
An overview of the course syllabus
  - The course itself will make use of a real example search application
  - There will be demos and code samples
  - There will also be hands on testing and development


                    Section 2 - Isomorphic Applications 
1 - Isomorphic applications overview 
Isomorphic Applications are Javascript applications that run on both server and client side
  - They are sometimes referred to as universal applications
As the above definition is not really all that help there is examples used to illustrate differences from the past
  - Full Page refresh applications
  - Rich Internet applications with AJAX round trips
  - Single Page Isomorphic applications
