                    Mastering React Testing with Jest
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Overview
A very brief introduction to the course at a high level from the instructor
  - The course aims to give you knowledge to use Jest at a high level in real world situations


                    Section 2 - Introduction to Testing React Applications with Jest
1 - About the Author
A brief introduction to the author

2 - Before Beginning
You will need some things before beginning the course
  - You will need some knowledge of how to build apps with React
  - You will need to understand Stores, Dispatchers, Components and Helpers
  - You should ideally be comfortable working in a NodeJS environment using Express and Gulp

3 - What Is Jest? (Part 1)
Uses a Shakespeare quote from King Lear about Jest revealing truth
  - Using Jest to test and mock applications will reveal truths about the application being developed
Jest 
  - https://facebook.github.io/jest/
  - Is a Jasmine based testing framework
    - Jasmine is the most popular(according to the instructor) testing framework
  - It is designed to test React applications and more

4 - What Is Jest? (Part 2)

5 - Technologies Covered in this Course / What You'll Need

6 - Understanding Automatic Mocking

7 - What Is Mocking?

8 - Advantages of Mocking



                    Section 3 - An In-depth Look at the Jest API
1 - Understanding the Jest API
A basic overview of the Jest API
  - Most Jest API methods relate to automatic mocking
    - It has added this ability to the Jasmine framework
  - The course will talk mostly about mocking
  - dontMock is the most common method and important method
  - Because it is based on Jasmine most tests still the Jasmine interface
  - Generally Jest API allows users to create, modify and analyze mocks
