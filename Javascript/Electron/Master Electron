1 - Introduction 
Introduction to the instructor & the course
Electron allows web developers to develop apps for Windows, Mac, Linux
  - This allows for large code reuse as one set of code can be compiled for use on each platform
  - It also means that frameworks that are known to the developer can be utilised for writing these apps

2 - Lesson Structure 
An indepth discussion on the course curriculum & setup
Each lesson will start from the same sample project
Electon and the get started setup can be found at
  - https://electron.atom.io
To get started with the course you will need to clone the get started app
