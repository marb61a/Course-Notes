                    Distributing Electron Applications 
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - HOW ELECTRON APPLICATIONS ARE PACKAGED
1 - The Course Overview
A very quick introduction to the instructor
A quick run through of what the course will covered
Students will need to understand the Electron framework
Distributing applications maybe more time consuming than development
The course will cover the 3 main platforms 
  - Windows, Linux & MAC OS
  - Some require both registering as developers and purchasing code signing certificates
  - You should also have access to the platforms that you plan on deploying to 

2 - Basics Of Packaging
A run through of what the rest of the section covers
Each OS has a different package architecture
  - Each though contains a resources directory
ASAR Archives
  - https://github.com/electron/asar
  - This is similar to the tar archive but with indexing support
  - Asar archives are not compressed
  - There are workarounds for Windows maximum file path limitation
  - Electron patches various Node.js functions to work with Asar archives
  - Distributing final code inside an Asar archive is a recommended approach
  - There is a cli available for adding or extracting from Asar archives
    - npm install -g asar
  - To add a file to an Asar archive
    - asar pack oldfile newfile.asar
