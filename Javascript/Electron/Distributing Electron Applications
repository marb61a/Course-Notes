                    Distributing Electron Applications 
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - HOW ELECTRON APPLICATIONS ARE PACKAGED
1 - The Course Overview
A very quick introduction to the instructor
A quick run through of what the course will covered
Students will need to understand the Electron framework
Distributing applications maybe more time consuming than development
The course will cover the 3 main platforms 
  - Windows, Linux & MAC OS
  - Some require both registering as developers and purchasing code signing certificates
  - You should also have access to the platforms that you plan on deploying to 

2 - Basics Of Packaging
A run through of what the rest of the section covers
Each OS has a different package architecture
  - Each though contains a resources directory
ASAR Archives
  - https://github.com/electron/asar
  - This is similar to the tar archive but with indexing support
  - Asar archives are not compressed
  - There are workarounds for Windows maximum file path limitation
  - Electron patches various Node.js functions to work with Asar archives
  - Distributing final code inside an Asar archive is a recommended approach
  - There is a cli available for adding or extracting from Asar archives
    - npm install -g asar
  - To add a file to an Asar archive
    - asar pack oldfile newfile.asar

3 - Where To Publish?
There are different OS stores that applications can be publish to using them has advantages and disadvantages
  - Stores include Windows Store, App Store (Mac), Ubuntu App Store
Advantages
  - A wider audience to reach
  - Users are quicker to trust
Disadvantages
  - Store owners take a percentage of sales
  - Releases are slower due to review phases
  - Some stores may place limits on app functionality
The course instructor recommends allowing downloads both from within but also outside app stores
There are some alternatives available to App stores
  - GitHub releases
    - This is a free platform
    - It is well integrated with the GitHub platform
    - Packages are available from the Releases pane of the GiHub repo
    - The analytics provided however are not very good
  - Bintray
    - This is free for open source projects
    - There is support for deb/rpm repositories
    - It can be expensive for non open source projects
Once you understand and decide where to deploy the next question is how to deploy
  - Manual Deployment
    - Go to each supported OS and build and upload the app
  - Automated Deployment
    - This uses Continuous Integration (CI) services such as Travis for *nix & Appveyor CI for Windows
    - This allows for build and deploy with a single command

4 - Managing Electron Native Modules
Native Modules
  - They are NodeJS C++ Add-ons which expose native functionality to JavaScript
  - There needs to be a C++ build environment
  - The resulting binary must be compatible with the v8 ABI of the desired Electron version
    - ABI is an acronym standing for Application Binary Interface
    - Node makes use of the v8 JS virtual machine
  - If npm is not configured properly then it will build against the v8 ABI of the node installed on the local system
    - This may cause compatability issues
Each platform will have different C++ build environments
  - On Windows & Linux the Python version installed must be 2.3 and not 3.x
  - Also environment variables will need to be set for use with npm
Example Syntax
  // Setting environment variables on *nix systems
  export VARIABLE=value
  // Setting environment variables on Windows Systems
  set VARIABLE=value
There are different environmental variables which must be set
  - GYP_MSVS_VERSION=<VS version>                         
    - This is a Windows only variable which tells what VS version is used
    - Gyp is a build tool -- https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp
  - npm_config_disturl=https://atom.io/download/electron  
    - This points to the headers it should use to build native addons
    - It is recommended to pass the URL displayed here
  - npm_config_runtime=electron
