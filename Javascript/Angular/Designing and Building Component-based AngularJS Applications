                    Designing and Building Component-based AngularJS Applications
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Overview
Very quick, very high level overview of the course by the author


                    Section 2 - Course Introduction
1 - Overview
An overview of the reasons behind the course and a more indepth look at what will be covered
  - Not everyone can afford to move their applications to Angular
    - There can be a large learning curve
  - The Ecosystem can be difficult to setup
  - Angular forces you to use a component based mentality
  - The course will help you learn Angular
  - The course is platform agnostic other than the last chapter
    - That chapter uses Visual Studio and ASP.net

2 - The Lingo
AngularJS and Angular are different
  - Google had not helped ease the confusion
  - AngularJS refers to anything in the 1.x version family
    - It is the most popular version
    - It is the most straight forward to install
  - Angular refers to the version family 2.x and above
    - It is recommended to use Typescript rather than Javascript
    - The setup is a little more involved

A brief summary of the section


                    Section 3 - Shifting to a Component-based Design - Angular (2+) Thinking
1 - Overview
An overview of what is to come in the chapter

2 - What Are Components?
The dictionary definition of a component is that it is a part or element of a larger whole
  - This when translated into Software development is not that far off
In AngularJS components are completely contained widgets
  - They contain all the knowledge of how they look and act with the outside world
    - Covering appearance, behaviour and interface
  - They manifest themselves to the consumer as markup tags with or without some attributes
  - Example <main-navigator></main-navigator> <course course-id="123456" show-details="true"></course>
Component usage is forced on you in Angular2 and was added to AngularJs 1.5

3 - Difference from Directives
In some cases Directives can do more than componenents
  - The trade off though is htat they are more complicated to write
  - They can do more because they can be elements or attributes
  - Example <my-directive ng-model="boundValue" /> 
    <input type="text" ng-model="boundValue" ng-blur="doSomething()" />
  - Although there might be a temptation to use directives rather than components they each have use cases
    - Directives are more useful whe you need to perform DOM manipulation
    - Components help break an application down into smaller parts

4 - Disecting a Component
Components are simpler to write than directives
The 3 primary parts of a component are 
  - Template -- This is the markup that the component will render
  - Controller -- It contains functions etc that template elements will bind
  - Bindings -- These are thepredefined attributes that the component will expose so consumers can send & receive information
  - Some components may ony have a template or a template & controller  
The author has a preference for inlining all 3 of the above

5 - Component-based Design
Components are more suited for a hierarchial structure in application design
  - The author refers to this as component-based design throughout the course
Angular 2+ forces you to use a component based design pattern
  - You have to go out of your way not to use a component design pattern

6 - Other Hierarchical Application Platforms
Hierarchical based systems should be familiar to a lot of developers
  - The example uses xaml visual tree as the hierarchy of the page
  - HTML is also based on organisational design

7 - Comparing Component-based to Traditional Design 1
Templates And Controllers have always been at the heart of Angular.js apps
  - A template or view is usually larger as it represents an entire page
  - Controllers bind to the view
Angular Routing assigns a url to each template & controller combination
