1 - Manage Application State With Immutable JS
Immutable.js is a library from Facebook which provides a series of immutable data structures
  - This includes list, stack, map & set
Because they are immutable and don't chang you are able to build reliable and predictable state models on them
Example Syntax
  mocha.setup('bdd');
  const expect = chai.expect;
  
  function mutateValue(iterable, pos, value){
    iterable[pos] = value;
  }
  
  function updateState(immutable, pos, value){
    return immutable.set(pos, value);
  }
  
  describe('Manage Application State with Immutable.js', () => {
    it('should see side effect when mutating original array', () => {
      const state = ["todo1", "todo2"];
      const mutatedState = state;
    })
    
    it('should avoid side affects when mutating original array', () => {
      const immutableState = Immutable.List(["todo1", "todo2"]);
      const immutableState2 = immutableState;
    })
  })
