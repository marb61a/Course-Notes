                    Javascript Build Automation With Gulp.js
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Course Introduction
1 - Welcome
A brief welcome by the instructor to the course

2 - What To Expect
During the course you will learn to 
  - Use test automation
  - Find issues\bugs & fix them quicker
  - Become more productive
There are things that need to be done other than coding
  - Minification & Concatentation
  - Less to CSS Compilation
  - Optimising 3rd party and custom code
  - Inject files into HTML
  - File revisions and Versioning
  - Testing And Code Analysis
  - All of this can be done and made easier usng Gulp

3 - A Glimpse Of What You Will Learn To Do

4 - Environment And Pre-Requisites

5 - Future
There is a good path to future versions of Gulp
  - It is important to remember that core concepts remain the same



                    Section 2 - The Value Of Gulp As A Javascript Task Runner
1 - The Value Of A Task Runner
Before using a task runner it is important that you understand your motivations for doing so
  - Gulp is another tool for use in a development toolbox
  - Gulp helps us eliminate and automate processes that we will repeat
    - Preparing Javascript\HTML\CSS for production has lots of little tasks that need doing
      - 2 of the most common are minifying and concatenating code
  - There are lots of tools that do parts of what 

2 - Using Gulp As A Task Runner
Demo of a simple pre-created gulpfile

3 - What's In It For You
Gulp allows us to automate tasks simply, this covers 3 main categories
  - Code Quality - Ensure that you have code quality in place
  - Tests - All tests run and pass
  - Code Pipeline - Ensure that tasks needing to be done are done so code is ready for the environment
Gulp ensures that we have quality improvement, faster delivery and repeatble and consistent pipelines
Coding does not end at development, there are other large tasks that need doing, code analysis, testing 
and deployment being among them.

                    Section 4 - Getting Started With Gulp
1 - Getting the starter code
Instructions on getting the sample code from github
  - https://github.com/johnpapa/pluralsight-gulp.git
As usual there are a couple of ways of doing this but cloning the repo is the recommended method
  - git clone https://github.com/johnpapa/pluralsight-gulp.git

2 - Getting Node.js
Node need to be installed - The section is optional
There are instructions for OSX & Windows
Recommended reading to eliminate using sudo with commands
  - https://johnpapa.net/how-to-use-npm-global-without-sudo-on-osx/

3 - Installing Chocolatey & Homebrew
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows
  - https://chocolatey.org
Homebrew is a package manager for OSX
  - https://brew.sh
Linux has several different package managers 
  - Apt for Debian\Ubuntu systems

                    Section 5 - Code Analysis With JSHint And JSCS
1 - Code Analysis With JSHint And JSCS
JSHint is a tool for improving and maintaining code quality
  - http://jshint.com
  - You can configure rules which help prevent errors
  - .jshintrc                                               // A JSON rule file for JSHint
JSCS is a stylechecker for JS code
  - http://jscs.info                                        // It has now merged with the eslint tool
  - .jscsrc                                                 // A JSON rule file for JSCS
