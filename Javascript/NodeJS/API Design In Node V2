What is NodeJS
  - Its a platform built on the Chrome V8 engine
  - It can be used out of the browser to build tooling and network based applications
  - Its maintained by the Nodejs foundation
  - It is more than just Javascript out of the browser

HTTP In Node
  - Node comes with a built in module for creating network based apps
  - It is just a library not a framework
  - You still need to develop abstractions around the http module to build servers

Node Server Frameworks
  - Node has multiple server frameworks
  - Express, Connect, Koa, Hapi & Sails are just a few
  - Express is the defacto framework used by a lot of the community
