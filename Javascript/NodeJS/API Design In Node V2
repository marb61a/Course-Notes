Introduction to the course
This is the second version of the course
  - There are some changes to the approach used from the first version
  - This is not an advanced version of the course compared to the first version
A brief biography and introduction to the course instructor
What is NodeJS
  - Its a platform built on the Chrome V8 engine
  - It can be used out of the browser to build tooling and network based applications
  - Its maintained by the Nodejs foundation
  - It is more than just Javascript out of the browser

HTTP In Node
  - Node comes with a built in module for creating network based apps
  - It is just a library not a framework
  - You still need to develop abstractions around the http module to build servers

Node Server Frameworks
  - Node has multiple server frameworks
  - Express, Connect, Koa, Hapi & Sails are just a few
  - Express is the defacto framework used by a lot of the community

Why Express?
  - The go-to for creating API's with Node
  - Other frameworks are based off Express
  - Lots of plugins, integrations and resources
  - Easy to use, develop or test

Some of the features of Express
  - Declarative Routing
    - Exact routing, pattern matching, parameter matching
  - Middleware
    - Functions that run serially on requests
  - Powerful response options
    - JSON to static files, Stream, Redirect
  - DB agnostic
  - Highly configuarable and much more

Example Syntax
  // Simplest Example 
  const express = require('express');
  
  // Declare an app from express
  const app = express
  
  // Setup basic routing for the index route
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ok: true});
  })
  
  // Start the server on a given port
  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('http://localhost:3000');
  })

Example Syntax
  // From the course GitHub repo, src/index.js
  // The course will use webpack for build the example app
  // Also Hot Module Reloading will be used on the server side
  import http from 'http';
  import { createServer } from 'http';
  
  import app from './server';
  let currentApp = app;
  
  if(module.hot){
    module.hot.accept(['./server'], () => {
      server.removeListener('request', currentApp);
      server.on('request', app);
      currentApp = app;
    })
  }
