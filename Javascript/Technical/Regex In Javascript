1 - Introduction
A regular expression can be defined as a sequence of characters that defines a pattern that can be used to
match that pattern inside of another string
Example Syntax
  "use strict";
  
  var str = 'Is this This';
  
  // Javascript has 2 different ways to create a regular expression
  // The first one the instructor calls the constructor method
  // It is very important to understand that what is passed in to RegExp() is a pattern not a string
  var regex = new RegExp("is");
  
  // Rgeular expressions provide some methods to use to find a pattern
  // The test() function will always return true or false 
  console.log(regex.test(str));
  
  // The second method for creating a regular expression the instructor calls the literal regular expression
  // It is delimited by 2 forward slashes and the pattern is passed between them
  var str = 'Is this This';
  
  var regex = /is/;
  console.log(regex.test(str));
  
  // To get more information on the match the exec() function can be used
  console.log(regex.exec(str));
