2 - What is React Native? 
There is a very important sentence used by the React Native development team to sum up the framework
  - Learn once write everywhere
  - This differs slightly from other similar frameworks like Ionic
  - You can build mobile apps using Javascript and React Native
A React Native is not
  - A web app running on a mobile device
  - A web app hosted in a WebView in a native app eg Ionic
It is though a Javascript and React Native App compiled to native code
It uses both React and React Native code
  - It replaces the DOM as items like divs and spans can not be compiled

3 - A Closer Look 
Exploring the concept of the alternative DOM
React for the web
  - <div>
  - <input>
Native Component Android
  - android.view
  - EditText
Native Component iOS
  - UIView
