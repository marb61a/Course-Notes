                    React Native - The Practical Guide
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Getting Started
1 - Welcome! 
A quick welcome to the course video.
A quick intro to the instructor and a high level overview of the course

2 - What is React Native? 
There is a very important sentence used by the React Native development team to sum up the framework
  - Learn once write everywhere
  - This differs slightly from other similar frameworks like Ionic
  - You can build mobile apps using Javascript and React Native
A React Native is not
  - A web app running on a mobile device
  - A web app hosted in a WebView in a native app eg Ionic
It is though a Javascript and React Native App compiled to native code
It uses both React and React Native code
  - It replaces the DOM as items like divs and spans can not be compiled

3 - A Closer Look 
Exploring the concept of the alternative DOM
React for the web
  - <div>
  - <input>
Native Component Android
  - android.view
  - EditText
Native Component iOS
  - UIView
  - UITextField
React Native
  - <View>
  - <Text>

4 - What Happens to JavaScript? 
The JavaScript logic will not be compiled to Java, Swift etc
  - React Native will create a JavaScript environment where the code can run
  - It is similar to the approach NodeJS takes  

5 - Creating Our First React Native App 

6 - Dealing with Limitations of React Native 
React Native apps can be hard work
  - Javascript is learned once and written everywhere
  - There is little or no cross platform styling unlike Ionic
  - There are only a small number of pre-built components
  - There are tools to create responsiveness but no responsiveness out of the box
  - This all means that either custom code or extensive use of Third-Party packages
  - React Native can be very unstable as it is constantly under development

7 - What a Good Course Offers 
In the opinion of the course instructor a good React Native course
  - Introduces a student to the core concepts
  - Then teaches them the basics
  - Dives into common Third-Party libraries
  - Explains how to use common tools
  - Shows practical examples
  - It also focuses on showing how the student can move on after the course with their own apps 

8 - Course Requirements 
Students should already know
  - Javascript and React
  - Redux
  - No native development language are known
  - There are some restrictions if developing on a Mac system

9 - Course Outline 
A brief generalised run through of the sections of the course 

10 - How to get the Most out of This Course 
To get the most out of the course it is the same as taking any other course
  - Just watching will not teach as much so coding along is the best way to learn
  - If facing issue debug using the course code to compare you own against

                    Section 2 – Diving into the Basics
1 - Module Introduction 
A quick introduction to the module and what it will cover

2 - Creating a New Project 
How to create a boilerplate app using the create react native cli tool
The IDE that the project will use is Visual Studio Code

3 - JSX Elements you Can and Can't Use 
The syntax is very similar to React web projects
  -  imports are the same way
There are separate imports for using React Native
If building for a mobile device the device must recognise the elements
  - There are no standard set of components available due to platform differences
  - This is why in React Native web elements such as div's, H1 etc cannot be used
  - The React Native docs will show which components can be used

4 - Ejecting from Create React Native App 
To eject from a create-react-native-app
  - npm run eject
  - This is a command provided by the setup

5 - How to Use the Attached Code 
The attached code is only part of a project
  - This is because of the size of the project for the different platforms

6 - Running the App on an Android Simulator (+ Setup) 
Downloading and installing the Android Studio IDE
  - Both the JDK and JRE need to be installed
  - The path to the ADB will be needed
    - The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) should be part of the installation already

7 - Running our App on a Real Android Device
You will need to enable USB debugging on the device
  - The simulator will be mostly used in the course

8 - Preparing XCode (for iOS) 

9 - Running our App on an iOS Simulator 

10 - Running our App on an iOS Device 

11 - A Good Development Setup 
When running the Android simulator you can open a debug or developer menu
  - This is done by holding the ctrl and m keys
  - Live reloading is useful and saves times when making changes
  - Hot Reloading is enabled in the example
To open the same menu on a physical device, you can simply shake the device
