Example Syntax
  // Getting started class
  export default class GettingStarted extends Component{
    render(){
      return(
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={styles.welcome}>
            Welcome to React Native
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.instructions}>
            To get started edit index.ios.js
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.instructions}>
            Press CMD + R to reload
            CMD + D or shake for dev menu
          </Text>
        </View>
      )
    }
  }
  
  // In React Native the convention for styles is to have them at the bottom of the file
  // This will use a StyleSheet.create invocation
  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      justifyContent: 'center',
      alignItems: 'center',
      backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
    },
    welcome: {
      fontSize: 20,
      textAlign: 'center',
      margin: 10,
    },
    instructions: {
      textAlign: 'center',
      color: '#333333',
    }
  })
