                    Modern Asynchronous Javascript
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Callbacks
1 -Callback Nesting Nightmare
Introduction to the instructor and a brief welcome
  - The instructors aim is to help get past issues using Node & Javascript
Example Syntax
  // This is a snag that the course instructor ran into in a project
  // The project is an Express & Node app that uses MySQL to store data
    // This is an endpoint which can receive a form submission
    // The code is overly verbose for what it does
    app.post('/users', function(req, res) {
      connection.query('INSERT INTO users SET ?', req.body,
        // Callback function
        function(err, result){
          if(err) throw err;
          res.send('User has been added to the database with an ID of : ' + result.insertId);
        }
      )
    })
