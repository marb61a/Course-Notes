                    Redux Once And For All
                    Course Notes

Part 1
The course leans heavily to hands on coding rather than theory
  - There will be brief theoretical explanations of subjects and then hands on
  - There will also be do it yourself exercises and the solutions explained subsequently
  - The instructor recommends using either pair or group coding

Redux
  - This is a state management library
  - It helps ease the complexity of managing state in the application
  - React managing state can be troublesome
    - This can be because of the chain of components which may need props passing multiple levels
  - At its core Redux is only a store
    - A store is similar to a model in the MVC architecture style
    - There is however only 1 store in redux which holds the application state
    - This is a Javascript object
  - Unidirectional data flow is where data flows from parent to child components
    - If any change is made to the state it flows down to the child components
  - Redux expands on this by having a single store which is accessible by all container components
  - Dont be confused by the academic terms used around Redux
  - Stores are immutable (read only)
    - The only part of the application that can change the store state is the store itself
    - It does this by providing a dispatch mechanism
      - Any component that has access to the store can send actions to the store
      - Dispatching actions is just a way of sending meassages
      - After receiving these messages the store can decide whether to change its internal state
      - The store also provides subscription mechanisms so that components can be notified of any changes
  - The store provides 3 API
    - A way for container components to get the state
    - A way for the components to subscribe to state changes
    - It can send messages on whether it will update its internal state or not
  - The example of interacting with your bank account is used to explain Redux
  - Reducer functions are where Redux gets its name
    - Reducer functions are difficult for beginners
    - It is just a way of creating a function that updates or summarises a value
    - It is the same as a reduce operator eg array.reduce
    - Reduce is the most powerful operator in the instructors opinion as it can do everything map etc can do 
    - Reducers like a reduce operator always has access to two values 

Example Syntax
  - Create a new react app using create-react-app
    - It must be installed -> npm install -g create-react-app
  - There are dozens of react bolierplate apps available
