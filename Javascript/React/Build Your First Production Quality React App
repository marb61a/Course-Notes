                    Build Your First Production Quality React App
                    Course Notes
The Repo for the course app is available at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/react_todos

                    
1 - Bootstrap A React Application Through The CLI With Create React App
Start by installing the Create React App cli globally
  - npm install -g create-react-app
To create a react project
  - create-react-app .    // This will create an app in the directory you are in which you may not want
This creates a boilerplate app with some npm commands already installed
  - npm start             // Starts the server
  - npm run build         // Bundles the app into static files
  - npm test              // Starts the test runner
  - npm run eject         // Removes this tool, copies dependencies, config files and scripts into app directory. 
                          // This is permanent! so be very careful
The first run message will tell you to edit
  - src/App.js
  - You will also get a not optimised message
Changing the appintro class to say "Hello World"
  - This change is automatically rebuilt
    - This is good for pointing out mistakes as well as improving development time
The entry point for the app is index.js
Use a separate tab to run an initial npm test which will pass if the component is rendering properly
  - These too will reload and run tests added
A single command has set up an entire React Application!!!!

2 - Render A React UI with JSX
The instructor recommends mocking a static version of components you wish to use to make your app with
Remember to use className instead of class as that is a reserved key word is JS
  - Adding new form to accept adding new todos
    - Input type is text
  - Added another div element with unordered list
  - Added some basic css for the input, ul & li elements - App.css
    - You can remove  the bullet points form li elements with a CSS directive
        - list-style-type: none;

3 - Render A React UI Based on Initial State
At this moment the output being rendered is static
  - In order for todos to be rendered dynamically the components must be given state
  - We start by adding a constructor to the app component class
    - Constructors are added using constructor (){}
    - Added at the top of the class
    - Super is use to ensure that the constructor for the class being extended is called
  - Define state for the component
    - this.state = {}
    - The state object will contain whatever data structures our component needs to render properly
    - An array is added each will represent a todo
  - Saving at this stage will not make a visual change as there has be no updating of the render
  - Example uses React Devtools which is an add on for chrome browser and is available from the store
Updating the component to render based on the state rather than the static todos
  - Add this.state.todos to the render method
    - Use curly braces to separate the javascript from the surrounding JSX
  - Use the map() function to return todos
    - Extensive notes on map are available at the following
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Javascript/ES6/ES6 The Complete Developer's Guide
  - The app output will look pretty much the same but this time the output is coming from state
  - There will be warnings about each child in an array or iterator needing a key property
    - This will be fixed by adding a key property to the li and the value to todo.id
  - Adding checked={todo.isComplete} to the li to provide a state for the checkbox
    - This will cause an error as you will need an onChange() handler when using a checked property
    - The quick way of fixing is to change checked to defaultChecked

4 - Synchronize React UI And State With Controlled Components
In React a rendered view should be a function of application state
  - This means that changes in state should be reflected in the view
    - The view and state should be in sync
  - This is also true for changes that come from user input
    - Added currentTodo to the constructor and the state to the input field
    - In order for input to be captured there needs to be an event handler added to the text input field
    - This is then assigned to the currentTodo property
      - A handleInputChange method is added to the app.js to accomplish this
      - The value of the text input will be gotten using evt.target.value
      - New to React people may use this.state.currentTodo to reassign the evt.target.value but this is not correct
      - The setState method of the component is used to pass in a new value (In this case an object)
      - In order for the setState method to update the state there are a couple of things needed
        - Reference it in the constructor and bind it to this 
        - The second task is to set it as the handler for the onChange event
      - If working correctly text entered will be shown as part of state in devtools react section

5 - Create A Stateless Functional Component For An Input Form
Placing the todo form in it's own component
  - Added a new directory and file to the src folder
    -> src -> component -> todo -> TodoForm.js
  - New component will just be a function
  - As it is exported it will need to be imported into the app.js file
    - You will use {TodoForm} as this is the name
  - There will be errors as in react when we need to pass data into a component that is a stateless function component
    it will need to be passed down through props
    - The props will be input into the function
      - It will replace this.state & this 
  - The props will need to be added back to the form which has been added to the app.js page

6 - Refactor React Components To Be Stateless Functional Components
Changing the TodoList in to its own component from being rendered in the main app component
  - A new file will need to be added to the components todo directory -- TodoList.js
  - Again this will be a stateless functional component
  - A new file index.js is created which will hold all imports and export them again
    - This will clean up imports as it will come from a single source
  - Add an instance of the TodoList to ensure that it shows
  - Remove the TodoList from the app.js markup and move it to the TodoList file
    - This will again cause an undefined error
    - Again this.state changes to props
    - A todos attribute will need to be added to app.js to allow the TodoList to be seen
Creating a separate component for an individual todo list item
  - Add a new TodoItem.js file to the components/todo directory
  - Move the li from TodoList to TodoItem
    - Again the todo will need to changed to props in order to be seen
    - Uses the spread operator to get properties rather than todo.id etc
    - Moving the key property to TodoList from TodoItem as there will be a problem iterating

7 - Validate Component Input With Prop Types In React
*****  React.PropTypes is deprecated since React 15.5.0
        -  npm module prop-types
React has a method for validating input
  - PropTypes
To use propTypes in a component
  - Call the component and its propTypes property (will be an object)
    - keys should match property names
    // Its important to note that when referencing PropTypes off of React to pick the type for
    // our property that there is an uppercase P at the beginning, where as its lower when defining the object
  - currentTodo: React.PropTypes.string,
  - handleInputChange: React.Proptypes.func
  - To insure that the property is passed in use isRequired()
    - This can be used anywhere if a component needs certain properties
  - Adding PropTypes to TodoList
    -todos:  React.PropTypes.array.isRequired 
  - Adding PropTypes to TodoItem
    - It receives an entire object so there are going to be several properties
    - name: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired
    - isComplete: React.PropTypes.bool
    - id: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
