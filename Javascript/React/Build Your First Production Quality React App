                    Build Your First Production Quality React App
                    Course Notes
The Repo for the course app is available at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/react_todos

                    
1 - Bootstrap A React Application Through The CLI With Create React App
Start by installing the Create React App cli globally
  - npm install -g create-react-app
To create a react project
  - create-react-app .    // This will create an app in the directory you are in which you may not want
This creates a boilerplate app with some npm commands already installed
  - npm start             // Starts the server
  - npm run build         // Bundles the app into static files
  - npm test              // Starts the test runner
  - npm run eject         // Removes this tool, copies dependencies, config files and scripts into app directory. 
                          // This is permanent! so be very careful
The first run message will tell you to edit
  - src/App.js
  - You will also get a not optimised message
Changing the appintro class to say "Hello World"
  - This change is automatically rebuilt
    - This is good for pointing out mistakes as well as improving development time
The entry point for the app is index.js
Use a separate tab to run an initial npm test which will pass if the component is rendering properly
  - These too will reload and run tests added
A single command has set up an entire React Application!!!!

2 - Render A React UI with JSX
The instructor recommends mocking a static version of components you wish to use to make your app with
Remember to use className instead of class as that is a reserved key word is JS
  - Adding new form to accept adding new todos
    - Input type is text
  - Added another div element with unordered list
  - Added some basic css for the input, ul & li elements - App.css
    - You can remove  the bullet points form li elements with a CSS directive
        - list-style-type: none;
