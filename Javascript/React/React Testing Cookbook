1 - Setting Up Dependencies
The following are installed
  - Mocha for running tests
    - This is used for the example but there are many other test tools
  - Expect for assertions
  - React-addons-test-utils

2 - Running Tests
To setup so that you can run tests in the project you will have to edit the projects package.json
Example Syntax
  // Package.json file
  // Again double braces are needed
  // Babel is used to transpile React Code\ES6 
    "scripts": {
    // Telling where to look for the files needed
      "test": "mocha './src/**/*.spec.js' --compilers js:babel-core/register"
    }

  // Example spec file
  import expect from 'expect';
  
  describe('empty test', () => {
    it('should work', () => {
      expect(true).toEqual(true);
    })
  })
