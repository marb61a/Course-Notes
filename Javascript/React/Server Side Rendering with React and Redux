                    Server Side Rendering with React and Redux
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Getting Started
1 - A Few Notes
A quick welcome to the course
Some administration work prior to getting started on the technical part of the course

2 - Link to Github Repo
A link is provided to the course repo which contains
  - All the source code from the course
  - Slides and diagrams that are used in the course

3 - Why Server Side Rendering?
A quick discussion of what Server Side Rendering solves
Tradional React Apps are rendered on the client-side in the browser
There is a vanilla React app generated in order to demonstrate client-side rendering in React
The procedure for a client side rendered app is
  - Brower requests a page
  - Then the browser requests a js file
  - Finally there is some content visible on the page
  - Each step will  have a time period between them
  - These time periods can be hugely problematic
  - Longer periods have been proven to cost websites traffic and businesses money 

4 - SSR Overview
The previous example had a fairly sparse html file
  - Now the html has a fair amount of code in the file
  - The example also uses a free code formatterto make the html more legible
    - https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html
  - Traditional react apps fetch a file with basically a script tag inside
  - SSR will however have a lot of content inside the html format
  - Sending a fully rendered html page can have effects
    - One major effect is the simplification of the process of rendering a page
    - Page load times are also much quicker
  - SSR is fundamentally about getting content on page quicker
  - The instructor uses a diagram to demonstrate SSR flow
    - In the browser
      - The user navigates.app.com
    - On the server
      - The request is received
      - The React app is loaded in memory
      - Any required data is fetched
      - Render the React app
      - Send the generated HTML to the user
