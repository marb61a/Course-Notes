                    Course Notes


1 - 
Introduction to the instructor
In order to understand state the course will take a tour of different approaches to managing state
In order to understand more the course will start right from the ground up
State management can become very complex very quickly
  - The React timer component that is usually the start of React training will be where understanding state will begin
There is also a quick overview of the syllabus
Redux will be taught seperately which the instructor recommends as the best approach
  - Redux is not tied to React in any way
  - React takes some of its ideas from the elm language
  - Redux-Saga will also be looked at
Mobx which is a different approach than Redux for state management
  - Mobx has an approach which is similar to object oriented
State management is not a solved problem
Not too much focus on a given library will be give because
  - Libraries will come and go and may not be useful in 6 or 12 months time
The goal of the course is how to think conceptually about the patterns
