                    Getting Started With Redux
                    Course Notes
                    

1 - Redux: The Single Immutable State Tree
The main principle of Redux is that no matter the complexity of your applications you will
represent the state of your application in a single Javascript Object
The example uses a counter which may be added to or subtracted from
  - There is also an option for adding additional counters
Example Syntax
  // This represents the state object and each item added to the todos is added as an object in the empty array
  [object Object] {
    todos: [],
    visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL'
  }
In Redux the state is also referred to as the state tree

2 - Describing State Changes with Actions

3 - Pure And Impure Functions

4 - The Reducer Function

5 - Writing a Counter Reducer with Tests

6 - Store Methods: getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()

7 - Implementing Store from Scratch

8 - React Counter Example

9 - Avoiding Array Mutations with concat(), slice(), and ...spread

10 - Avoiding Object Mutations with Object.assign() and ...spread

11 - Writing a Todo List Reducer (Adding a Todo)

12 - Writing a Todo List Reducer (Toggling a Todo)

13 - Reducer Composition with Arrays

14 - Reducer Composition with Objects

15 - Reducer Composition with combineReducers()

16 - Implementing combineReducers() from Scratch

17 - React Todo List Example (Adding a Todo)

18 - React Todo List Example (Toggling a Todo)

19 - React Todo List Example (Filtering Todos)

20 - Extracting Presentational Components (Todo, TodoList)

21 - Extracting Presentational Components (AddTodo, Footer, FilterLink)

22 - Extracting Container Components (FilterLink)

23 - Extracting Container Components (VisibleTodoList, AddTodo)

24 - Passing the Store Down Explicitly via Props

25 - Passing the Store Down Implicitly via Context

26 - Passing the Store Down with <Provider> from React Redux

27 - Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (VisibleTodoList)

28 - Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (AddTodo)

29 - Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (FooterLink)

30 - Extracting Action Creators
