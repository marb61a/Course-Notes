                              Notes from the Udemy course  Advanced React with Redux
                              This is by Stephen Grider

                    Section 2: Testing
1 - Project Setup
Setting up the boilerplate for the initial project that will form the basis for projects through the course
The instructor gives a quick run through of the folder structure of the boilerplate project 
Instructions on how to clone the project from Github are also given 

2 - Core Testing - Describe, It, Expect
Start up local server using the following command
  - npm run start
Go to localhost:8080
Learning testing is easier to dive in
Do not write code where you do not already understand what is going on
Whenever you are going to write some test code you should always ask what the behaviour is in the component
The test below will be for the app.js component solely
Test Syntax -> In the app_test.js file -> components -> test folders as part of the boilerplate project
  // Importing some test helpers from the prebuilt test_helper.js file
  // This will be rebuilt from scratch later on in the course
  // Test will only be to ensure that a div says what we want it to say
  import {renderComponent, expect} from '../test_helper';
  
  // Importing the component that you wish to test
  import App from '../../src/components/app';
  
  // Most testing framework use the same 3 keywords as below
  // The course will use Mocha but the concept that will be learned in the course will carry over
  // Use describe to group together similar tests
  describe('App')
  
  // Use 'it' to test a single attribute of a target
  it('shows the correct text')
  
  // Expect is used to make an assertion about a target
  expect
