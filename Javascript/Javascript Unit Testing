                    Notes from Javascript Unit Testing Course

                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Types Of Software Testing 
*** Differing disagreed name on tests of all types
Unit Tests -
  Test small pieces of code
  Tests run in isolation(No dependencies)
  Fast to write and maintain
  Fast to run
  Run often during development
  Written by the developer

Component Tests -
  Test entire component in isolation
  Gives a developers view of the world
  Tests are more complex and thus are harder to write
  Run slower
  Executed less often

Integration Tests
  Tests interaction between units
  Minimise or use dependencies
  Internal units or internal and external units
  Tests are even more complex and thus are harder to write and run
  Run slower
  Executed even less often

Performance Tests
  How long does something take to execute
  How much data can the system handle
  How long does the system take to respond
  Can be at any level of system
  The difficulty to run, write and maintain depends on the application
  Runtime will be dependent on many factors
  Execution time will also be dependent on many factors

Feature Tests
  Test application features
  Minimise or use dependencies
  Presents a user's view of the world
  Run Slower
  Executed with integration tests
  Difficulty to read and write the same level as integration tests.

Acceptance Tests
  A suite of integration or feature tests
  Use dependencies
  Users view of the world(Known as - User Stories)
  Can be difficult to run, write and maintain
  Run Slower
  Executed prior to release
  
 
2 - The Testing Pyramid 
Different applications will need differing testing strategies, the course makes use of conceptual models such as the 
Ice Cream Cone, Software Testing Pyramid and others, these are available at the following address
https://watirmelon.blog/2012/01/31/introducing-the-software-testing-ice-cream-cone/
A general guide to using tests in an application is
- 40% Unit Tests
- 20% Component Tests
- 20% Feature Tests
- 10% Integration Tests
- 5% E2E Tests
- 5% Manual Tests

 
3 - What You Will Learn In This Course

learn from taking the course

Instructions on how to accesss the working files used by the author
 
 
 
                    Section 2 - Unit Testing Basics
1 - Unit Testing Terminology 
  Assertions - Functions that verify values are what you think that they are
    They form the basis for almost all testing
    You can both write your own or use a library
    Node JS standards - Throws, Type Checking, Existence 
  Synchronous - Runs all the way through without stopping
  Asynchronous - The opposite of the above
    JavaScript has single thread of execution
    To execute code at a different time, schedule using callbacks
      NodeJS uses async IO
      Browsers use events
      setTimeout\setInterval
    Avoid waste due to unnecessary polling
  Frameworks - Third Party tools that handle unit testing boilerplate
    Provides a structured way to write tests
    Gives the ability to run tests and also see the results
    Provides a set of basic assertions for use in your tests
    They provide hooks for async tests
    Provide hooks also for mocks, stubs and spies
    There are often communities which offer support
  Stubs - A stub is a function
    They return known dummy data
    They are also deterministic
  Spies - Spies build on top of the stub concept
    They offer stubs with metadata
    You are able to know how many times a function was called and the parameters
  Mock Objects - This simulates the behaviour of real & complx objects
    You will have full control of mock objects
    Used with a lot of testing frameworks
    Heavily used with unit testing
    Again deterministic
 
2 - What A JavaScript Unit Test Looks Like 
    Plunker is used for code demo
    Several pieces in a test
    Need html file to load in necessary resources
    No native assert function in client-side js testing so create your own
