                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - My First Design Patterns
1 - The Course Overview 
Quick overview of the material to be covered by the course
Introduction to the author
The aim of the course is to
  - Understand the various design patterns
  - Understand when best to apply each of the patterns
The course makes some assumptions
  - You have readonable levels of JS knowledge
  - You also have an understanding of object oriented programming
The first section will provide a foundation for the rest of the sections

2 - The Problem with the Global Scope 
In this section there is going to be a demo chat application
  - Initially it will use global scope too freely
Source code for the course accompanies it
  - The first files looked at are index.html and script.js
  Script.js Syntax 
    var leadself = 'Me:',
        leadcomputer = "PC:",
        aSaid = ["This is a cyber chat"],
        msgYes = "yes, that's a great idea.",
        msgNo = "No, that must be a mistake",
        aSasiStuff = [
          "Like mould on books, grow myths on history",
          "She moved like a poem and smiled like a sphynx",
          "As long as we don't die this is going to be one hell of a story",
          "She laughed, and the desert sang",
          "You've got about as much charm as a dead slug"
        ];
