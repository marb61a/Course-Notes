										Section 2 - Syntax
1 - Automatic Semicolon Insertion 
ASI - Automatic Semicolon Insertion
ASI is fairly self-explanatory as it inserts semi-colons in to source code
It inserts these semi-colons when it encounters certain grammatical errors
There is a certain grammar involved in creating variables for example
	- var x = 10; or let x = 10;
Javascript has 3 rules to determine if it will insert a semi-colon
	- If as the code is being read from left to right it encounters a line terminator eg carriage return/ closing brace which
	can both be thought of as terminator tokens. When it encounters one of these it looks at the code after the token and if it 
	does not make grammatical sense it will insert a semi-colon before the terminating token
	- At the end of code, if there are no error such as syntax problems etc and the program does not end with a semi-colon then
	it is going to insert one
	- There are certain types of statements that if they are followed by a carriage return then it does not matter what comes after
	them a semi-colon will be inserted, they are primarily keywords eg continue and also arrow functions where parameter list and 
	the arrow must be on the same line
Best Practice - Author recommends using semi-colons for 3 reasons
	- Style
	- Easier to find bugs from missing semi-colons
	- Less to think about as its easier to use semi-colons

2 - Curly Braces 
JS Borrows a lot from C and C like languages
C like language use opening and closing curly brackets to delimit code
Example Syntax
  function creatObj(x, y){
    if(true){
      // Multiple statements
    } else {
      // Multiple
    }
    
    // This causes a syntax error in newer browsers due to automatic semi-colon insertion
    // This would not cause an error just an invalid return value
    // Using an opening bracket on the same line everywhere in your code will give consistency
    return 
    {
      x: x,
      y: y
    };
  }
Pretty much all control structures use curly braces eg for, if etc
Developers also have a lot of flexibility where they position these bracket
  - Some choose the same line as the function declaration for the opening bracket
  - Others choose a new line to do the same thing
 
3 - Equality 
Like all languages JS has an equality operator
Example Syntax
  var a = 1;
  var b = 2;
  var c = "1";
  
  console.log(a == b);
  
  // Inequality operator
  // Equality and inequality operators work as expected as long as values are of the same type
  console.log(a != b);
  
  // In this case Javascript will coerce its values to the same type
  // In most other programming languages this would be false but in JS it is true
  console.log(a == c);
  
  // 99% of the time you will not want to use the equality or inequality operator
  // Instead you will want to use the identity operator and the opposite non-identical operator
  // The identity operator looks at both the type and the value
  console.log(a === c);
