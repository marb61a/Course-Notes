                    Course Notes from the Udemy Course
                    Complete React Web App Developer
                          By Andrew Mead
  *** This is a combined Project & Theory based course, completed projects urls will be listed in appropriate sections
    
  *** At this moment, I use Cloud9 IDE rather than a local machine install which will change some instructions.
  
                          
                    Section 1: Intro
1 - Why Should I Learn React?
The first lecture is the course author outlining his reasons for learning ReactJS which is commonly referred
to as a framework, over other framworks such as AngularJS. Some dispute the claim that React JS is a framework
and is instead library which can be used in conjunction with other frameworks.

  
                    Section 2: Getting Setup
1 - Installing Atom
Atom is an open source code which is used in the course in place of a more heavyweight IDE such as Visual Studio.
In this video the author shows how to install the Atom Editor.

2 - Installing Git & Bash (Important For Windows Users)
Git is a version control system which is widely used by developers of all kinds. Git is used during the course
to ensure that project code is saved. Git itself is installed on the local machine however to ensure that there 
is no code loss, code is pushed to an online repository such as Github or Bitbucket which are both free.
BASH is a linux shell which has features that the standard windows command prompt lacks but that packages that
will be used during the course need, a windows version of the BASH shell has been made available and is highly 
recommended due to the power it brings users.

3 - Intro To Command Line
A basic intro to some often used commands which you will need during the course.
