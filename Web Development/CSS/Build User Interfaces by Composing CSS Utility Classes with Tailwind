                    Build User Interfaces by Composing CSS Utility Classes with Tailwind
                    Course Notes


1 - Composing CSS Utility Classes with Tailwind Course Introduction
Quick introduction to the course
Tailwind is a CSS framework
  - https://tailwindcss.com 

2 - Compile Tailwind to CSS with gulp
The course starts off with a project containing only an index.html file
To add the Tailwind package to a project using the Yarn package manager
  - yarn add tailwindcss --dev
    - This adds it as a dev-dependency
The example also adds gulp
  - yarn add gulp gulp-postcss --dev

Example Syntax
  // Creating a gulp file
  // gulpfile.js
  const gulp = require("gulp");
  const postcss = require("gulp-postcss");
  const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
  
  const PATHS = {
    css: "./src/styles.css",
    config: "./tailwind.js",
    dist: "./"
  }
  
  gulp.task('css', () => {
    return gulp.src(PATHS.css)
      .pipe(postcss([
        tailwindcss(PATHS.config),
        require('autoprefixer')
      ]))
  });
