                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Building Your Outstanding Training Career
Students should start off the course by videoing themselves speaking about something
  - This can be using a camera phone etc
  - Post the video on Youtube etc and the link on the student board
    - The instructor will give each video an assessment

How to get your trainees to care about you
  - Trainees do not care about the trainer
  - They care about themselves especially in the early part of training
  - Avoid talking about yourself until you have delivered some sort of value

Pinpointing Your Success
  - You will not know if you are successful if you do not know what your goals for the training are
  - These should be very clear in advance
  - In most situations summing up goals should be done in about 30 seconds
  - This is where most people fail

Loving Your Subject
  - Most great trainers love the subject matter of what they teach
  - If the subject matter is not of interest then the trainer has to find some interesting part to engage
  - Effective trainers usually find away to be excited about what they are teaching

Testing Your Communication To Make Sure It Works
  - To check to see if your key points have gotten through is important
  - Ask your audience if they remember this will show if your communication is effective
