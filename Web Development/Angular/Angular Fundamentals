                    Angular Fundamentals
                    Course Notes


1 - Angular Architecture overview
A quick welcome to the course
There is a quick examination from a high level of what the building blocks of an Angular app are
There are 5 main building blocks
  - Modules
    - These contain routes,services, components etc
    - They can also contain other modules
  - Components
    - Components contain a Template, data and logic
    - They also form part of a DOM Tree
    - Writing HTML creates a DOM tree
  - Directives
    - This can be bound to an existing DOM element and its children
    - It can attach behaviour and transform or extend an element
  - Routing 
    - This renders a component based on URL state and drives navigation
  - Services
    - A service is basically a data layer
    - It contains logic that is not component related such as API requests

2 - Classes, Spread operator, Arrow functions, Immutability
Example Syntax
  // The course is entirely in Typescript
  // main.ts, this uses a shopping list for an example which is JS rather than Angular
  function ShoppingList() {
    this.groceries = [];
    
  }
