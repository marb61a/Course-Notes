                    Section 2 – Getting Started: Overview and Installation
1 - Section Introduction
A quick introduction to the material that will be covered in the section

2 - What Is a Database?
There are multiple definitions
  - A collection of data eg rolodex, file cabinet, phonebook
  - It has a method for accessing or manipulating that data
DBMS - Database Management System
  - Having data and having an interface for that data are different things
  - The DBMS talks to the database
  - Having the data without a means to interact with it is not good
Common Databases
  - Oracle, SQLite, MYSQL, PostgreSQL
  - Although people say databases they are usually talking about the DBMS

3 - SQL Vs. MySQL
SQL is an acronym
  - Structured Query Language, it is the language we use to talk to the database
  - Working with MySQL you will use SQL
  - There are slight differences in SQL syntax between different DBMS

4 - Installation Overview - WATCH BEFORE INSTALLING
Installing anything can be difficult
There a 3 installation options
  - PC based computer
  - MAC systems
  - Cloud9 platform 
    - Instructor recommends this approach as this will be used in the course & its easier to get help

5 - Setting Up Cloud9
There is an online development platform called Cloud 9
  - https://c9.io
  - You will have to register for an account
  - There is a free tier but asks for credit card
  - Create a new workspace using the HTML5 workspace
// I am a longtime Cloud9 user

6 - Cloud9: What If I Don't Have a Credit Card?
The instructor has a proceddure for students without a credit card

7 - Exploring The Cloud9 Interface
A quick overview of the Cloud9 overview for those unfamiliar

8 - Cloud9 Interface Challenge
A series of quick exercises to get used to the cloud9 interface
  - Make new folders files etc

9 - Installing MySQL on Cloud9
Cloud9 has a customised methodology for running MySql which is much easier than other methods
  - https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mysql/1718

10 - Your First MySQL Activity
Trying the following commands
  - help;
    - This gives a list of commands which can be used
    - This can be finetuned eg help datatypes; shows datatypes
  - show databases;
    - This shows databases that exist on the system 
    - There are some created by default
  - select @@hostname;
    - Very rarely used
    - It will show your workspace

11 - Mac Installation
Installation Guide for insttalling MySql on Mac OSX systems

12 - Windows Installation
Guide to installing MySql on Windows 
There are plenty of tutorials and guides to installing MySql on Windows
  - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/windows-installation.html



                    Section 3 – Creating Databases and Tables
1 - Section 3 Introduction
A quick introduction to the material that will be covered in the section

2 - Creating Databases
You will create a database inside the running database server
  - mysql-ctl cli                             // Will start up the mysql server
  - show databases;                           // Will list the databases on the system
  - CREATE DATABASE my_database               // This will create a database called my_database
    - using something like my database is not recommended, you dont have to use underscore eg MyDatabase is good too

3 - Dropping Databases
The command to delete a database is fairly simple
  - DROP DATABASE my_database;                // This command will delete the my_database db, again the semicolon is needed

4 - Using Databases
To use a specific database there is a command in MySql
  - USE my_database;                          // This tells MySQL which database you want to work with eg my_database
To find out which database is currently being used
  - SELECT database();
  - If you delete the database you are using the SELECT database() will return null
