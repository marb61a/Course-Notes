1 - Introduction displaying data
Laravel comes with the Blade templating engine
Using templating in an app has several advantages
  - It helps keep the app DRY which avoid repetition
  - Components are reusable
  - It allows for data to be quickly passed through an application
The main way to display data in PHP is to use echo
  -> <?php echo $username ?>
In Laravel the way to display data is different
  -> {{ $username }}
  -> {{ isset($title) ? $title : "My App" }}
  - The curly braces on each side are called Blade tags
Blade has several benefits for app development
