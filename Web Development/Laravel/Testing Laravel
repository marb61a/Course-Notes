                    Testing Laravel
                    Course Notes


1 - Intro to Application Testing 
PHPUnit and testing in general can be confusing at first
  - It may take some practice before it makes some sense
  - It may also be difficult to work it into your everyday workflow
  - This will be what the course focuses on
The course will use Laravel as its base
  - To generate a new Laravel App there are a couple of options that are available
    - laravel new MyApp to generate a Laravel boilerplate app 
    - composer create-project MyApp, this is available on Laravel 5.x systems
When you setup a laravel project you instantly get PHPUnit
  - You will also get an entry in the composer.json file for requirements
  - There is also a phpunit.xml file generated which is essentially a config file for PHPUnit
  - There is also a /tests directory and an ExampleTests.php file to get started
  - There are some helpers available in the file
