                    Laravel Routing
                    Course Notes


1 - Getting started
Routing is the foundation of every app
  - It will be the starting point for each part of the app
Example Syntax
  - To create a new Laravel App
    - laravel new routing-app
    - This will create a boilerplate app and bring in Composer dependencies
    - It will also generate the app key needed and the env file
To  run the app using the built in PHP server
  - php artisan serve
    - Starts on localhost:8000
  - Ensure that you are in the app folder before running
All routes are kept in the app folder, routes.php
  - There is a home page router created by the app generation
Example Syntax
  Route::get('/', function(){
    return view('welcome');
  });

  // Adding the about route
  // Views are looked for by default in the resources/views folder
  // View files normally use blade templates, file names reflect that eg about page -> about.blade.php
  // Linking in the example is done using HTML tags
  Route::get('about', function(){
    return view('about');
  })
