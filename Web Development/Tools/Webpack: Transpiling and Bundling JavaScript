A brief introduction to both the course and the instructor



                    Section 2 - What Is Webpack?
1 - Welcome
Webpack can be considered as both a compiled and a bundler
A quick introduction to the section 

2 - Interactive Coding with Hot Module Replacement
Webpack has many benefits, one of these is Hot Module Reload (HMR)
  - This is a much more interactive way of cding instead of code, compile, wait and reload
This example will be making use of the Vue.js framework
  - Sudents can follow along by using the vue-cli tool and following the instructions on the home page

3 - Seamless Compilation
There is a seamless ability to integrate other build tools
  - This means there is a seamless compilation of anything, code, images, styles etc
  - Tools that can be included are Babel, Typescript, CSS tools etc

4 - Consistent Tooling

5 - Modularity
