                    Blockchain Development on Hyperledger Fabric using Composer
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction to the Course 
Brief introduction to the course and the author
Hyperledger is much more complex than Ethereum or Bitcoin
The course will not cover Architecture as it is for developers
It is recommended that students code as much as possible
  - Experimentation too is very much encouraged

2 - Download PDF Link + Course Information and Updates 
PDF link from the author

3 - What is Hyperledger? 
Hyperledger is an umbrella of Open Source Blockchain and related tools
  - https://www.hyperledger.org
  - It was started in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation
  - It is an incubator for Blockchain Technologies that promote reuse
There are 2 categories
  - DLT Frameworks
    - There are 4 active DLT framework initiatives
      - Hyperledger Sawtooth which is led by Intel
      - Hyperledger Iroha led by Soramitsu
      - Hyperledger Fabric led by IBM is partnership with others
        - Production ready Fabric 1.0 was released on July 21st 2017
        - It is evolving very quickly
        - It is a Blockchain framework for creating business ready blockchain applications
          - It provides a set of infrastructure and application building blocks
          - It provides practices and guidelines for creating Blockchain applications 
      - Hyperledger Burrow led by Monax
  - Tools
    - There are 4 tool initiatives
      - Hyperledger Cello which aims to simplify managment and creation of Blockchain infrastructure
      - Hyperledger Composer is for create business network applications using the high level Composer language
      - Hyperledger Explorer provides visibility into an operational Blockchain system
      - Hyperledger Quilt aims to achieve interoperability between chains
      - The tools should be able to be reused across different frameworks
