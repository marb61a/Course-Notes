                    Course Notes


1 - Intro to Vuex
Managing state in an app with many components can be tricky
Vuex is designed after the Flux pattern from Facebook
  - https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples
  - It is Vue's own state management pattern and library
  - Using it can enhance an application
When talking about state it refers to the data that components depend on and render
  - When components change state they need to communicate this 
  - The default method of passing events up and props down can become extremely complex
