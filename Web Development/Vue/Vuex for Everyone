                    Vuex for Everyone
                    Course Notes


1 - Meet Vuex
Vuex is a state management library for Vue
  - https://vuex.vuejs.org
Vue makes it very simple to work with components
  - Data can be served among them using events and props
  - This is very true of small to medium projects
  - Best practice is to have small components with single responsibilities
  - This structure can overwhelm when an app goes beyond a certain size which is where Vuex comes in
  - Vuex serves as a central data store for all components
  - It also means that state rules are enforced in a predictable manner

2 - Create a new project with vue-cli
The course uses the vueschool webpack template
  - vue init vueschool/webpack-template shopping-cart
    - It is a fork of the official webpack template to ensure everyone is using the same 
    - shopping-cart is the project name
    - Answer no to all questions and use the runtime build
  - cd shopping-cart
    - This changes into the project directory
    - Type yarn at the commend prompt to install dependencies using the yarn package manager
    - yarn dev to start the development server
Using the official Vuex example library for mocking purpose
  - https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/dev/examples/shopping-cart/api/shop.js
