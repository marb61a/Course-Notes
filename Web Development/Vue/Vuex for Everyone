                    Course Notes


1 - Meet Vuex
Vuex is a state management library for Vue
  - https://vuex.vuejs.org
Vue makes it very simple to work with components
  - Data can be served among them using events and props
  - This is very true of small to medium projects
  - Best practice is to have small components with single responsibilities
  - This structure can overwhelm when an app goes beyond a certain size which is where Vuex comes in
  - Vuex serves as a central data store for all components
  - It also means that state rules are enforced in a predictable manner
