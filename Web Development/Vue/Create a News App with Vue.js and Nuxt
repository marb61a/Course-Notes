                    Create a News App with Vue.js and Nuxt 
                    Course Notes


1 - Start a Nuxt Project with npx and the Vue.js CLI
This will use npx, this is a runner that has been added to npm
  - Instead of using the following to run Jest for example ./node_modules/.bin/jest
  - You can now instead run npx jest
To get started with nuxt community starter template
  - npx vue-cli init nuxt-community/starter-template hackernuxt
    - In this case hackernuxt is the name of the project being generated with the template generator
In the nuxt.config.js file the ESLint task is removed
  - This is solely to avoid any formatting tangents

2 - Add a CSS Library from npm to Nuxt
There is then a CSS library added to the project, in this case Tachyons
  - npm install tachyons tachyons-debug
  - https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons && https://tachyons.io
Example Syntax
  // In the nuxt.config.js file add the global CSS files that you wish to include
  css: [
    // This recognises a node_modules path
    "tachyons/css/tachyons.min.css",
    // This is included to help with layout as tachyons-debug adds outlines around everything
    "tachyons-debug/css/tachyons-debug.min.css"
  ]
  
  // index.vue, tachyons is an atomic library so can be added to any elements
  <template>
    // f1 sets the text to the biggest size font and code is the font style
    <div class="f1 code">
      Hello World
      // The tachyons-debug adds outlines to each element
      // list elements have red outlines, div elements have blue
      <ul>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </template>
