                    Course Notes


1 - Postlight Headless Wordpress Starterkit
WordPress + React Starter kit  is available at
  - https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter
  - Course uses Homebrew which is mac only, Yarn is also available
To get started clone the github repo
  - git clone https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter.git
  - This will give a WordPress frontend and backend
    - We may not use the WP frontend sometimes
    - In the course there will be replacement examples for example using Gatsby
  - The frontend folder installed is the Next.js folder install
  - The wordpress folder is the WP install
  - To install the WP backend 
    - cd wordpress
    - yarn install
      - This assumes that yarn is installed
      - If WP is install it will ask if it is to replace the existing install
      - The post install will tell you that you can log into the install but it needs the server to run first
        - The password and login name are displayed
      - To start the server -> yarn start

2 - Postlight Wordpress Backend
A quick tour of the headless WP backend
  - It is the same as other WP installs apart from a couple of menu items
  - Custom Fields will allow for custom post types 
  - Headless allows for posting custom types
  - CPT UI again is for creating custom post types

3 - Exploring The Wordpress API
A quick exploration of the WP Rest API
  - This is a WP API not just the headless package
The course uses a Crome plugin for formatting the JSON from the API
