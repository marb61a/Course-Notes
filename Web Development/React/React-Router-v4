                    Course Notes


1 - Introduction and Philosophy behind React Router
In order to understand the philosophy behind the React-Router V4 the history of its evolution is examined
Static Routing is when you declare your routes statically as part of the app initialisation
  - Basically routes were created before the app started and they were then passed on.
  - This approach was used in Angular, Ember, Express and previous versions of React-Router
  - Static routing is not bad however it is not really the way that React does things
    - This is because when using React you are composing a UI from components
    - Static routing eliminates the need for composition
    - There were cases of duplication of functionality in some cases in the previous React-Router versions
      - EG <Route onEnter={checkAuth} /> is essentially the same as componentDidMount
  - V4 of the router is designed to eliminate the inconsistencies
  - Using React will make a better JS developer, using React-Router V4 will make a better React Developer
  - Dynamic Routing
