                    React Fundamentals
                    Course Notes


1 - Introduction to the React Ecosystem Video 
The 5 biggest benefits of using React are 
  - Composition, by this it refers to composition of components
    - A component is a small piece of an app functionality that has been wrapped up (encapsulated)
    - Some examples include <Router />, <Date />, <Map /> & <Icon />
    - The same thinking that is applied usually to functions can be applied to Components
    - Instagram app is used to demonstrate the boundaries between components
    - Traditionally application state would exist in the DOM
      - In the React Component model state is managed by each component
      - This approach helps manage complexity in an application
    - This means that the best way of building large applications in React is to build many small ones
    Example Syntax
    // Demonstration of component composition
    var ProfilePic = function(){
      return(
        <img src={'https://photo.fb.com' + this.props.username} />
      )
    }
    
    var ProfileLink = function(){
      return (
        <a href={'https://www.fb.com' + this.props.username}>
          {this.props.username}
        </a>
      )
    }
    
    var Avatar = function(){
      return (
        <div>
        <ProfilePic username={this.props.username} />
        <ProfileLink username={this.props.username} />
        </div>
      )
    }
    
    <Avatar username="Joe Bloggs" />
    
    - This is what makes React so powerful, separating complexity into components and composing them together 
  - Unidirectional Dataflow
    - The main difference between complex web apps and static sites is state
      - Sites like Facebook have a lot of state
      - Things like notifications etc are state Facebook has to manage
      - In React the UI is just a function of the state
        - As the state updates so does the UI
  - Declarative
    - React uses a declarative style of programming
      - Many do not know what this means
    - Imperative style of programming tells how to do something.
      - This has been the most common style of programming 
    - Using declarative has some advantages
      - Reducing the side effects that can occur
      - Mutability is minimised
      - Code is much more readable
      - There are also less bugs in the code
    - React for the most part is declaritive
      - This is because to update state the setState is called which is an imperative approach
  - Explicit Mutations
    - This ties in with calling setState() when updating state
    - This will cause a UI re-render
  - Just JavaScript
    - Getting better at React will make you better at Javascript
    - The React API is fairly small mostly relying on JavaScript
The course will cover several parts of the React ecosystem
  - React, React-Router, Webpack, Babel  and Axios
  - There is a quick explanation of why Webpack exists
