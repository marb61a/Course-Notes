                    Build A React App With Redux
                    Course Notes


1 - Bootstrap a React Application with Yarn & Create React App
The course begins by setting up a boilerplate app (bootstrapping) using the react-create-app cli
  - This can be done using the Yarn package manager
  - yarn create react-app redux-course
    - This will both install the create-react-app tool and setup the project
  - This will create several files and folders including a /src directory which will hold code
  - There are several scripts that will be used in the package.json but the eject script will not be covered in the course
  - To start the app simple type yarn start at the terminal
    - This will start on port 3000 by default
