                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Overview
A quick overview of the course for students about to begin 



                    Section 2 - Course Introduction
1 - Introduction
Brief introduction to both the course and the section 

2 - Application Goals
The goals of the course application
  - It must be rendered on the server
  - The whole app is ES2015
  - It must be able to do Hot Module Reloading
  - Latest libraries are used (Webpack 3 eg)
  - The application is a real world scenario
  - Browser history will be implemented, this can be difficult

3 - Finished Application - Sneak Peek
A quick look at the course project
  - This can help provide context for learners
There are a couple of things to remember 
  - Routes will render on the client or server depending on the request type
  - As soon as the server rendered application is loaded React bootstraps to it and the static app becomes an SPA
  - Once data is fetched from the server it is cached on the client
The repository for the application is available at
  - https://github.com/danielstern/isomorphic-react
  - It displays a list of Stack Overflow questions
