                    GraphQL Data Fetching with Relay
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Welcome
A quick welcome to the course and an introduction to the instructor

2 - What You Need To Know
There are some prerequisites for the student
  - Some experience with React is a must
  - Some ES6 experience is also a must
  - Some knowledge of NPM and command line is recommended
  - Yarn is the package manager used and is recommended but using npm is also possible

3 - Exercise Files
A quick overview of the exercise files that accompany the course



                    Section 2 - Introduction And Setup
1 - IDE And Required Tools
Neither GraphQL or Relay need anything special outside of the tools be used already as a developer
  - This means a good IDE or code editor is used
  - Some IDE's have plugins which are useful
    - The instructor uses VSCode but it is not compulsory
      - A keyboard short cut for bringing up the search box for plugins is
        - ctrl-shift-x
      - There is a graphql plugin recommended which can be installed

2 - GraphQL Overview
A quick overview of the GraphQL ecosystem
  - GraphQL is a query language for any type of API
  - It came about because of the difficulty goes more than 5 layers deep in a friend network using existing methods
  - The main benefit is that you can ask for exactly what you want and get those results and nothing else
  - There are many different tools available for GraphQL such as Apollo
    - https://www.apollographql.com

3 - Server Setup With ES6 Support
Setting up the server for the course app
Example Syntax
  - cd project                          // Assumes that using the included exercise files
  - npm init                            // Adds npm to the project and a package.json file will be generated
The instructor switches to using the Yarn package manager here but sticking with npm is equally fine
  - yarn add babel-cli -D               // Adds the babel-cli as a dev-dependency
  - yarn add babel-preset-es2015
  - yarn add babel-preset-stage-0       // These will convert ES6 to previous version Javascript
  - yarn add express                    // Installs the express server

Example Syntax
  // The .babelrc file that is needed in the course
  {
    "presets": ["es2015", "stage-0"],
    "plugins": [
    ]
  }
  
  // Server.js file
  import express from 'express';
