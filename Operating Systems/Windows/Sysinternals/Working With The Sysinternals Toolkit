                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Overview    
Brief Introduction to the course and the author
Microsoft Ecosystem is getting larger and faults are not going away
Sysinternals are the most used troubleshooting tools in the world
The tools are downloaded 4.5 million times per month
Students should be familiar with the Windows Operating System

                    
                    Section 2 - Introductions to the Sysinternals Tools
1 - Demo About Common Characteristics Of the Tools
A quick demonstration of 2 tools from the set
  - Procmon
    - Will ask for elevation as it needs a device driver
    - Procmon is a 32 bit application
    - Procmon runs as procmon.exe and a child procmon64.exe
    - If a system is 64 bit the 64 bit version will be extracted as well
    - Procmon runs from the user temp folder
    - You may need to whitelist this application
  - Process Explorer
    - You should run Process Explorer as an admin
    - Using Process Explorer to show how pocesses including Procmon run
    - Process Explorer runs as procexp.exe and a chile procexp64.exe
Both of the above are standalone executables, which means that there are no installation files required and are easily
cleaned from the system

Example
  - Run command prompt as administrator
  - fltmc         // This is the filter manager
  - It should show Procmon23 as that is the filter driver required to catch all traffic going to the registry or filesystem



                    Section 3 - Installing And Using The Sysinternals Tools
1 - Acquiring And Installing The Toolkit  
How to install the tools so that you get the biggest benefit
There are no limits to the amount of copies that you can download
You should always download from the official website
You are not allowed to distribute the tools
There is no access to the source code anymore
The only support available is in the sysinternals forum
  - https://forum.sysinternals.com
There are 2 options for downloading the tools
  - The Sysinternals suite which comes as a zip file
  - Via the site which is useful is your computer has issues as you get one tool at a time
    - https://live.sysinternals.com
    - This is also available as a WebDAV path which means that you can map a drive to it if you have the WebClient servie running
      - There is a tutorial available on setting up the WebDav path
        - http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/itservices/ithelp/my-computer/files-and-security/work-off-campus/webdav/webdav-on-windows-10
The Zip file that contains the tools also contains an Alternate Data Stream (ADS)
  - This means that it will be tagged as being potentially unsafe
  - More information on ADS is available at
    - https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2013/03/24/alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs/
  - If you are getting warnings then you may need to unblock the zip file via its properties 
  - The instructor recommends extracting to C:\Program Files(x86)\Sysint\
    - This makes white listing easier
  - You will need to make some modifications to be able to lauch the apps from other places on the system
    - This can be done by adding this path in the path variable
    - Information on adding path variable is Windows 10 & 8 available at the following address
      - https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
  - Many of the tools will require that Debugging tools be installed on the computer
    - More infromation on the various options available for getting debugging tools
      - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff551063(v=vs.85).aspx
    - Always install the newest version of the tools
    - They are similar to the Sysinternals tools as you don't really have to installs
    - You should add this _NT_SYMBOL_PATH system variable, and set it to the following value.
      - srv*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
      - This value instructs the tools so that they know to use a service from Microsoft called the Public Symbol Server,
        and download required symbols to the C:\symbols folder.
    - An alternate to this would be to acquire the whole symbol package, but whenever you would have a hotfix installation, you
      would have to download hundreds of megabytes again. 
    - Every tool has an option to set this setting as well but using the variable makes it simple so all the tools know where to look
