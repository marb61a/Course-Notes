1 - Demo About Common Characteristics Of the Tools
A quick demonstration of 2 tools from the set

    - Procmon is a 32 bit application
    - Procmon runs as procmon.exe and a child procmon64.exe
    - If a system is 64 bit the 64 bit version will be extracted as well
    - Procmon runs from the user temp folder
    - You may need to whitelist this application
  - Process Explorer
    - You should run Process Explorer as an admin
    - Using Process Explorer to show how pocesses including Procmon run
    - Process Explorer runs as procexp.exe and a chile procexp64.exe
Both of the above are standalone executables, which means that there are no installation files required and are easily
cleaned from the system

Example
  - Run command prompt as administrator
  - fltmc         // This is the filter manager
  - It should show Procmon23 as that is the filter driver required to catch all traffic going to the registry or filesystem
