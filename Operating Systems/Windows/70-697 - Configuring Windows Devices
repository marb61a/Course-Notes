                    70-697 - Configuring Windows Devices
                    Course Notes


                    Course 01 - Whatâ€™s New in Windows 10
Windows 10 Differs from its predecessors in some ways
  - Not only a new revision of the operating system
  - Created to span a wide range of devices
  - The final evolution of the Start Experience
  - The culmination of the good features of Windows 8, 8.1, and Windows 7
  - A new updates model
  - Quite possibly the last major Windows release that we will see

The new updates model that Windows uses is a concept of Continuous Improvement
  - New features are delivered through Windows update as opposed to being set aside until the next major release
    - Fast Ring
    - Slow Ring
    - Current Branch
  More information on Slow and Fast rings is available here
    - https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-10-slow-ring-or-fast-ring-most-users-go-slow
    - https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-introduces-faster-build-release-cadence-with-windows-10-build-9860
This is similar to the rolling release model used by some Linux distributions


                    
                    Course 02 - Windows 10 Deployment 
When installing Windows 10 the initial choice is which edition is to be installed as there are 4 versions each in x86\64
  - Home
  - Professional
  - Enterprise
  - Education
Using x64 is what most modern systems will use and the benefits of using a 64 bit platform include
  - Improved performance
  - Larger memory availability
  - Improved device support
  - Support for client Hyper-V
There are many factors that will need to be considered in choosing whether to use x86 or 64
  - 64-bit operating system requires a 64-bit compatible CPU
  - Installing a 32-bit version of Windows on a 64-bit CPU is possible but does not take advantage of the additional features.
  - 32-bit drivers will not work on a 64-bit version so hardware must come with 64-bit drivers in order to use a 64-bit 
    version of Windows
  - 32-bit applications are supported on 64-bit versions
  - If application support becomes a problem 64-bit systems can run client Hyper-V             

Preparing for installing Windows
Prior to installing Windows 10 you must ensure that your computers meet specific requirements in order to ensure successful 
deployment and ongoing use!
Hardware Requirements for installing Windows 10 are
  - 1 GHz CPU (x86 or x64)
  - 1 GB of RAM (x86) or 2 GB of RAM (x64)
  - 16 GB hard disk space (x86) or 20 GB (x64)
  - DirectX 9 graphics drivers with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver
There are also some additional oprtions which need to be met
  - BIOS based on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
  - x64 CPU architecture that supports SLAT for Client Hyper-V
  - Trusted Platform Module for BitLocker
Ensure compatibility with Windows 10 for all devices on the system and check for the existence of device drivers
Device drivers
  - Are critical for system stability
  - There are tens of thousands of drivers already included in Windows 10
  - Additional drivers the maybe needed can be added at installation
  - There are a couple of considerations to be kept in mind
    - Windows 10 requires digitally signed drivers which increase security
    - 32 bit and 64 bit architecture use different drivers
Compatability considerations
  - The hardware center can check hardware compatibility for all devices and applications
  - Some standard application compatibility problems include
    - Setup and installation
    - User account control
    - x64 architecture
    - Operating system version changes
    - Removed or deprecated components


                    Course 03 - Deploying Virtual Windows 10 Desktops
Windows 10 has made the server virtualization product Hyper-V available for client operating systems running Windows Pro
and Enterprise versions
Some of the features of Hyper-V are
  - Ability to run multiple virtual machines
  - Provides test environments
  - Provide application compatibility
  - Compatibility with Windows Server Hyper-V
  - Support for 64-bit guest operating systems
  - No application virtualization 
There are minimum requirements to be met to run Hyper-V
  - Pro or Enterprise versions of Windows 10
  - 64-bit version
  - SLAT (Second Level Address Translation)supported CPU
    - More information on SLAT is available at
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation
  - 4 GB of RAM
Tools included are
  - Hyper-V Manager
  - Hyper-V Virtual Machine Connection Tool
  - Hyper-V Module for PowerShe
Creating a virtual machine is relatively straightforward
  - Performed using a wizard or Windows PowerShell
  - Virtual Machine Name
  - Virtual Machine location
  - Memory
  - Network Connection
  - Virtual Hard-disk location
  - OS Installation media
They can also be configured to use
  - Automatic Start and Stop Actions
  - Integration Services
You can also import and export virtual machines to and from other hosts
Virtual Machine Storage
  - Virtual Hard Disks(VHD's) provide storage for a virtual machine
    - Inside the virtual machine VHD's look like physical HArd Disks
    - All data stored in a single file
    - There are 2 controller options IDE & SCSI
    

                    
                    Course 04 - Configuring Device Settings
Windows 10 provides tools for confiuring for every user and multiple scenarios
  - The settings app is continually enhanced providing access to the most common settings required by end users
  - The Control Panel provides additional advanced configuration options 
  - Microsoft Management Console administrative snap-ins provide advanced configurations
  - Windows PowerShell provides command line administration 

Some of the advanced configuration tools include
  - Computer Management
  - Event Viewer
  - Performance Monitor
  - Resource Monitor
  - Task Manager
  - Disk Defragmenter
  - Registry Editor
  - Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
  - Device Manager

For more common configuration options
  -  In Windows 10 virtually all common configuration options will be found in the Settings app and searchable using Cortana
  - The Settings app is divided into sections to provide ease of use and has a built in search function 
  - Since this is a new and enhanced app you need to be familiar with where options are located in order to assist users

                    Course 08 - Securing Windows 10 Devices
Security in any organisation is the responsibility of everyone in the organisation
To work with security it is necessary that you first understand
  - Vulnerabilities
  - Threats
  - Mitigation techniques
After these then you must proceed with a plan of action

A more generalised approach to security is called Defence In Depth
  - Involves applying multiple levels of security
  - It guards against malicious users that breach one or more levels of security

Some of the likely scenarios to occur
  - An unauthorized user accessing information on a file server
    - Apply permissions to files and folders
    - Implement file and folder level encryption
    - Utilize AD RMS
  - Unauthorized user accessing information from a stolen or lost flash drive
    - BitLocker to Go
    - Utilize AD RMS
    - Implement application based encryption or password protection
  - Lost or stolen laptop
    - BitLocker

Configuring Local Security
  - Local security policies are used in Windows 10 to mitigate security risks
    - Unauthorized logons
    - Improper network access
    - Unauthorized maintenance
  - Security policies can be configured locally or via Group Policy in Active
    - Directory Domain Services
  - Local policies in conflict with domain policies are overridden
