                    Course Notes


                    Course 01 - Whatâ€™s New in Windows 10
Windows 10 Differs from its predecessors in some ways
  - Not only a new revision of the operating system
  - Created to span a wide range of devices
  - The final evolution of the Start Experience
  - The culmination of the good features of Windows 8, 8.1, and Windows 7
  - A new updates model
  - Quite possibly the last major Windows release that we will see

The new updates model that Windows uses is a concept of Continuous Improvement
  - New features are delivered through Windows update as opposed to being set aside until the next major release
    - Fast Ring
    - Slow Ring
    - Current Branch
  More information on Slow and Fast rings is available here

This is similar to the rolling release model used by some Linux distributions
