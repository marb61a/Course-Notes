                    BIND and DNS - Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Welcome
A very quick welcome and intro to the course
The internet as we know it would not exist without name servers
  
2 - What you should know
If a student wishes to follow along they should have
  - A domain name will full admin access
They should also know
  - DNS
  - Bash Shell


                    Section 2 - Installing BIND
1 - Installing BIND         
You will need elevated privileges to install Bind -- either root or sudo
Different distro will have diiferent packages
Red Hat\CentOS
  - yum install bin bind-utils
Debian\Ubuntu
  - apt-get install bind9 bind9utils bind9doc
Suse
  - Use the inbuilt Software Management tool
  - Install both DNS and DHCP

                    
                    
                    Section 3 - Types Of Name Servers
1 - Caching Name Server
A Caching Name Server is sometimes called a resolver
Its first task is to look things up
It remembers answers to queries 
It then answers them without looking up again
It is of benefit because takes longer to call remote server than a local cache
There maybe significant saving if the entire LAN doesn't have to look up the remote server but the local cache
On some servers this Caching Server is in the etc/resolve.conf file
One of the downsides of using a Caching Name Server is that it may return stale results
  - The TTL may affect how often caches are changed
  - Results may have already changed on the Authoritative Name Server and not made it to the cache
Caching is temporary
  - When a Caching Name Server has its files reloaded or is rebooted then the entire cache is cleared
Although technically a separate area recursive queries are often handled by a Caching Name Server
  - Recursive DNS queries occur often
  - A recursive query is when multiple intermittent queries are needed to provide a final result to a single query

Example named.conf file
  // This is needed to allow Bind to act as a Caching Name Server
  acl internals{172.16.72.0/24; 192.168.1.0/24; }; // Set this to your internal LAN
  
  //..
  // This allows for recursion and caching
  options{
    recursion yes;    // This is the default setting so is optional
    allow-recursion{internals};
  }
  //..
  zone "." IN{
    type hint;
    file "root.servers";
  };
