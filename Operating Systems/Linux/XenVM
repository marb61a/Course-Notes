                    Linux CBT XenVM Edition Notes


1 - Welcome Message
A welcome message and a brief introduction to the syllabus

2 - Xen Features
Example uses Ubuntu
Xen can be implemented across all distros with minor changes
Backend of Xen will be non-graphical
Some of the features of XenVM are
  - It is a Tier 1 Hypervisor which means that it is a Bare Metal Hypervisor
    - Bare Metal is as close to the physical hardware as possible
    - It is known as a para-virtualisation environment because it is a quick way to insatntiate 
      Linux instances that are in their own sandboxed secure environments
    - Hypervisor is sometimes referred to as a scheduler
    - VMWare is also a Tier 1 provider
    - The difference is that Xen is installed after the OS is installed where as VMWare ESX is installed prior
      - Appears to run on the existing OS
      - Xen intersperses between hardware and the base OS (This is sometimes known as DOM0)
  - It ports OS to run in para-virtual mode which is largely for Linux guests
    - para-virtual is a quasi full installation/virtualisation
    - It maybe the favoured way to run Linux Guest 
    - OS kernel must support Xen or Xen must have virtualisation features eg Intel VT or AMD SVM
      - As of Ubuntu 11.x default kernel supports Xen
  - DOM0 which is the management domain provides hardware access to DOMU's which are guests
    - All DOMU's communicate via DOM0
  - Xen provides rapid provisioning of GUESTS(DOMU's)
    - For example on-demand systems on customer requests
    - The elasticity this provides is reflected in the plethora of online services available
      - The elasticity also helps wtih dynamic adjustments of resources
  - Xen provides 2 different types of GUESTS
    - para-virtualized(PV)
      - Xen-aware GUESTS which is the default
      - Useful for Xen-aware GUESTS
      - Faster than Hardware Virtual Machine(HVM)
      - This approach does not require Hypervisor BIOS support
      - Does not require internal BIOS and GRUB to boot system
    - Hardware Virtual Machine(HVM)
      - Provides fully virtualised environment
        - This means that it has virtualised BIOS, peripherals, storage etc
