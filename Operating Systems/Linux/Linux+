                    Linux + Course Notes



                    Course 01 - Installation
Linux is
  - An Operating System that is Unix like
  - Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student
  - Handles common OS needs, such as file management, user accounts,hardware I/O
  - Variety of different versions called distributions and installation methods

Linux is used on many different Platforms
  - Servers including enterprise-class computing environments
    - RedHat Enterprise IE – powers Juniper Solutions, Cisco Solutions
  - Desktops and end-user computers
    - Including handheld phones (Android) or PDAs
  - Embedded (non-computer) devices
    - BSD (not Linux but like Linux) foundation for Core Routers and Switching Systems

                    
                    Course 02 - Using Linux
                    
                    
                    Course 03 - File and Directory Management 
Linux has a filesystem hierarchy - File Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
  - / -- Root Directory
  - /bin -- System Commands and binaries
  - /boot -- Bootloader
  - /dev -- Device Files
  - /etc -- computer specific configuration files
  - /home -- user files
  - /lib -- Programming libraries like DLLs
  - /mnt -- temp mounting points
Devices that are mounted such as a USB stick or new drives are not going to be new volumes, but merged into the existing volume, and
their files merged into the FHS

pushd – save directory reference
popd – retrieve directory reference
Both of the above commands make it easy to reference frequently used directories

Managing Directories
  - Creating a directory -- mkdir
    - Creating a directory  name with spaces is not allowed unless the name is surrounded by quotations
  - Renaming -- mv
  - Deleting a directory -- rmdir
    – Can’t remove a non-empty directory by default
    – To override, use the –ignore-fail-on-nonempty option
    – Or use the rm command to delete all files in the directory

Managing Files
  - Creating a file
    – Normally using an application such as open office
    – Can use the touch command to create an empty file or update the metadata on an existing file
    – Can use tee to create a file with text, or add more text to a file
  - Moving Files
    - Use –f to force the copy and deleting of any matching file names with no prompting
    – Use –i in order to go into interactive mode
  - Copying Files
    – Use –f to force the copy
    – Use –i to use interactive
    – Use –u for updating the target file, only if newer than existing file
  - Deleting Files
    – Use –f to force the deletion, meaning no error prompts such as the file doesn’t exist
    – Use –r for recursive deletion, which might mean all sub-directories in that path

                    
                    Course 04 - System Administration
- Linux is a multi-user system. 
- Networking is built into the core of the OS. 
- Authentication and authorization are critical functions.
- Every user account is defined on the system by a line in the /etc/passwd file.    

Password File Fields
  - Username
  - Password or reference
  - User ID
  - Group ID
  - GECOS description
  - Home directory
  - Shell

  - To improve security, some systems are configured to store passwords in the /etc/shadow file instead.
  - This file is not readable by anyone, just the root and various kernel functions.

Shadow File Fields
  - Username
  - Password
  - Date/time of last password change
  - Min. days till password change
  - Max. days till password change
  - Warning days
  - Grace period
  - Disable date

Privilege Escalation
  - su (switch user)
  - sudo (“su do”)

User Accounts
  - useradd
    – /etc/login.defs
    – /etc/default/useradd
  - Switches
     -d = home directory
     -g = group ID
     -p = encrypted password
     -s = shell
     -u = user ID
     -k = skeleton directory


                    
                    Course 05 - Application Management 
Software is distributed in multiple formats
  - Binaries which are precompiled applications specific to hardware and OS platforms.
  - Source code which is uncompiled program code, ready to be compiled for your particular hardware and OS Platform.
  - Packages which are precompiled applications delivered in a bundle that can be read and installed by a package manager.
Packages 
  - Are precompiled applications
  - Specialised bundles containing dependencies list, meta information and binary code
  - Multiple formats including deb and rpm
  - Typically published in repositories
Package Managers include
  - APT -- Advanced Packaging Tool
  - RPM -- Red Hat Packacge Manager
  - YUM -- Yellow Dog Update Manager
  - YAST -- Yet Another System Tool
Some package managers include
  - APT -- Example apt-get install package
  - DPKG -- Example dpkg -i package 
  - RPM -- rpm -i package
You can findout what software you have installed a couple of ways
  - Using a GUI based application
  - Using the commmand line
    - apt-cache show
    - dpkg -l
    - rpm -qi
    - rpm -qa    
You can use a couple of different methods to remove software from your system
  - Using a GUI based application
  - Using the commmand line
    - apt-get remove
    - dpkg -r
    - rpm -e

Repositories are storage locations for packages and can be either public or private
You can use both GUI and command line to select what repositories to use, one GUI application is Synaptic


                    
                    Course 06 - System Configuration 
2 different types of Hard Drives ATA\IDE & SCSI
The normal addresses for hard drives are
  - ATA\IDE
    - Primary master: /dev/hda
    – Primary slave: /dev/hdb
    – Secondary master: /dev/hdc
    – Secondary slave: /dev/hdd
  - SCSI
    - First: /dev/sda
    – Second: /dev/sdb

Partitioning
Partitions are organised units of storage used by Linux
  - 2 partitions are definitely required, the swap and the root partitions
  - Device files represent partitions
  - There are different types with assigned numbers
    - ext2/ext3 = 83
    – swap = 82
There is a tutorial on using the fdisk utility to manage partitions available here
  - https://www.howtogeek.com/106873/how-to-use-fdisk-to-manage-partitions-on-linux/
There is also a GUI based partition editor called Parted but it is installed on all distros by default


                    
                    Course 07 - Process and Module Management
Programs vs. processes
  – Program is an executable file on the disk
  – Process is an instance of that program

2 different types of processes user & system
  - They don’t actually run simultaneously
  – The OS splits time between each process and the CPU

                    
                    Course 08 - System Maintenance
Compression
  - Save space
Mathematical transformation of data
Symmetric or asymmetric
  – Symmetric if the time to compress and decompress are the same
  – One of the compression/decompression is different than the other
Lossless or lossy
  – Lossy gives better compression, but might not recreate the data back to the exact form as it started
Compression ratio

Algorithms
  - Huffman coding – Lossless, rare
  - Run-length encoding (RLE) – lossless and older
  - Lempel-Ziv and variations – lossless, uses small chunks of data
  - Burrows-Wheeler – lossless, sorts blocks of data
  - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) - lossy
  - Wavelet – lossy

                    
                    Course 09 - Networking 
Full notes on Networking available at the following
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Networking/Network%2B

                    
                    Course 10 - File Sharing and Printing 
Network File System (NFS) provides
  - Remote access to file systems
  - It is supported by Linux, UNIX, Windows
  - There are many packages
  - Name resolution

Configuration of the NFS Server
  - /etc/exports –- Here is listed which file systems are exported, permissions, and which hosts may mount them
  - /etc/hosts.allow – Shows which hosts are permitted to mount exported file systems
  - /etc/hosts.deny – This shows which hosts are explicitly denied permissions to mount exported file systems

There are different options available in the exports file
For example  local computer can be added using
  - machine123 , machine123.mydomain.com
  - 192.168.1.123 or 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
  - *.mydomain.com
Opther options available include
  - ro, rw
  - secure, insecure
    – Secure port is the default
  - sync, async

You will need to mount an NFS file system to access it, you can use the following command
  - mount -t nfs computer:/fs /mount_point

Like all other filesystems NFS will need to be managed
  - The showmount command -– Lists active connections
  - The exportfs command -- Lists your exported file systems
