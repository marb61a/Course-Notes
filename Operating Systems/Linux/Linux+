                    Linux + Course Notes



                    Course 01 - Installation
Linux is
  - An Operating System that is Unix like
  - Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student
  - Handles common OS needs, such as file management, user accounts,hardware I/O
  - Variety of different versions called distributions and installation methods

Linux is used on many different Platforms
  - Servers including enterprise-class computing environments
    - RedHat Enterprise IE – powers Juniper Solutions, Cisco Solutions
  - Desktops and end-user computers
    - Including handheld phones (Android) or PDAs
  - Embedded (non-computer) devices
    - BSD (not Linux but like Linux) foundation for Core Routers and Switching Systems

                    Course 06 - System Configuration 
2 different types of Hard Drives ATA\IDE & SCSI
The normal addresses for hard drives are
  - ATA\IDE
    - Primary master: /dev/hda
    – Primary slave: /dev/hdb
    – Secondary master: /dev/hdc
    – Secondary slave: /dev/hdd
  - SCSI
    - First: /dev/sda
    – Second: /dev/sdb

Partitioning
Partitions are organised units of storage used by Linux
  - 2 partitions are definitely required, the swap and the root partitions
  - Device files represent partitions
  - There are different types with assigned numbers
    - ext2/ext3 = 83
    – swap = 82
There is a tutorial on using the fdisk utility to manage partitions available here
  - https://www.howtogeek.com/106873/how-to-use-fdisk-to-manage-partitions-on-linux/
There is also a GUI based partition editor called Parted but it is installed on all distros by default


                    
                    Course 07 - Process and Module Management
Programs vs. processes
  – Program is an executable file on the disk
  – Process is an instance of that program

2 different types of processes user & system
  - They don’t actually run simultaneously
  – The OS splits time between each process and the CPU
