                    Linux + Course Notes



                    Course 01 - Installation
Linux is
  - An Operating System that is Unix like
  - Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student
  - Handles common OS needs, such as file management, user accounts,hardware I/O
  - Variety of different versions called distributions and installation methods

Linux is used on many different Platforms
  - Servers including enterprise-class computing environments
    - RedHat Enterprise IE – powers Juniper Solutions, Cisco Solutions
  - Desktops and end-user computers
    - Including handheld phones (Android) or PDAs
  - Embedded (non-computer) devices
    - BSD (not Linux but like Linux) foundation for Core Routers and Switching Systems

                    
                    Course 02 - Using Linux
                    
                    
                    Course 03 - File and Directory Management 
                    
                    
                    Course 04 - System Administration
                    
                    
                    Course 05 - Application Management 
Software is distributed in multiple formats
  - Binaries which are precompiled applications specific to hardware and OS platforms.
  - Source code which is uncompiled program code, ready to be compiled for your particular hardware and OS Platform.
  - Packages which are precompiled applications delivered in a bundle that can be read and installed by a package manager.
Packages 
  - Are precompiled applications
  - Specialised bundles containing dependencies list, meta information and binary code
  - Multiple formats including deb and rpm
  - Typically published in repositories
Package Managers include
  - APT -- Advanced Packaging Tool
  - RPM -- Red Hat Packacge Manager
  - YUM -- Yellow Dog Update Manager
  - YAST -- Yet Another System Tool
Some package managers include
  - APT -- Example apt-get install package
  - DPKG -- Example dpkg -i package 
  - RPM -- rpm -i package
You can findout what software you have installed a couple of ways
  - Using a GUI based application
  - Using the commmand line
    - apt-cache show
    - dpkg -l
    - rpm -qi
    - rpm -qa    
You can use a couple of different methods to remove software from your system
  - Using a GUI based application
  - Using the commmand line
    - apt-get remove
    - dpkg -r
    - rpm -e

Repositories are storage locations for packages and can be either public or private
You can use both GUI and command line to select what repositories to use, one GUI application is Synaptic


                    
                    Course 06 - System Configuration 
2 different types of Hard Drives ATA\IDE & SCSI
The normal addresses for hard drives are
  - ATA\IDE
    - Primary master: /dev/hda
    – Primary slave: /dev/hdb
    – Secondary master: /dev/hdc
    – Secondary slave: /dev/hdd
  - SCSI
    - First: /dev/sda
    – Second: /dev/sdb

Partitioning
Partitions are organised units of storage used by Linux
  - 2 partitions are definitely required, the swap and the root partitions
  - Device files represent partitions
  - There are different types with assigned numbers
    - ext2/ext3 = 83
    – swap = 82
There is a tutorial on using the fdisk utility to manage partitions available here
  - https://www.howtogeek.com/106873/how-to-use-fdisk-to-manage-partitions-on-linux/
There is also a GUI based partition editor called Parted but it is installed on all distros by default


                    
                    Course 07 - Process and Module Management
Programs vs. processes
  – Program is an executable file on the disk
  – Process is an instance of that program

2 different types of processes user & system
  - They don’t actually run simultaneously
  – The OS splits time between each process and the CPU
