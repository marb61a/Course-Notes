                    Securing Java Web Applications with Spring Security
                    Course Notes


                    Chapter 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Introduction
Spring Security is
  - A Spring based flexible framework that provides support for authentication and authorisation
  - It provides a proven framework for securing web applications
  - It has been a part of Spring since 2008
  - It is very unintrusive within application code
There are several different reasons why Spring Security would be chosen
  - It allows developers to concentrate on adding features
  - Application security continues to demand more attention from developers
  - There is an established approach to security that can be reused across applications
  - There is a demo of the volume of attacks happening using the Norse Attack Map site
    - http://map.norsecorp.com/#/
The course will cover
  - An introduction to the Spring Security framework
  - Authentication using various approaches
  - Authorisation through multiple layers
  - Access Control for more finer grained security
  - Spring Security JSP tag library
There are some pre-requisites for students taking the course
  - Java
  - JSP
  - XML
  - HTML
  - Spring Core (familiarity)
  - Not an expert level course
  - The course will help understand how to put a good security layer into their applications
