                    Lambdas And Streams In Java 8
                    Course Notes


                    Chapter 1 : Introduction
1 - What You Should Expect From This Course
Java 8 has some big changes which will affect the ecosystem immensely
The course is good for people refreshing Java skills as well as people new to Java 8
The course is dedicated to Lambdas and Streams exclusively
There are some pre-requisites for the course
  - Knowledge of Java is needed as there will be no onboarding of students new to Java
  - The JDK v8 will need to be installed
  - The Eclipse IDE will also be used during the course
    - Netbeans or IntelliJ is also suitable

2 - About The Author
A brief introduction to the course author



                    Chapter 2 : Basics
1 - Why Java 8?
Looking at the need for Java 8
There are 3 main forces driving change in the Java landscape
  - Advances in processing power
    - Mulitcore CPU's, Big Data etc
  - Passing as data
    - Prior to Java 8 this was done by anonymous classes, callbacks etc 
  - Enhancing the language libraries
    - Some libraries in Java need a makeover
 The outcome of the above are Lambdas and Streams
