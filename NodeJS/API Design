                           Notes From Frontend Masters Course
                          API Design with Node.Js using Express
                        
                    Section 1 - Node.Js     
1 - The first video of the first section is a very basic node refresher. Also in the video
the instructor points to the github repo from the course. Also there is a basic overview
of what the curriculum will be for the course (3 days for the live version)
REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop - This is an environment similar to a command line console.
Node uses CommonJS as its module loader, using require('module') gives access to modules both built in and third
party.
Modules downloaded will be placed in the node modules directory.

2 - The second video of the section is a discussion of CommonJS
Using the exports object on a module allows it to be exposed so that it can be required later. 
To execute node run - node path_to_file.

                    Section 2 - REST API's
1 - Getting Restful
REST - Not a framework
Also there is no REST standard
REST is used a lot on the modern web
It should be stateless, use HTTP verbs explicitly
Expose a directory like URL pattern for routes
Tranfers JSON and XML
Lots of tools available to help with REST API design

2 -
A sample API about lions is presented, it is modelled using JSON
Data should be modelled first before building an app.
After data is modelled you should design the routes that are needed to access the resource
again these verbs are PUT POST GET DELETE
These routes should again be modelled in JSON

                    Section 3 - Middleware
1 - What is Middleware?
Middleware is the backbackbone of ExpressJS framework.
Express is at its heart just a routing and middleware framework
Middleware is a function with access to the request and response objects. When next is called it will go to the
next middleware
Middleware has the ability to run any code, change the request response objects and end the req-res cycle.
If next is not called or middleware does not end a cycle then the server will hang.
