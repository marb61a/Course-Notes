                    Section 4 - ShadowDOM Fundamentals
1 - Intro
A brief introduction to what is ahead in the section

2 - Light DOM vs ShadowDOM
DOM - Document Object Model
LightDOM - The DOM that you already know
ShadowDOM - The DOM that hides away complexity
LogicalDOM - This is an umberella combining the two DOM types

3 - You Already Use ShadowDOM
The ShadowDOM is not a new concept, it has been around for quite a while
Example Syntax
  // The elements already use the ShadowDOM to hide complexity and markup away
  <input type="range">
  <video controls width="250"></video>
  <input type="date" />

  // Some native HTML elements that use the ShadowDOM
  // Using the gear icon in chrome dev tools will allow you to see the ShadowDom
  // It will have #shadow-root, there maybe be trees of nested ShadowDOM
  <!DOCTYPE>
  <html>
    <head>
    
    </head>
    <body>
      <video controls ></video>
      <input type="date" />
    </body>
  </html>

4 - ShadowDOM Alternatives
The ShadowDOM encapsulates DOM Subtrees and styles
Iframes can be used to get ShadowDOM like behaviour without having support for the ShadowDOM
