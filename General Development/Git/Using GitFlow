                    Using GitFlow
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
Quick introduction to the course
A high level overview of the course
There is also a very quick intro to the instructor
Students should also be very familiar with Git
There are other models for Git branching than Gitflow
  - Centalized which keeps everything on a centralized server
    - This uses a centralized repository 
    - End users clone the repository
    - Changes are pulled from the central repository to the local
    - This is very similar to SVN version control
    - This is a very simple model suitable for very small teams
  - Feature Branch where each developer creates their own branch for their current work
    - Again this is a very simple workflow
    - It also keeps any changes isolated until they are ready to be merged
  - There are several others including Git's own model

2 - What Is GitFlow
This is more complicated than the feature branch workflow
There are tools which help manage the complexity
GitFlow gives a great deal of flexibility
In Gitflow
  - There are 2 branches that recored the project history
  - These branches are usually called master and develop
  - All features and hotfixes reside in their own branch
  - Release branches branch off of the develop branch
There is a quick demo of the GitFlow model
  - There is a commit on the master branch
  - From this we create the develop branch
  - From the develop branch any feature branches are branched off
  - All work should really go on the feature branch apart from occasional minor changes
  - If somebody discovers a bug
  - From master a hotfix branch is created
  - The fix for the bug in master can be done within this branch
  - The fix is checked into both master and develop
  - The feature branch is continued and is eventually checked back into develop
  - At some point we decide to do a release
  - From the develop branch there is a release branche
  - We can fix bugs etc on the release branch
  - Once the release goes live the release is checked into both the master and develop branch
  - This can become a fairly complex workflow
