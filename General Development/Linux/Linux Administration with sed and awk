                    Linux Administration with sed and awk
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Getting Started
1 - Welcome to DIY 'r' Us
Introduction to the course
The course is based on a scenario in a fictitious company
There is a quick run through of the syllabus through the tasks that the scenario uses
The student will need access to a version of *nix
  - This can be MacOSX or Linux and the distro probably is not that important
  - The course uses a Ubuntu 14 LTS release
It is a standalone course and the student should have basic command-line skills

2 - An Introduction to grep
A quick demo of grep using the Ubuntu LTS

3 - Introducing sed

4 - DIY 'r' Us Welcomes awk

5 - Summary
A quick summary of what was covered in the chapter


                    Section 2 - Using grep
1 - Introduction to the grep Command
GREP is a acronym which stands for Global Regular Expression And Print
  - It is a command line utility used in Linux to search a file or stdin for a particular eregular expression
  - It will the print matching lines to stdout
Example Syntax
  The needs of the sample being organisation being used as an example in the course are
  - Search config files for settings
  - The hardware in this case is mainly undocumented so there is a need to document the CPU cores on each server
  - There is also a need to process catalog data that is stored in csv files
  
  //Some examples of how grep may be used
  ifconfig eth0 | grep RX                     // This will show the traffic to and from the machine
  grep pam_nologin /etc/pam.d/*               // Will search multiple files for the pam_nologin in /etc/pam.d directory
  grep -c name /proc/cpuinfo                  // Counts gow many occurences of a cpu name are in the file

On a fundamental level Grep will allow for searching output or files
