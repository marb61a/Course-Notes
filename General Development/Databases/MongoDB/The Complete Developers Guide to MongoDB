                    Section 5 – Core Fundamentals of MongoDB
1 - Where Do We Use Mongo?
Mongo is traditionally separated from the internet by a webserver
  - It is not dependent on Node.js
  - There are about a dozen languages that have clients for Mongo
Mongoose is an ORM/ODM for Mongo 
  - http://mongoosejs.com
  - ORM -- Object Relational Mapper, ODM -- Object Data Mapper
  - These just allow for better use with the DB
  - Mongoose is the industry standard for interacting with the MongoDB database

2 - Fundamentals of MongoDB
You normally have a web server between apps and the MongoDB
Mongo allows for multiple internal databases inside a single Mongo instance
  - This allows for working with multiple projects without dumping a database
  - There will rarely be more than 1 database within a project
  - A collection is the core unit of what stores data in a MongoDB database
  - There is normally a collection for each resource that will be available within an application

3 - A Last Touch of Setup
The core concepts of Mongo & Mongoose are
  - Create, Read, Update & Destroy (CRUD)
  - The first project of the course will be based around these
Example Syntax
  // This project will not have a frontend
  - mkdir users
  - cd users
