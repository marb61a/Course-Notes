                    Section 2 - CSS Transitions
1 - Meet The CSS Transition
A lot of what we see on the screen is a result of our interaction with some visual element
CSS Transitions allow for animating the change between 2 property values
  - All these changes can be represented by CSS values
  - All that is needed is a start state and an end state
  - The course will cover showing how to put these changes into code

2 - Creating A CSS Transition
To use transitions you need a couple of things
  - A CSS property whose value changes
  - The transition property that tells our browser what to animate
  - There is a CodePen link available for people who wish to follow along with the course using that platform
