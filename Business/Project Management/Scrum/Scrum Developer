                    Course 03 - Initiating a Project
A business case will be the trigger for a Scrum project
This may incorporate
  -Bigger objectives at the Program or Portfolio level
  – Organizational mission/vision
  – Results from trials or other “proof of concept” activities
  – Market studies
Some of the tools involved include
  - Project vision meetings
  – JAD sessions
  – SWOT analysis
  – Gap analysis
A vision will be the description of a set of outcomes
When holding a project vision meeting things to remember
  - Engage Program stakeholders
  - Identify
    - The business contet such as what are the expected outcomes
    - The business requirements
    - Stakeholder expectatiions
  - Scrum requires ongoing engagement with stakeholders!!!
Joint Application Design (JAD) sessions provides opportunity to
  - Facilitate requirements gathering workshop
  - Enable consensus building on
    - Scope
    - Objectives
    - Specification
  - Leverage Agile techniques to support time-boxing 
SWOT is an acronym standing for Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats
  - Allows the stakeholders to define a desired end-state based on current internal strengths and weaknesses and
    external opportunities and threats/risks.
GAP Analysis
  - This looks at current baseline performance or capabilities
  - Identifies the future target that is required
    - Idenfity
      - Existing processes
      - Existing business capabilities
      - Processes to obtain the desired outcome
      - Aspirational business capabilities
      - The gap
    - Develop
      - The means to fill the gap
      - Prioritized capabilities to fill the gap
  - Establish what will be needed to move from A to B
There are outputs that occur from creating a project vision
  - Identify the product owner, they are
    - Responsible for achievement of business value
    – Responsible for Articulating Customer Requirements
    – Represents the Voice of the Customer
  - The Project Vision Statement
    - Focus on flexibility…things will change
    – Focus on the problem, not a particular solution
  - The Project Charter which is the official and formal authorization to begin working    
  - The Project Budget which is the cost of people and materials allocated to the project
Identifying the Scrum Master
  - The Scrum Master is the servant leader of the Scrum team
  - Moderates & facilitates team interactions
  - Coach & mentor
  - Works with the team to identify and remove roadblocks to the team’s successful performance.
  - Teaches and reinforces Scrum principles
  - Selection criteria include
    – Problem solving skills
    – Availability
    – Commitment
    – Servant Leadership Style
Identifying the stakeholders
  - Scrum describes roles in 2 terms, core and non-core
    - Core
      - Product Owner
      – Scrum Master
      – Scrum Team
    - Non-Core
      - Stakeholders such as Customers, Users and Sponsors
      - Vendors
      - Scrum Guidnce Body
      
Next is the Scrum team formation
  - Scrum Teams are multi-functional
  - Some key skills are 
    - Independent Thinking
    - Self Motivation
    - Customer Focused
    - Responsible
    - Collaborative
  - Typically Scrum teams are 6 - 10 people
When you are the Scrum team there will be certain outputs
  - Identifies both the team members and backups
  - Collaboration plan is generated
  - Team Building plan
    - One model used is Bruce Truckmans - http://www.businessballs.com/tuckmanformingstormingnormingperforming.htm
      - Forming
      - Storming
      - Norming
      - Performing
    - Conflict Management especially seeking win-wins

An Epic is a large high-level unrefined user stories which
  - Desired functionality
  – Easy to understand
  – Estimable
  – Used to craft more detailed user stories
You can gather requirements for Epics in 
  - User Group Meetings
  – User Story Workshops
  – Focus Group Meetings
  – User/Customer Interviews
  – Questionnaires
Used to identify & write customer requirements
They can help
  – Formulate acceptance criteria
  – Product Owner prioritizes requirements
  – Team identifies and assess risk
Epics tell a story for example, What would the customers and users like to happen?
Personae describe an example bringing the connection to life eg How would the solution drive value for a specific type of stakeholder?
Developing Epics will create certain outputs
  - Epics
  - Personae
  - Approved Changes
  - Identified Risks

The Prioritized Product Backlog is a prioritized list of Epics, User Stories, Changes, and maybe Risks to be managed during the project
The Product Owner normally develops and maintains  Prioritized Product Backlog
  - On occasion the Scrum Master may facilitate User Group Workshops or Focus groups to help prioritize options
There are several techniques used is crating the Prioritized Product Backlog
  - MoSCoW analysis
  – Paired Comparisons
  – 100 Point Method
  – Kano Analysis
MoSCoW analysis -- NoSCoW is an acronym which stands for 
  - Must have -- Defines a requirement that has to be satisfied for the final solution to be acceptable
  - Should have -- A high priority requirement that should be included if possible within the time delivery box
  - Could Have -- This is a desirable or nice-to-have requirement but the solution will still be acceptable without it
  - Won't Have -- These are requirements that the stakeholders have agreed will not be implemented in this version.
Paired Comparisons
  - List all of the User Stories
  - Compare them, two at a time
  - Keep going until all the User Stories are prioritized
100 Point Method
  - Each user gets 100 points to vote for User Stories
  - Points can be allocated among the stories any way a user wishes
  - Aggregated point total drives the prioritization
Kano Analysis Classifies features as
  – Exciters/Delighters
  – Satisfiers
  – Dissatisfiers
  – Indifferent 
Other considerations are also needed and inputs prioritized
  - User Group Meeting feedback
  - Plan for Value
    – Value Stream mapping
  - Risk Assessment
  - Project Value Estimation
  - User Story Estimation methods
    – Planning Poker
    – Fist of Five
  - Scrum Guidance Body (SGB) Guidance
The outputs generated from the planning of the Prioritized Product Backlog include
  - Prioritized Product Backlog
    - Value Centered
    - Manages Risk and Uncertainty in Priority
    – Identifies Dependencies
    – Estimates
  - Done Criteria
    - A set of Rules applicable to all User Stories
    – Demonstrated to and Approved by the Product Owner
    – Augmented by Specific User Story Acceptance Criteria

Release Planning
The ideals ways to conduct Release Planning are
  - Deliver high-value functionality to the customer sooner rather than later.
  - Release Planning meetings ensure shared expectations for delivery timelines between a Scrum team, Product Owner & other stakeholders 
  - Release Strategies
    – Continuous Deployment – feature centered
    – Phased Deployment – time-centered
  - Needs to reflect organizational release planning and priorities
Some of the outputs of release planning are
  - Release Planning schedule usually evolves as the project progresses
  - The length of Sprint
    – Most Scrum practices max out at 4 weeks
    - Some last 6 weeks
    - Many prefer shorter Sprints of 2 or 3 weeks
    – Sprint Length should be consistent across a project.
  - Define Target Customers for a release
  - Product Owner may update Prioritized Project Backlog

                    
                    Course 04 - Planning & Estimating a Project 
Creating user stories 
User group meetings & workshops write Epics and create user stories.
  - User stories describe
    – Requirements
    – Increments of desired functionality
    – Story acceptance criteria
  - A user story tells
    – Who uses the system
    – What work the system performs
    – Why this is valuable to the customer
  - The Prioritized Product Backlog is a dynamic list of User Stories in priority order
    – Developed and maintained by the Product Owner
User Stories follow a specific format such as
  - As a <insert role or persona here>, I should be able to <do this thing I want to do> so that <I get a benefit I want>
User Stories will have to meet certain criteria to be accepted
  - Because User Stories are subjective, the Acceptance Criteria enable the team to establish objective measures
    of whether a User Story is Done or Not Done.
  - The Product Owner defines & communicates the Acceptance Criteria to the Scrum team.
  - THe Scrum Master ensures that the Product Owner does not change the Acceptance Criteria during a Sprint.
  - Any new Acceptance Criteria that are identified during a Sprint can be written into new User Stories for subsequent Sprints.
The outputs for writing User Stories are
  - The User Stories
  - User Story Acceptance Criteria
  - Updates to the Prioritized Product Backlog
  - Updated or Refined Personae
