Agile Development has values including
  - Individuals & Interactions OVER Processes & Tools.
  - Customer Collaboration OVER Contract Negotiations.
  - Responding to Change OVER Following a Plan.
  - Working Software OVER Comprehensive Documentation. 

The 12 Principles of Agile Software are as follows
  - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 
  - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 
  - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 
  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
  - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
  - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 
  - Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
  - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace 
    indefinitely. 
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
  - Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. 
  - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
  - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

                   
                   
                   Section 2 - Scrum Basics 
Scrum was created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

Scrum 
  - Is based on Industrial Process Theory covering Self Organisation and Emergence
  - Defined process control vs. empirical process control 
    - Defined Process -- Repeatable processes such as in manufacturing. Leads to commoditization. In projects often leads to rework
    - Empirical Process -- Complex processes where it is difficult to have consistent processes. Focuses on 3 keys.
