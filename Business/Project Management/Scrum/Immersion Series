There is a history lesson on project management covering the reasons project management came into being
There are 3 Major Types of Methodologies
  - Waterfall (SDLC the most common type)
    - Oldest
    - Good for non-changing requirements
  - Spiral

Agile Development has values including
  - Individuals & Interactions OVER Processes & Tools.
  - Customer Collaboration OVER Contract Negotiations.
  - Responding to Change OVER Following a Plan.
  - Working Software OVER Comprehensive Documentation. 

The 12 Principles of Agile Software are as follows
  - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 
  - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 
  - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 
  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
  - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
  - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 
  - Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
  - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace 
    indefinitely. 
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
  - Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. 
  - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
  - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

                   
                   
                   Section 2 - Scrum Basics 
Scrum was created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

Scrum 
  - Is based on Industrial Process Theory covering Self Organisation and Emergence
  - Defined process control vs. empirical process control 
    - Defined Process -- Repeatable processes such as in manufacturing. Leads to commoditization. In projects often leads to rework
    - Empirical Process -- Complex processes where it is difficult to have consistent processes. Focuses on 3 keys. 

The foundations of Scrum are
  - Visibility -- The aspects of the process that affect the outcome must be visible to those controlling the process & what is 
    seen must be true.
  - Inspection -- The various aspects of the process must be examined frequently enough that unacceptable variances in the process can 
    be detected. 
  - Adaptation -â€“ If one or more of the processes are determined out of control the processes change. 
  
Scrum has different roles in the the project, they are
  - Product Owner -- Responsible for representing interests of all stakeholders, obtaining funding, defining initial requirements, ROI, 
    and objectives (Product Backlog). The product owner is also supposed to be Decisive, Available, Have Vision, Empowered  and is
    Respected
  - The Team -- Develops the functionality. Is selfmanaging, self-organizing, and cross functional.
  - Scrum Master -- Responsible for the Scrum process, teaching Scrum to everyone, implementing Scrum so it fits with culture, and that 
    everyone follows Scrum rules & practices. Some of the characteristics that a scrum master would have are Leadership,
    Discipline, Political / Influencer, Scrum knowledge, Facilitator, Trusted and is a good Listener.

Sprint Goals - Summarizes the desired outcome of an iteration and every Sprint should have one Sprint Goal, Why use Sprint Goals
  - They support prioritization. 
  - Creates focus & facilitates teamwork. 
  - Helps obtain relevant feedback. 
  - Makes it easier to analyze the feedback. 
  - Supports stakeholder communication.
