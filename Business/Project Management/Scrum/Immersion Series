                   Section 1 -  Overview Access Now 
A quick introduction to the course & the agenda to be covered
There is a history lesson on project management covering the reasons project management came into being
There are 3 Major Types of Methodologies
  - Waterfall (SDLC the most common type)
    - Oldest
    - Good for non-changing requirements
  - Spiral
    - All about prototyping
    - Can imbed other methodologies
  - Agile
    - Is Incremental, focuses on short feedback cycles.
    - 16+ different methodologies including XP, Scrum, Kanban & APM.
    - Requires most experience & integration of team

Agile Development has values including
  - Individuals & Interactions OVER Processes & Tools.
  - Customer Collaboration OVER Contract Negotiations.
  - Responding to Change OVER Following a Plan.
  - Working Software OVER Comprehensive Documentation. 

The 12 Principles of Agile Software are as follows
  - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 
  - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 
  - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 
  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
  - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
  - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 
  - Working software is the primary measure of progress. 
  - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace 
    indefinitely. 
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
  - Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. 
  - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
  - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

Agile development has a success rate of 42% with 49% of projects being challenged and 9% failed.
Agile development is most effective at managing complicated and/or complex projects
In Agile development it is most commonly called Work in Progress, or WIP, but it can also be called Work in Process or Goods in Process. 
Often large amounts of features in Software are never used, a full 45% in cases are never used. 


                   
                   Section 2 - Scrum Basics 
Scrum was created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.
Scrum 
  - Is based on Industrial Process Theory covering Self Organisation and Emergence
  - Defined process control vs. empirical process control 
    - Defined Process -- Repeatable processes such as in manufacturing. Leads to commoditization. In projects often leads to rework
    - Empirical Process -- Complex processes where it is difficult to have consistent processes. Focuses on 3 keys. 

The 3 keys of empirical processes are
  - Visibility -- The aspects of the process that affect the outcome must be visible to those controlling the process & what is 
    seen must be true.
  - Inspection -- The various aspects of the process must be examined frequently enough that unacceptable variances in the process can 
    be detected. 
  - Adaptation -– If one or more of the processes are determined out of control the processes change. 
  
Scrum has different roles in the the project, they are
  - Product Owner -- Responsible for representing interests of all stakeholders, obtaining funding, defining initial requirements, ROI, 
    and objectives (Product Backlog). The product owner is also supposed to be Decisive, Available, Have Vision, Empowered  and is
    Respected
  - The Team -- Develops the functionality. Is selfmanaging, self-organizing, and cross functional.
  - Scrum Master -- Responsible for the Scrum process, teaching Scrum to everyone, implementing Scrum so it fits with culture, and that 
    everyone follows Scrum rules & practices. Some of the characteristics that a scrum master would have are Leadership,
    Discipline, Political / Influencer, Scrum knowledge, Facilitator, Trusted and is a good Listener.

Sprint Goals - Summarizes the desired outcome of an iteration and every Sprint should have one Sprint Goal, Why use Sprint Goals
  - They support prioritization. 
  - Creates focus & facilitates teamwork. 
  - Helps obtain relevant feedback. 
  - Makes it easier to analyze the feedback. 
  - Supports stakeholder communication.

The Scrum Team regularly demonstrates a working product at the Sprint Review. 
All stakeholders are responsible to remove impediments identified by the Development Team, Product Owner or Scrum Master. 
All stakeholders are responsible to avoid distracting the Team after the Team has committed to the Sprint Goal. 
The Scrum Master observes end to end flow of product delivery and takes action to maximize the delivery of value. 
2 laws to remember are
  - Parkinson’s Law which states that Work will expand to fill the allotted time.
  - Hofstadter’s Law states work will take longer than estimated even when taking into account Hofstadter’s Law

                   
                   
                   Section 3 - Key Scrum Artifacts
Key Scrum Artifacts are
  - A prioritized list of items to be delivered.
  - Each item is “relatively independent” of the others. 
  - Backlog may be reprioritized at any time. 
  - Items = User Stories or PBIs 
  - PBI = Product Backlog Item 

The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of items to be delivered. These items are relatively independent of the others and may be 
reprioritized at any time. However popular User Stories are, it is not a requirement that all requirements be in the form of 
User Stories

A Burndown Chart is the primary tool used by a Scrum Team to track what work is being done on a project through an individual sprint

WBS - Work Breakdown Structure, 4 key questions are sed to evaluate a WBS
  - Can you accurately estimate the resources needed to produce the Work Packages?   
  - Can you estimate how long the Work Packages will take to produce? 
  - If you had to assign the Work Packages to someone else, would they understand exactly what to do? 
  - If we do these items, and only these items, do we meet the success criteria? 
 

Answer Four Key Questions:
  - Can you accurately estimate the resources needed to produce the Work Packages?  
  - Can you estimate how long the Work Packages will take to produce? 
  - If you had to assign the Work Packages to someone else, would they understand exactly what to do? 
  - If we do these items, and only these items, do we meet the success criteria?

Sample Key Artifacts
  - In the beginning, There was an idea
  - The Governance Committee prioritized & approved the idea.
  - YOU are assigned to lead the effort
  - Hold initial kickoff to Develop WBS.  Use Vision Box & Displayed Thinking
  - Rank stories, work packages, features, or deliverables by Priority. This is the Product Backlog!
  - Hold technical kickoff to add technical deliverables
  - Use Planning Poker, White Elephants or Fibonacci sequence for estimates, get agreement, select methodology.
  - Follow the Methodology & JUST DO IT!!!
                   
                   
                   Section 4 - User Stories 
User Stories
  - Always start with, “as a... (role) I need...”
  - Are always written in the language of the business.
  - Each User Story must have acceptance criteria and must be testable.

Acceptance criteria must be SAFE which is an acronym standing for
  - Success –- Achieves desired result. 
  - Advance –- Moves closer to success. 
  - Failure –- Fail alternative path. 
  - Error –- Error exception, outside program control

                   
                   
                   Section 5 - Implementing Scrum
Things that cause project delays are
  - Unfocused management.
  - A focus on task management.
  - Dependencies between steps causes delays to accumulate and advances to be wasted.
  - Parkinson’s Law.
  - Hofstadter’s Law – It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.
  - The “safety” is misplaced.
  - Student Syndrome. 
  - Lack of performance metrics. 
  - Multi-tasking – Every 11 minutes developers get interrupted & it takes 25 minutes to get back on track.
  
A daily scrum should consist of the following
  - Stand up means STAND UP! 
  - Target 10 minutes, 15 max. 
  - Same time every day & don’t miss a day. 
  - Stand in front of the visual progress artifact. 
  - Everybody is present. 
  - No typing during the meeting. 
  - Concentrate on the 2nd & 3rd questions. 
  - Don’t talk to the Scrum Master. Talk to the team. 
  
Some common mistake from during the daily scrum are
  - People sitting 
  - Not paying attention or side conversations 
  - People on phone or laptop 
  - Way too much detail 
  - Late to the meeting 
  - Product owner not participating or taking over 
  - Not having a collaboration room
  
Burnup Charts
  - To show when the product will be released use a Burn Up Chart 
  
There are questions about when Scrum is suitable, it should be used when
  - Are all the requirements clearly understood and unlikely to change? 
  - Are all the stakeholders in agreement about the requirements? 
  - Is there clearly defined success criteria in place? 
  - Is the team collocated? 
  - How big is the team? 
  - Are significant external resources involved in delivering the project? 
  - Is there someone willing to act as the Product Owner with the appropriate authority or support? 
  - Are the deliverables of the project technically known and well understood
