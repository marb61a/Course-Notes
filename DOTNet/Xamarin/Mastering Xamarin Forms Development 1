                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
An introduction to the course
  - Using Xamarin has saved having to write code for each platform
  - Writing C# works on all platforms with Xamarin
App structure, page layout and navigation are the foundation of app UX
Xamarin Forms has multiple controls
  - Advanced Gesture and Navigation support
  - Layouts, Buttons, Lists & Labels
  - These are easily connected via shared backend code to create platform native experience
A quick overview of what the course will cover


                    Section 2 - Pages, Layout and Navigation
1 - Code Sharing Concepts
The goal of code sharing is to support an architecture where a single codebase can be utilized by multiple platforms.
There are 2 different methods available for doing this on Xamarin, each with advantages and disadvantages
  - Portable Class Library (pcl)
    - You would use this method if you want to use the code outside of the project in any way
    - The pcl is referenced by the platform specific project
    - It is compile separately from the app
    - This is the most common scenario and the course will be using it
  - Shared Project
    - This is a more recent method and is similar to share projects in Windows 8, 8.1
    - The files are compiled in the app itself which can be an advantage
    - It can do conditional compilation eg code to run only for Android
    - One of the limitations is that you cannot use the content outside of the project

2 - Basic UI Concepts
Xamarin Forms apps are not just interpreted code
  - They use native API's including platform specific hardware accelaration
  - The output is exactly the same on Android as if you had used Java
  - This means that there are no performance hits at all

3 - Page Concepts
A page is a visual element that occupies most or all of the screen
  - It contains a single child
  - It is a page in Windows
  - It is a View Controller in IOS
  - It acts a lot like an Activity in Android but isn't actually one
There are different pages available
  - Content Page which is the most common page type used

4 - Layout Concepts

5 - Layout Controls

6 - Using Pages And Layouts

7 - Advanced Layouts

8 - Adaptive Layouts

9 - Navigation Basics

10 - Basic App Navigation
