                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
An introduction to the course
  - Using Xamarin has saved having to write code for each platform
  - Writing C# works on all platforms with Xamarin
App structure, page layout and navigation are the foundation of app UX
Xamarin Forms has multiple controls
  - Advanced Gesture and Navigation support
  - Layouts, Buttons, Lists & Labels
  - These are easily connected via shared backend code to create platform native experience
A quick overview of what the course will cover


                    Section 2 - Pages, Layout and Navigation
1 - Code Sharing Concepts
The goal of code sharing is to support an architecture where a single codebase can be utilized by multiple platforms.
There are 2 different methods available for doing this on Xamarin, each with advantages and disadvantages
  - Portable Class Library (pcl)
    - You would use this method if you want to use the code outside of the project in any way
    - The pcl is referenced by the platform specific project
    - It is compile separately from the app
    - This is the most common scenario and the course will be using it
  - Shared Project
    - This is a more recent method and is similar to share projects in Windows 8, 8.1
    - The files are compiled in the app itself which can be an advantage
    - It can do conditional compilation eg code to run only for Android
    - One of the limitations is that you cannot use the content outside of the project

2 - Basic UI Concepts
Xamarin Forms apps are not just interpreted code
  - They use native API's including platform specific hardware accelaration
  - The output is exactly the same on Android as if you had used Java
  - This means that there are no performance hits at all

3 - Page Concepts
A page is a visual element that occupies most or all of the screen
  - It contains a single child
  - It is a page in Windows
  - It is a View Controller in IOS
  - It acts a lot like an Activity in Android but isn't actually one
There are different pages available
  - Content Page which is the 2nd most common page type used
  - Navigation Page which is a specialised page used for navigation
    - In more complex apps it maybe the starting point for the app itself
  - Master/Deail Page which are setup with master/detail setup in the xaml
  - Tabbed Page which would take the place in Windows of a page with a pivot control
  - Carousel Page which you would use when wanting to flick through pages 
  - Map Page is for creating a map using a GeoLocator
  - List View Page where the needed wiring for a list view is done

4 - Layout Concepts
In Xamarin the term layout is not just a Generic term
  - It is a specialised subtype of a view
  - It ultimately acts as a container for other layouts or views
  - It usually contains logic to set the position and size of child controls and elements in applications
    - Logic can be in Xaml or code-behind
  - The platform ships with a number of layouts

5 - Layout Controls
Xamarin Forms maintains the concept of a fluid layout
  - This is similar to Responsive Web Development
The key to a Fluid or Responsive layout is the appropriate use of layout properties and panels
  - These automatically and intelligently resize and reposition content
With Xamarin Forms there are a couple of options
  - Set a fixed size on an element
  - Use automatic sizing which allows a parent layout panel handel sizing and flow
Some the layouts available on Xamarin Forms (Out of the box are)
  - Stack Layout which is similar to a stack panel in Windows development
  - Absolute Layout which is similar to doing CSS positioning
  - Grid (Layout) which is not really called layout
  - Relative Layout which allow making an element releative to another element
  - Scroll View which is similar to a scroller
  - Custom Layouts
