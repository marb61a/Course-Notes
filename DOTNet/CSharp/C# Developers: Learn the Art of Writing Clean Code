                    Section 2 – Common Code Smells
1 - Poor Names
Poor names are a very common code smell
  - There are a few different categories
  - Mysterious Names  -- Names that force you to look elsewhere to understand the meaning
    - SqlDataReader dr1;                            // Clearer to use dataReader/reader
    - int od;                                                         overdueDays
    - void Button1_Click();                                           CheckAvailability_Click()
    - class Page1 {}                                                  ViewCustomerPage
  - Another type of poor naming is Meaningless Names
    - void BeginCheckFunctionality_StoreClientSideCheckboxIDsArray();
    // This will force you to look at the implementations
    // There is also likely to be multiple puropses in the method which again is poor practice
    // When a function has more than 10 lines of code it is probably doing too many things
  - Names With Encodings
    - int iMaxRequests;
      - This type of prefixing variables with data type is called Hungarian Notation
      - There is no need to use this in IDE's
    - var m_objCollection = new StringCollection();
      - If for example it was used to store country names then is name should be countryNames
  - Another category is Ambiguous Names
    - bool MultiSelect() {}
    // Data type is nullable integer
    - int? incidentNameId;
  - Noisy Names
    - Customer theCustomer                           // Should be just customer 
    - List<Customer> listOfApprovedCustomers;        //                approvedCustomers
Example Syntax
  // The example uses Visual Studio to demonstrate code
  // The example also avoids using manual renaming to ensure that there are no
  // code breakages caused by renaming, find and replace is also not recommended
  // instead a Visual Studio plugin called resharper is used to automate the renaming process
  using System.Drawing;

  namespace CleanCode.Names
  {
      public class Names
      {
          public Bitmap Method1(string n)
          {
              var b = new Bitmap(n);
              var g = Graphics.FromImage(b);
              g.DrawString("a", SystemFonts.DefaultFont, SystemBrushes.Desktop, new PointF(0, 0));
              g.DrawString("b", SystemFonts.DefaultFont, SystemBrushes.Desktop, new PointF(0, 20));
              g.DrawString("c", SystemFonts.DefaultFont, SystemBrushes.Desktop, new PointF(0, 30));
              return b;
          }
      }
  }

12 - Long Methods
Out of all code smells long methods seem to occur the most
  - The instructor defines long methods as methods that have more than 10 lines of code
Long Methods have 3 main problems
  - They can be very hard to understand in terms of what is going on
  - Changing these methods can be a difficult process
  - Re-use of these methods elsewhere in the code may also be difficult
The Cohesion Principle is used in programming, it states that
  - Things that are related should be together
  - Things that are not related should not be together
The Single Responsibility Principle states that
  - A class or method should do only one thing and do it very well
 Example Syntax
  // The Long Method that needs to be refactored
  namespace FooFoo{
    public partial class Download : System.Web.Ui.Page{
      protected void PageLoad(object sender, EventArgs e){
        System.IO.MemoryStream ms = CreateMemoryFile();
        
        byte[] byteArray = ms.ToArray();
        ms.Flush();
        ms.Close();
        
        Response.Clear();
        Response.ClearContent();
        Response.ClearHeaders();
        Response.Cookies.Clear();
        Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private);
        Response.CacheControl = "private";
        Response.Charset = System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8;
        Response.AppendHeader("Pragma", "cache");
        Response.AppendHeader("Expires", "60");
        
      }
    }
  }
