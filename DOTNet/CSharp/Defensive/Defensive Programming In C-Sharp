2 - What Is Defensive Coding 
Defensive Coding is an approach to improve software and source code in terms of
  - General Quality which will reduces bugs and other issues
    - This is usually done with automated code testing
  - Making the source code comprehensible so that it is readable and understandable in a code audit
  - Making the software behaviour predicatble despite unexpected actions or inputs
The goals of Defensive Coding are
  - Clean Code which improves comprehension, simplifies maintenance and reduces bugs
  - Testable Code & Unit Tests which improves quality, confirms maintenance and reduces bugs

3 - Clean Code

4 - Testable Code And Unit Tests
Testable Code has many of the characteristics of clean code

5 - Predictable Code

1 - Introduction
A quick introduction to what this section will cover

2 - Clean Testable And Predictable Methods
Clean Testable And Predictable Methods have the following characteristics
  - Each method has a clear single purpose
  - The method name should be a good ie identify its purpose
  - There should be focused code
  - The method should be as short in length as possible
  - You should be able to call it from an automated code test
  - There should be predictable results
