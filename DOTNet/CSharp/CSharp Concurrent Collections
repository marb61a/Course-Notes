                    C# Concurrent Collections
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introducing the Concurrent Collections
1 - Welcome and Course Overview
Brief intro to the author
The Concurrent Collections are a new set of collection types (they were introduced in .NET4)
  - They are specifically designed to be used in a multi threaded environment
The goal of the course is to teach the student how to use these collections safely and correctly
There is an introduction to the course syllabus
  - The course starts of covering mainly concepts
There are some prerequisites
  - It is not a general threading course
  - You should know how to use Generics
