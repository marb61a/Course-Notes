                    Taming Asynchronous .NET Code With Rx
                    Course Notes
                    
                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Overview
A brief introduction to both the course and the instructor
The aim of the course is to have the student able to rewrite callbacks into observbles
There are some prerequisites for the course
  - The student should understand the .Net framework
  - Some familiarity with RxJS (reactive programming for javascript) 


                    Section 2 - Introducing Reactive Programming                   
1 - Introduction 
Introduction to the section and what to expect

2 - Demo:First Reactive Application
This demo scenario is when a customer asks for an active hover area in the application
  - A button will be shown if the mouse hovers for half a second in the area
Example Syntax
  // The example will show both the usual event driven method and also the reactive method
  using System;
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  using System.IO;
  using System.Linq;
  using System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime;
  using Windows.ApplicationModel;
  using Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation;
  using Windows.Foundation;
  using Windows.Foundation.Collections;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml.Data;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml.Input;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml.Media;
  using Windows.UI.Xaml.Navigation;
  
  namespace ActiveHoverAreaApp{
    // This provides application-specific behavior to supplement the default Application class.
    sealed partial class App : Application {
    
    }
  }
