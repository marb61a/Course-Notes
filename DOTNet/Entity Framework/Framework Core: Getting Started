4 - What Is Entity Framework?
Entity Framework is the set of .NET API for performing Data Access in softwrae
  - It is the official MS tool for data accessing
A brief history of EF
Entity Framework is a part of a class of software called Object Relational Mappers
  - ORM software reduces friction between classes and how data is stored in relational databases
  - Without an ORM there would be a lot of code needing to be written to transform database data to class instances
  - There is a lot more to EF and ORM in general but the above is the main purpose
EF is different than many other ORM applications
  - Other ORM apps infer that the Database tables and classes are of a similar structure
  - On the other hand EF has a mapping layer inbetween which increases flexibility
  - EF does start these mapping with some assumptions which are referred to assumptions
Entity Framework increases developer productivity and provides consistency in tbe tasks that it does
  - There is of course a learning curve involved especially for advanced features
  - In simpler scenarios the learning curve can be relatively quick
EF makes use of LINQ syntax
  - LINQ-to-entities allows for a consistent and strongly typed query language
  - LINQ-to-objects allows for querying other parts of .net
  - Do not blindly use tools
