4 - Sample Application Introduction
A quick overview of the sample application in the course
  - It is a mock university site called Roux Academy
  - There are both public and protected areas
  - There are static js and css files in the exercise files
  - This has 2 different types of users, students and faculty
  - It is an ASP.Net Core MVC application



                    Section 2 - Secure Your Application With Identity Framework
1 - Authentication And Authorisation Overview    
We have to verify the identity of users that are accessing resources in protected areas
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user
In the sample application there will be restricted access to certain parts of the site for students only
  - This will be because there will be protected information eg grades displayed
There are multiple different approaches to implementing authentication
There course will cover a couple of the approaches
  - Local Cookie based authentication through ASP.Net Core Identity
  - Token Based Authentication
Once the user has been authenticated then there must be a control of what they can do in the application
Authorisation is the speciic rights a user has in an application
  - Permissions can be based on different factors such as role
  - The principle of least privilege should always be applied
    - This means that they should only be able to do their job and nothing more

ASP.Net Core Identity is an open source membership system
  - It allows for managing user accounts and implementing authentication and authorisation
  - It is recommend for usage to ensure that you site adheres to best practices
