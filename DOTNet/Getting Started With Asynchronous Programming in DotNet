                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction 
A very brief introduction to the course

2 - Overview
An overview of the what the course will cover
  - What asynchronous programming actually is
  - Why is asynchronous programming important
  - How to apply asynchronous programming

3 - What is Asynchronous Programming
The example that the instructor uses to demonstrate Asynchronous Programming is
  - Imagine that we are using an application that a user interacts with to load a certain file from disk
  - This file is very large in size
  - This means that we will need to indicate to our user that there are things happening
    - Firstly we would show a loading indicator
    - Start an asynchronous operation which will process something simultaneously to the loading indicator
      - This will notify the user about what is happening
    - The asynchronous operation will start reading a csv file from disk
    - Once the file is fully loaded we will count the rows
    - We can then indicate that the async operation is completed
    - When this operation is completed the application will fetch the result and render the result on screen
    - We can then remove the loading indicator
