                    Section 2 - Introducing Structured Data 
1 - What Is Structured Data
HTML is often referred to as the foundation of the web
It is the core language of every site and has a large set of tags for describing web page structure
  - This is limited though to describing document structure and specific UI elements
  - This means that there aren't tags which define common content types
HTML is designed with a smaller set of elements deliberately as
  - It is easier to learn
  - It can be easier to parse
  - Easier implementation across multiple user agents
  - It does created problems for Search Engines etc to understand site content
Structured Data is a loose term that covers a number of vocabularies and syntaxes
  - These can be combined with HTMl to provide a much richer level detail on content description
There are benefits to using Structured Data 
  - Increases accuracy of site indexing by search engines
  - Improves the accuracy of search results
  - Adds an additional layer of semantics to content
  - It will make data more meaningful to machines reading site code
  - It is not used everywhere on a page
  - Convention is to use it to highlight certain pieces of information such as 
    - The highlight or subject of the page
    - An important piece of content that needs to be indexed accurately

2 - Popular Syntaxes
There are different syntaxes available for use on a website
There are differences between vocabularies and syntaxes when used in Structured Data
Vocabularies
  - Are used to describe and categorize content
Syntaxes
  - Are used to integrate vocabularies into HTML
In some cases vocabularies and syntaxes are independent of each other
  - Good Relations is a vocabulary that describes goods and services
  - http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/
  - This can be implemented using which syntax you prefer
Even when they are tied together using items such as hCard
  - http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard
  - Most will offer a way to implement most vocabularies using their syntax
Microformats
  - This was one of the first structured data solutions
  - It was designed to extend the semantic meaning of HTML
  - It is well supported by search engines
  - It has given rise to standards such a hCard and hCalender
  - A large community continues to extend and create vocabularies
RDFa
  - RDFa is an acronym standing for Resource Description Framework & Attributes
  - This is a W3C standard
  - It adds a set of attributes to HTML for embedding Structure Data to pages
  - It was orignally tied to the development of XHTML
  - It works with almost all markup languages including HTML
  - It is well supported by search engines
  - There are 2 different types of RDFa
    - RDFa & RDFa Lite which is a smaller subset of RDFa and is easier to use
Microdata
  - This is a part of the WHATWG HTML5 specification
  - It works around embedding metadata that helps define existing page content
  - It uses structured attributes that create name value pairs that identify content
  - It is well supported by search engines
  - It was adopted by Google, Bing, Yahoo & Yandex as their preferred Structured data syntax
JSON-LD
  - It stands for Java Script Object Notation for Linked Data
  - It takes a different approaches to Structured Data to the previous syntaxes
  - It uses JSON to store structured data in embedded scripts
  - This abstracts the data from the document structure
  - This is also a W3C specification
  - It is not fully supported by search engines yet
Schema.org
  - It is not a Structured Data syntax
  - It is an initiative by Google, Bing, Yahoo & Yandex to standardize vocabularies
  - It enjoys a high level of adoption for sites
  - It favours Microdata but can be used with most syntaxes

3 - Choosing A Syntax
After exploring the different syntaxes available you may be left wondering which one to choose.
  - This is not a question with a simple answer
  - There is no single best method
  - Choosing a syntax depends on multiple factors that change from project to project
Some tips for adding structured data to a page
  - If you are going to do it all by hand you will need a syntax that is relatively easy to learn and write
    - Developers may find writing JSON-LD easier, designers may find Microformats better, find the best suited for
      you authoring style
  - Will you be maintaining existing coding standards
    - Microformats for example are class based and will validate well with older versions of HTML, Microdata and RDFa 
      introduce new attributes while JSON-LD abstracts its data away from the content. Ensuring that the chosen syntax
      fits in to your coding practices is critical to the success of the project
  - Goals must be as clear as possible
    - You should identify why you want to add structured data to your pages. If the primary aim is to improve SERP listings
      Microdata which is backed by several of the largest internet compainies eg Google maybe the best choice. On the other
      hand if you need to created and extend your own custom vocabulary RDFa is probably a better choice. If you need to tie
      the Structured Data into CSS style sheets then the class based Microformats makes a better solution.
  - What these all boil down to is that there really is no best syntax, you will need to properly research the one which
    best suits your needs, you may even need to mix multiple syntaxes to achieve your goals
The course will cover working with each of these syntaxes.



                    Section 3 - Marking Up Contacts
1 - Microformats And hCard
This is one of the oldes syntaxes available
  - http://microformats.org
The course is project based and will involve taking an existing site and adding structured data to it.
  - The exercises folder has the files for the example site
  - Because this is more for machines there is not going to be much phsical difference between the site as viewed 
    before and after changes are applied.

2 - Structuring Contact Data
Before adding Structured Data you should review a page to assess the difficulty
  - In this example the focus will be on the contact info in the sample application
  - The page being assessed is the profile.htm page
  - Most syntaxes are tied into HTML so it is import to understand the existing structure
  - The profile.html can be open in a code editor
  - If you are familiar with HTML using Microformats is a matter of getting up to speed on class names
  - In most syntaxes you have to identify the type of element being represented
    - In the example it is h-card which covers the persons contact info
  - If you start with clean well structured semantic HTML it reduces the effort needed to implement Structured Data

3 - Adding Names And Titles
The way that the Microformats syntax works is that you declare an object type first
  - This is done using the class attribute
  - You can then apply properties to individual elements
  - Structured Data is not that concerned with appropriate order of items but that they are labelled properly 
Example Syntax
  // Reusing the profile.htm file
  <article role="article" class="main-col h-card">
    // The p-name property is added here because the first occurence of the name is in its own property  
    <h3 class="p-name">Angela Haston</h3>

      Sports active apparel. After being with the company for a year, she was promoted to Director of Sales. Angela is 
      the drive behind the H+ Sport ACTIVE product line and has an uncanny ability to formulate strategies that have helped 
      build our unified sales force. Educating people about health and nutrition is something that Angela holds dear, and 
      she's excited to play a role in transforming lives.</p>
    <p>She recently founded the KidFit Seattle program, which seeks to encourage kids and their parents to play active games
      and participate in outdoor activities at least three times a week. KidFit Seattle now has clubs in over 150 area 
      schools, and the program is planning on expanding to other cities next year. We&rsquo;re proud to have Angela on our

4 - Formatting Phone And Email
To add structured data for phone numbers you will need
  - p-tel
  - u-email
  - Don't assume the the preceeding letter will always be a P, in the email u is used and is for url
