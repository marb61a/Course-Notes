                    Section 2 - Introducing Structured Data 
1 - What Is Structured Data
HTML is often referred to as the foundation of the web
It is the core language of every site and has a large set of tags for describing web page structure
  - This is limited though to describing document structure and specific UI elements
  - This means that there aren't tags which define common content types
HTML is designed with a smaller set of elements deliberately as
  - It is easier to learn
  - It can be easier to parse
  - Easier implementation across multiple user agents
  - It does created problems for Search Engines etc to understand site content
Structured Data is a loose term that covers a number of vocabularies and syntaxes
  - These can be combined with HTMl to provide a much richer level detail on content description
There are benefits to using Structured Data 
  - Increases accuracy of site indexing by search engines
  - Improves the accuracy of search results
  - Adds an additional layer of semantics to content
  - It will make data more meaningful to machines reading site code
  - It is not used everywhere on a page
  - Convention is to use it to highlight certain pieces of information such as 
    - The highlight or subject of the page
    - An important piece of content that needs to be indexed accurately

2 - Popular Syntaxes
There are different syntaxes available for use on a website
There are differences between vocabularies and syntaxes when used in Structured Data
Vocabularies
  - Are used to describe and categorize content
Syntaxes
  - Are used to integrate vocabularies into HTML
In some cases vocabularies and syntaxes are independent of each other
  - Good Relations is a vocabulary that describes goods and services
  - http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/
  - This can be implemented using which syntax you prefer
Even when they are tied together using items such as hCard
  - http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard
  - Most will offer a way to implement most vocabularies using their syntax
Microformats
  - This was one of the first structured data solutions
  - It was designed to extend the semantic meaning of HTML
  - It is well supported by search engines
  - It has given rise to standards such a hCard and hCalender
  - A large community continues to extend and create vocabularies
RDFa
  - RDFa is an acronym standing for Resource Description Framework & Attributes
  - This is a W3C standard
  - It adds a set of attributes to HTML for embedding Structure Data to pages
  - It was orignally tied to the development of XHTML
  - It works with almost all markup languages including HTML
  - It is well supported by search engines
  - There are 2 different types of RDFa
    - RDFa & RDFa Lite which is a smaller subset of RDFa and is easier to use
Microdata
  - This is a part of the WHATWG HTML5 specification
  - It works around embedding metadata that helps define existing page content
  - It uses structured attributes that create name value pairs that identify content
  - It is well supported by search engines
  - It was adopted by Google, Bing, Yahoo & Yandex as their preferred Structured data syntax
JSON-LD
  - It stands for Java Script Object Notation for Linked Data
  - It takes a different approaches to Structured Data to the previous syntaxes
  - It uses JSON to store structured data in embedded scripts
  - This abstracts the data from the document structure
  - This is also a W3C specification
  - It is not fully supported by search engines yet
Schema.org
  - It is not a Structured Data syntax
  - It is an initiative by Google, Bing, Yahoo & Yandex to standardize vocabularies
  - It enjoys a high level of adoption for sites
  - It favours Microdata but can be used with most syntaxes
