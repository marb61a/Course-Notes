                    Section 2 - Introducing Structured Data 
1 - What Is Structured Data
HTML is often referred to as the foundation of the web
It is the core language of every site and has a large set of tags for describing web page structure
  - This is limited though to describing document structure and specific UI elements
  - This means that there aren't tags which define common content types
HTML is designed with a smaller set of elements deliberately as
  - It is easier to learn
  - It can be easier to parse
  - Easier implementation across multiple user agents
  - It does created problems for Search Engines etc to understand site content
Structured Data is a loose term that covers a number of vocabularies and syntaxes
  - These can be combined with HTMl to provide a much richer level detail on content description
There are benefits to using Structured Data 
  - Increases accuracy of site indexing by search engines
  - Improves the accuracy of search results
  - Adds an additional layer of semantics to content
  - It will make data more meaningful to machines reading site code
  - It is not used everywhere on a page
  - Convention is to use it to highlight certain pieces of information such as 
    - The highlight or subject of the page
    - An important piece of content that needs to be indexed accurately
