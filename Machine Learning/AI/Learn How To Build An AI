                    Artificial Intelligence A-Z : Learn How To Build An AI
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Welcome to the course!
A brief welcome to the course from the instructors
Why AI
  - Moores Law has meant that computer power has reached the point where AI is possible
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law
  - Some of the priciples that AI use in games can be used in business
    - AI was able to reduce Google's data center electricity bill by 40%
There are also materials available for download
This course will use PyTorch
  - Some of the resources use Tensorflow but are well worth looking at



                    Section 2  - Fundamentals Of Reinforcement Learning
1 - Q-Learning Intuition
Reinforcement Learning is a process 
  - The example of training a dog is used eg giving a treat as a reward
    - These rewards are + or - minus 1 etc in AI
  - The course uses the example of a maze
    - An environment does not have to be a maze, it can be anything in life
    - Making breakfast is a routine that has actions and state changes
  - Each time the agent takes an action there is a state change and sometimes a reward
    - Actions should be taken at the appropriate time
  - Preprogrammed functions are the opposite of reinforcement learning
    - In preprogrammed robot dogs walking automatically are already in memory
    - This is different in robot dogs not preprogrammed, moving forward etc will get +1 and falling -1 for example
    - This will eventually be learned by the robot dogs and they may be better than reinforcement versions

The Bellman Equation
  - This can be complex and will be introduces gradually
