                    Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks
                    Course Notes

                    Section 1 - Welcome to the course
Introduction to the instructors and the course
  - How to install the necessary tools
    - Anaconda -- https://www.anaconda.com/download/
    - Spyder IDE is used
      - When launched the Anaconda navigator can be closed
      - There are some panels that need to be opened
        - IPython console
        - Editor
        - Variable Explorer
        - Object Inspector
  - How to get the dataset necessary for the course


                    Section 2 - Artificial Neural Networks
1 - ANN Intuition
There is a small discussion of neuroscience
  - This covers the neuron and how the human brain works

Neuron
  - https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron
A lot of the purpose of Deep Learning is mimicing the human brain and how it works
  - The question is how to recreate it in a machine
  - This is because of how powerful a learning machine the brain is
The Neuron was drawn by
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram√≥n_y_Cajal
  - Neurons by themselves are not that useful
  - Millions of neurons by themselves connected can build powerful systems
  - They do not phyiscally touch
  - Where the signal passes from one neuron to the other is called a Synapse
  - They have input signals/values and an output value
    - The input layer in a brain is touch, smell etc
    - They are all independent variables of one single observation
      - They need to be standardised
    

The Activation Function
  - There are many different types of Activation function
  - The course will be concentrating on 4 functions
    - Threshold Functions
