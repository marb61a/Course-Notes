                    Section 2 - Artificial Neural Networks
1 - ANN Intuition
There is a small discussion of neuroscience
  - This covers the neuron and how the human brain works

Neuron
  - https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron
A lot of the purpose of Deep Learning is mimicing the human brain and how it works
  - The question is how to recreate it in a machine
  - This is because of how powerful a learning machine the brain is
The Neuron was drawn by
