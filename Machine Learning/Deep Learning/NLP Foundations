1 - Intro to Natural Language Processing
A brief welcome to the course
  - Language is a huge part of Human life
  - Some reckon it is a huge part of intelligence and comprehension

Computers can have a difficult time understanding human languages
  - This can be because of a lack of exactly defined structure
  - This is either a drawback or feature depending on your point of view
  - Mathematics is an example of a more structured language
    - This is because there is no ambiguity
  - Formal Logic is another example of a more structured approach to language

Structured Languages are easier to parse for computers
  - This is because of a precise set of rules or grammar
  - The course uses a Backus-Naur Form example
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_form
  - Problems with these rules are called syntax errors
