Advice on optimizing the GitHub profile
  - To attract the attention of recruiters and senior software engineers ensure the following
    - Account has at least three projects
    - The account shows knowledge about how to make incremental commits
    - The commit graph shows many green squares for the last two weeks
      - This shows that commits have been pushed regularly
    - Your GitHub username is professional
    - The profile picture is a professional image
    - Profile includes at least one up-to-date links for: 'URL' and/or 'Company' fields and/or ‘Contact Email’
    - The profile should include current location
    - Projects should have meaningful names
      - These projects should be forked appropriately
    - Projects should have meaningful descriptions
    - The most recent three projects have a completed README
      - These could contain an image of the deployed app if applicable
