                    Object Detection and Recognition Using Deep Learning in OpenCV 
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - BASIC OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS IN OPENCV
1 - The Course Overview
Brief intro to the author and a run through of the course curriculum
The target audience for the course is
  - Beginners who are new to computer vision and are looking for a pracitical perspective
  - It offers a birds eye view for engineers with a focus on coding
The are some ideal prerequisites
  - Basic image processing theory
  - Python programming

2 - How to Work with Images in OpenCV?
A quick run through of what the section will cover
An image is
  - A 2d array of numbers
  - Each pixel corresponds to a pixel value
  - Image resolution gives the number of pixels
Images in OpenCV
  - Are loaded as unsigned 8 bit integers
  - Colour images have 3 channels (R, G, B)
  - Each channel is a single greyscale image
The Matrix class in OpenCV
  - It is the most fundamental class in OpenCV
  - It stores image data
  - It contains functions for image manipulation
  - It is not as explicit using Python as it is in C\C++
Visual Studio Code will be used as the text editor
