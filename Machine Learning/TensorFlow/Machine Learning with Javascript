                    Machine Learning with Javascript
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - What is Machine Learning?
Introduction to the course and the intructor
There is a quick example using example flood data for a city
The problem solving process that will be used throughout the course is
  - Identify the data that is relevant to the problem
  - Assemble a dataset related to the problem
  - Decide on the output predictions type
  - Based on the output type pick and algorithm that will determine a correlation between faetures and labels
  - Use the model generated by the algorithm to make a prediction

2 types of output that may try to be predicted
  - There are others available but these will be the focus of the course
    - Each of these has their own pros and cons
  - Classification which is where the value of labels belong to a discrete set
    - Is an email spam or not
  - Regression which is where the value of labels belong to a continuous set
    - An example is a car of a particular type and year has a value from one to another eg $0 -> $50,000
  - Nearly all datasets will have to be cleaned and formatted
  - Features are categories of data points that affect the value of a data point
  - Models relate the value of features to the value of labels

There is a github repo available for cloning
  - This is the first problem for assess in the course


                    Section 2 - Algorithm Overview
KNN
  - K-Nearest Neighbor

Lodash
  - This is a JavaScript utility library
  - https://lodash.com
  - https://github.com/lodash/lodash/
