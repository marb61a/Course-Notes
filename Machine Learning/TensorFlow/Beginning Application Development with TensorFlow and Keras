1 - Course Overview
A quick overview of what the course will cover and an introduction to the instructoe

2 - Setting up your Environment
The course uses a couple of tools
  - Visual Studio code
  - The Python extension for VSCode
    - This can be installed through the extensions
    - There may also be a need to install PyLint
There is also a quick guide to installing VS Code
  - The instructor uses MacOS but VSCode is available

4 - What are Neural Networks and Deep Learning?
Neural Networks
  - They are also known as Artificial Neural Networks
  - They were first proposed in the 1940s
  - They proposed to create a computer system that works like a Human brain
  - It works like an interconnected network
Deep Learning is largely the contemporary study of Neural Networks
  - Deep Learning Neural Networks are typically far greater in size
  - They have many more nodes and layers
  - Deeo Learning networks algorithms and apps require many resources to achieve success
DL systems have been used in many large scale industry applications
