                    Machine Learning with Javascript
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - What is Machine Learning?
Introduction to the course and the intructor
There is a quick example using example flood data for a city
The problem solving process that will be used throughout the course is
  - Identify the data that is relevant to the problem
  - Assemble a dataset related to the problem
  - Decide on the output predictions type
  - Based on the output type pick and algorithm that will determine a correlation between faetures and labels
  - Use the model generated by the algorithm to make a prediction
