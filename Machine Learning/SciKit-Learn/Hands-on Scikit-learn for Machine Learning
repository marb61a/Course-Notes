                    Hands-on Scikit-learn for Machine Learning
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - GETTING STARTED WITH A SIMPLE ML MODEL IN SCIKIT-LEARN
1 - The Course Overview
Introduction to the course instructor
  - There is also a run through of the course curriculum
There are some prerequisites for students taking the course
  - Intermediate level Python knowledge
  - Some familiarity with Pandas and NumPy libraries
  - Basic familiarity with ML terms
The course is very practical and hands on
  - There will be a lot of line by line walkthroughs
  - There will also be a lot od code explanations
  - By the end a student should feel very comfortable enough with ML to go deeper
  - There will not be deep mathematical or theoretical aspects of models and algorithms

2 - Course Objectives, Software Installation, and Setup
What is Scikit-learn
  - It is a Python library for Machine Learning
  - It is used by 1000's around the world
  - It is Open Source and free to use
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn

There are 2 different approaches to learning 
  - From the bottom up
    - 1st learn functions available in the library
    - 2nd learn how to use them to build modules
    - 3rd is to learn to use the modules in a solution
  - From the top down
    -
