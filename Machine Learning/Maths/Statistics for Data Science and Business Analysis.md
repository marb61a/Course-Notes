                    Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
Students are advised to take lessons in order
  - They should not skip as one lesson builds on another
  - There are downloadable materials and quizzes which should be completed 



                    Section 2 - Sample or population data?
The first step when doing a statistical analysis is findout whether data is a sample or a population
  - A population is regarded as the collection of all items of interest to our study
    - It is usually denoted by an uppercase N
    - The numbers obtained using a population are called parameters
  - A sample is a subset of the population
    - It is denoted with a lowercase n
    - The numbers obtained using a sample are called statistics
Populations are very hard to define and observe in real life
  - eg Trying to find the entire student body of a university is very unlikely
  - This is because some maybe abroad, on exchange, distance learning etc
Samples should be both random and representative
  - The safest way could be to select randomly from the entire population eg database list
  - Sampling properly becomes easier with experience which reduces cost
  - Statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data



                    Section 3 - The fundamentals of descriptive statistics
Different types of variables require different types of tests
  - It is important to be able to classify the data being worked with
Data can be classified in 2 main ways
  - Type
    - Categorical which describes categories or groups
    - Numerical describes numbers which are then subdivided into 2 sub-categories
      - Discrete can be counted in a finite manner eg Number of houses on a road
      - Continuous is opposite to discrete and is infinite in manner eg A person's weight which can fluctuate
  - Measurement level
    - This can be split into 2 sub-types
      - Qualitative
        - Qualitative data can be 2 types
          - Nominal
            - These are similar to categories eg Ford cars
            - There are no numbers so ordering of data is not available
          - Ordinal
            - This is similar to nominal but there is a strict ordering involved
      - Quantitative
        - Quantitative data is also split into 2 types
          - Interval
            - Represented by numbers
            - Temperature using Celsius or Farenheit
            - 0 F or C means nothing as the absolute negative temperature can be -273 C
            - In this example difference between 2 values is important
          - Ratio
            - Again represented by numbers but has a true zero 0
            - Example 0 cm means there is no length
            - Some numbers can be both depending on context
  
  Graphs and Tables
  
    - These allow for visually representing the data being worked with
    - Visualising data is the most intuitive way to interpret it
    
  Categorical Variables are usually represented by
    - Frequency distribution tables
      - This has 2 columns in the example
        - The category and the frequency

  - Bar Charts
    - These are much more intuitive than frequency distribution tables
    - The frequency is on the vertical axis and the category on the horizontal
    - This then shows a bar chart

    - Pie Charts
    - Pareto Diagrams
