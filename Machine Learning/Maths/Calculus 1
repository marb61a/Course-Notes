                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Calculus 1 - Introduction & Resources
A brief welcome to the course
  - There is a cheatsheet available containing needed formulae
  - The course can be taken in order or whatever topics the students need help on
  - Taking notes and reading instructor notes is recommended
  - Answering the quizzes is also recommended for the best learning experience



                    Section 2 - Foundations of Calculus - Functions
In this section Functions are the only equations of interest
  - An equation is 2 equivalent expressions connected by an equals sign
  - Functions are a particular type of equation
    - It tells us about the relationship between x and y
    - It will give only 1 y for each x that is put into it
    - You put 1 value in then you get one value out
    - It can help to think of a function machine
      - 1 side has an input the other an output
      - The machine is the equatiion that relates x and y
      - Each pair of inputs and outputs can be a point on the graph of the function
      - The graph is a visual representation of all the input output pairs
  Equation                    Function
  y = 3x + 1                  f(x) = 3x + 1
  (x, y) co-oridnates         (x, f(x))

The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values
  - Depending on the function some values will be impossible to input
  - One example will be that the square root of a negative number cannot be found




                    Section 3 - Foundations of Calculus - Graphing functions
*** If you do not know what your graph should look like then you can start off by plotting points
  - There are different tricks available as different functions will need different sketches
Equation Modeling
  // Solving a story problem
  // In an equation modeling problem there is normally a wordy description of the equation to write
  // In this pick out the relevant pieces is a skill that needs to be learned
