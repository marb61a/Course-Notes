                    Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
Students are advised to take lessons in order
  - They should not skip as one lesson builds on another
  - There are downloadable materials and quizzes which should be completed 



                    Section 2 - Sample or population data?
The first step when doing a statistical analysis is findout whether data is a sample or a population
  - A population is regarded as the collection of all items of interest to our study
    - It is usually denoted by an uppercase N
    - The numbers obtained using a population are called parameters
  - A sample is a subset of the population
    - It is denoted with a lowercase n
    - The numbers obtained using a sample are called statistics
Populations are very hard to define and observe in real life
  - eg Trying to find the entire student body of a university is very unlikely
  - This is because some maybe abroad, on exchange, distance learning etc
Samples should be both random and representative
  - The safest way could be to select randomly from the entire population eg database list
  - Sampling properly becomes easier with experience which reduces cost
  - Statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data



                    Section 3 - The fundamentals of descriptive statistics
Different types of variables require different types of tests
  - It is important to be able to classify the data being worked with
Data can be classified in 2 main ways
  - Type
    - Categorical which describes categories or groups
    - Numerical describes numbers which are then subdivided into 2 sub-categories
      - Discrete can be counted in a finite manner eg Number of houses on a road
      - Continuous is opposite to discrete and is infinite in manner eg A person's weight which can fluctuate
  - Measurement level


                    Section 4 - Measures of central tendency, asymmetry, and variability


                    Section 5 - Practical example: descriptive statistics


                    Section 6 - Distributions


                    Section 7 - Estimators and estimates


                    Section 8 - Confidence intervals: advanced topics


                    Section 9 - Practical example: inferential statistics


                    Section 10 - Hypothesis testing: Introduction


                    Section 11 - Hypothesis testing: Let's start testing!


                    Section 12 - Practical example: hypothesis testing


                    Section 13 - The fundamentals of regression analysis


                    Section 14 - Subtleties of regression analysis


                    Section 15 - Assumptions for linear regression analysis


                    Section 17 - Dealing with categorical data


                    Section 18 - Practical example: regression analysis
