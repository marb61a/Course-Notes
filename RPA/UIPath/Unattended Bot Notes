                    Chapter 15 - UpWork Freelancing Project
Scenario - Freelancing Project for Loan eligibility
Users cannot follow along due to system access being unavailable
The client has a cumbersome manual process which involves resetting an interest rate and needs to be replaced by an automated process.
The course creator has also provided a lecture showing howto apply for projects on Upwork
  - This includes interaction with potential clients
  - Build trust with a client by using video when communication
  - There maybe a need to use third party cloud service such as AWS
    - There is a need to check hardware requirements for UIPath
    - https://docs.uipath.com/installation-and-upgrade/docs/studio-hardware-and-software-requirements
    - There are 2 type, minimum requirements or recommended requirements
  - https://www.loandisk.com/ -- Loan Management system
  - PEM files are RSA private keys, more infor available at
    - https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/what-is-a-pem-file-and-how-do-you-use-it/
  - The course instructor provides a couple of videos on configuring AWS remote desktop
    - There are many videos available for doing this or configuring for different providers.

Analysing Project Requirements
  - Start by ensuring full familiarity with information that the client has provided
    - Make sure that the client has not omitted things like login details etc
    - Do not assume that the client wants you to do things, always find out
  - Some processes have similar named sub-processes so ensure the you are clear on these
    - Automating the wrong sub-process will mean that the project will need to be reengineered
    - If possible try exploring the system that is being automated as a user
  - Standard practice is to use dummy data for testing purposes
    - This should be as similar as possible to the real world data that the client would use
  - Don't assume that you will have full access to a system eg creating new dummy accounts
  - Conditions that are needed for a bot are more important than some details
    - Some things will trigger a robot to behave differently and will need to be understood more than irrelevant information
  - Ensure that formats are correctly noted eg Dates as incorrect formats can cause issues

Brainstorm Bot Architecture
  - The architecture of a bot will be influenced by how the process works
    - As said above, explore and become familiar with the process as much as possible
  - Each system will have little vagaries so they need to be familiar
  - Ensure that you have all features needed installed
  - In the case study there needs to be a thorough study of factors that affect loan eligibility.
