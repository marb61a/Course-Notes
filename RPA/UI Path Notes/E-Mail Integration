Start a new Project
  - First start by registering with the future rpa site
    - https://project.futurerpa.com/
    - Site itself is built using the Bubble environment
    - Ensure that zoom is set to 100% to avoid responsiveness issues which may occur
    - Add all proper details as project comes with certificate so incorrect details will affect this
  - Start off by selecting New Process after starting up UIPath Studio
  - The purpose of the project is to show how the student would create an enterprise grade robot
  - Place the excel file in the same directory as the project file to avoid path issues
    - This is not best practice but robot design is the purpose of the course not file paths!!
