                    UIPath -> Enterprise Data Migration Bot
                    Project From the CompleteRPABootcamp

Resources will be in this folder

Start a new Project
  - First start by registering with the future rpa site
    - https://project.futurerpa.com/
    - Site itself is built using the Bubble environment
    - Ensure that zoom is set to 100% to avoid responsiveness issues which may occur
    - Add all proper details as project comes with certificate so incorrect details will affect this
  - Start off by selecting New Process after starting up UIPath Studio
  - The purpose of the project is to show how the student would create an enterprise grade robot
  - Place the excel file in the same directory as the project file to avoid path issues
    - This is not best practice but robot design is the purpose of the course not file paths!!

Variable & Argument Notation
  - The customers data file is a .xlsx file which is a workbook in UIPath
  - Make sure that the activities tab is selected at the bottom of the activities panel
  - Then search for workbook and drag in Read Range
  - When the Read Range is bought in, it will be wrapped in a sequence which can be renamed to Main
    - This is a best practice as all activities should be renamed to fit into the project and are easily readable
    - Names should not be too long, spacing an capitalising the first letter of each word is a good idea but not compulsory
    - There is no standard scheme but having the first word being an action word eg Read will allow others to understand what is going on
  - To import the workbook simply click the folder icon on the activity and that will open a popup window
    - In some editions of UIPath this will be 3 dots
  - After import ensure that the correct sheet is named and the cell range to be used is stated
    - If not wanting to state a specific value simply leave 2 empty quotations
    - This reads all the data cells from a sheet in Excel
  - Then ouput a datatable which is in the properties panel
    - In the Output cell hit ctrl+k to set a variable, in this case CustomerData which is done using Pascal case
    - This should then appear in the variables panel (click variables tab)

Custom For Each Row
  - Looping through the customers in the excel file
  - There are 2 different options available, For Each Row and For Each
    - For Each Row is used to loop through each row in a data table
    - In the latest edition of UIPath (Aug 2021) For Each Row has been renamed to For Each Row in Data Table !!!
  - Use the CustomerData variable as the value for in and change value to row in ForEach
    - Again rename the For Each Row, this time to Process Each Customer
  - Then add a Write Line to the Body cell
    - We can select row and then choose .Item() and choose a column or columns.
    - There will be an error due to needing to convert from object to string so add .ToString method
  - After this then click Run
    - It is the play button or underneath debug file dropwown
    - The ouput can then be seen in the output panel which can be seen by clicking the output tab
