Example Syntax

2 - Create A Practical Example Of Closures
Closures are a very common concept in Javascript
  - You are probably using them even if you do not know it
  - Closures make very good interview questions
Example Syntax
  function setupItem(){
    var myNumber = 1;
    
    function increment(){
      return console.log(myNumber++)
    }
    
    increment();
  }
  
  setupItem();
  
Closures are also common inside object definitions
Example Syntax
  // An example of a closure inside an object definition which will help remember state
  function myObject(){
    var myValue = 1;
    
    return {
      display: function(){
        return console.log(myValue);
      },
      increment: function(){
        return myValue++;
      }
    };
  }
  
  var mything = myObject();
      mything.display();
      mything.increment();
      mything.display();
