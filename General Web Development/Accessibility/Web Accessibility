                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
Introduction to the course
  - Accessibility is for everyone
  - It is a moving target
A quick run through of the syllabus that the course will cover
  - There are similarities to the web performance field
  - Internationalisation is also similar
  - The main idea is to get as many people able to use a website
  - The main forcus of the course will be on helping people with disabilities can use the web
On a more specific level Web Accessibility means that people with disabilities can 
  - Perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the web
  - Also and equally important is that they can contribute to the web
There is a run through of some USA oriented statistics on disabilities
The web already is accessible even though your site may not be
Developers should care about accessibility for several reasons
  - Human Rights, Legal Issues, Reaching a larger audience and developers maybe responsible for inaccessibility
The WebAim Organisation has a checklist for developers   
  - They provide resources for developers to help with accessiblity
  - https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist
  - All sites should be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust (POUR)


                    Section 2 - Types of Disabilities
1 - Types of Disability
There are different tpes of disabilites to take into account when designing a site
  - Attention-Defecit Hyper-Activity disorders
  - Blindness or Low Vision
  - Brain Injuries
  - Deaf\Hard of Hearing
  - Learning Disabilities
  - Physical Disabilities
  - Speech and Language Disabilities

2 - How to browse the web
There are many different ways to browse the web
  - Keyboard only as certain disabilities cause issues with using a mouse
  - Head Wand and Mouthsticks for certain disabilities
  - Single Switch
  - Screen Readers



                    Section 3 - Keyboard Navigation
1 - Keyboard Shortcuts
On top of having the site navigable by keyboard are keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts can make navigating a site much quicker and easier
The example used is from Twitter for keyboard shortcuts
  - https://twitter.com/perform/status/350980645872345088?lang=en
Most social media sites have the types of shortcuts
  - Most also follow the vim standard setup

2 - Tabbable Elements
On any website there should be tabble elements setup
  - Tab goes forward 1 item
  - Shift + Tab goes back an item
There is a list of items which should be tabbable on your site
  - <a>, <button>, <input>, <select>, <textarea>, <iframe>
Not every element should be tabbable as it would then cause problems getting to a desired element
  - Presentation items eg <div> should not be tabbable
Example Syntax
  // HTML tabindex which can be used to make items which would not be tabbable into tabbable items
  <div tabindex="0">I'm Focusable</div>
 Tabindex has 3 possible values that it can take
  - A negative value which the element should be focusable but not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation
    - You would us Javascript in the development to reach the element
  - 0 means should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation but relative order determined by platform
  - A positive value should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, relative order determined by
    - The value of the attribute sequentially following the increasing number of the tabindex
    - If several elements share the same tab index then relative order follows relaive position in the document
