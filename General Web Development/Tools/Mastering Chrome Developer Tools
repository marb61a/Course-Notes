                    Mastering Chrome Developer Tools
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - History of Developer Tools
Quick introduction to the instructor
Chrome dev-tools will change regularly but the design is broadly the same
A discussion of the pre-dev-tools times
  - Firebug which is a firefox add-on was out slightly ahead of Chrome
  - Firefox has its own tools set which is nearly as powerful 
Getting experience with the tools can help with other areas of development
  - Each of the main JS frameworks have add ons which can be installed in dev-tools

                    Section 2 - Editing
1 - Elements Panel & Style Editor
The course will cover 3 main areas, Editing, Debugging, Profiling
Some keyboard shortcuts for using Developer Tools are available at
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts
In the Elements Tab
  - You can see different elements of the DOM
  - The sub-tab structure opens on stypes by default
  - You can double-click on items to edit them
    - You can also right-click on the element and select -> Edit as html 
  - On the style sub-tab on the right-hand side of the page
    - You can click the + icon to add additional style rules
    - You can also click :hov to simulate hovering behaviour
      - This allows for much better interaction with a site during debugging
  - For Single Page Apps there is a right-click scroll into view
    - This avoids having a large amount of scrolling
  - The computed sub-tab is for when there maybe a large number of style sheets
    - There is a graphical view of how the styles are applied
    - There is also a list of the actual styles that have been applied to the page
