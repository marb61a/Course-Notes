                    Mastering Chrome Developer Tools
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - History of Developer Tools
Quick introduction to the instructor
Chrome dev-tools will change regularly but the design is broadly the same
A discussion of the pre-dev-tools times
  - Firebug which is a firefox add-on was out slightly ahead of Chrome
  - Firefox has its own tools set which is nearly as powerful 
Getting experience with the tools can help with other areas of development
  - Each of the main JS frameworks have add ons which can be installed in dev-tools

2 - Things Dev Tools Can Do
You can use DevTools to do many different things
  - Create files
  - Write Code
  - Persist changes to disk
  - Step through debug
  - Audit Pages for performance
  - Emulate Devices
  - Simulate network conditions
  - Find memory leaks
  - Profile the source code
  - Analyze JS performance
  - Spot page jank eg page paint
Dev tools documentation is located at
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/
Keyboard shortcuts are available at
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts
Chrome Canary will be used in the course
  - This is a bleeding edge version of Chrome
  - https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html
  - This is not available for Linux systems

3 - Developer Tools Panels



                    Section 2 - Editing
1 - Elements Panel & Style Editor
The course will cover 3 main areas, Editing, Debugging, Profiling
Some keyboard shortcuts for using Developer Tools are available at
  - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts
In the Elements Tab
  - You can see different elements of the DOM
  - The sub-tab structure opens on stypes by default
  - You can double-click on items to edit them
    - You can also right-click on the element and select -> Edit as html 
  - On the style sub-tab on the right-hand side of the page
    - You can click the + icon to add additional style rules
    - You can also click :hov to simulate hovering behaviour
      - This allows for much better interaction with a site during debugging
  - For Single Page Apps there is a right-click scroll into view
    - This avoids having a large amount of scrolling
  - The computed sub-tab is for when there maybe a large number of style sheets
    - There is a graphical view of how the styles are applied
    - There is also a list of the actual styles that have been applied to the page

2 - DOM Break Points, Color Formats, & Code Specificity

3 - Sources Panel & Workspaces

4 - Challenge 1: Editing a Page

5 - Challenge 1 Solution



                    Section 3 - Debugging
1 - Step-Through Debugging
The course moves into the debugging phase at this point
Step-through Debugging is a concept which is in a lot of different languages
  - This was not available in JS for a long time
  - This gives more control than simple placing of console.log statements in the application
Using the debugging tab
  - You can use cmd/ctrl + p to open a file

2 - Black-Boxing and the Debugger API
When looking at call stacks it is going to be very common especially in production code
  - To see a bunch of libraries you are using which is not your code in the call stack
  - The bug you are looking for is probably in you code rather than these libraries
  - You can use black boxing of scripts to stop them cluttering up the tabs
    - You can right click and select blackbox script
    - These will then be greyed out
    - Also you wont step into them when step through debugging
  - You should blackbox things like JQuery
    - This blackboxing will persist
  - You can use the debugger in a file
    - This can help when apps crash on starting
    - This is almost an API for debugging

4 - Variable Scope

5 - Challenge 2 Solution

6 - Conditional & XHR Breakpoints



                    Section 4 - Profiling
1 - Audits Panel
The starting point is why is Profiling important
  - Things like why is loading time important
  - Wordpress has tools like W3Total Cache
    - Extensive notes on Wordpress performance are available at
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Business/Wordpress/WPFaster

2 - Common Audit Problems
Inline CSS will be audited for unused CSS rules
  - If it is on the element however it is definitely used
Page-load time should probably be thought of all the time 
  - A lot of different factors will affect this
Common Audit Problems
  - Combine external CSS & JS
  - Enable gzip compression
  - Compress images
  - Leverage browser caching
  - Put CSS in the document head
  - Unused CSS rules
    - These are old CSS rules that can be pruned
