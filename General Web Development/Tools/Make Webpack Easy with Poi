                    Make Webpack Easy with Poi
                    Course Notes
                   
                   
1 - Use Poi to Build an Index.js with Modern JavaScript Features
Use npm to install Poi, the install should be global
  - npm install -g poi
Example Syntax
  // In a project create an index.js file
  // Poi creates a div with the id of app
  // To run the file, type poi at the terminal which will open http://localhost:4000 by default
  // Poi handles all Webpack stuff eg to install RxJS just use npm i rxjs
  import { Observable } from "rxjs";
  
  // This increments each second
  Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(
    i => (
      (document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = `
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        // The dollar sign is for string interpolation using template string syntax
        <h2>${i}</h2>
     `)
    )
