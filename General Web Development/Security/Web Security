                    Web Security 
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section - 1 
Web Development has a huge security problem
  - Web Developers have fallen behind DevOps and Back End developers
Features & Deadlines are always in competition with security
  - This is true also of Techical Debt
  - The main reason is the business value or perceived value to the business
Attacks are escalating in their severity and impact
  - This is compounded by the fact that barriers to attack launch are lower than ever
There is a sample app provided that the course will use for launching practice attacks on
  - There are some incomplete features which expand the list of available attack vectors
  - This can happen in real life with future feature flags left in which arent working yet
There course will make use of both viewpoints 
  - The student will be launching attacks on the app
  - After the attacks then there will be how to shore up the defences
    - This will hopefully get to the stage of negating many of the attacks
The app will use cookie based authentication
  - It will be tested using IE9
  - This is because of the need for different data points
    - Modern browsers which negate some attacks automatically and older ones which don't but are still in use

There are 3 main types of hackers
  - Black Hat
    - These break into systems to cause damage or hold data for ransom and are usually drive by personal gain
  - Grey Hat
    - These types break into systems but cause no damage and are usually driven by curiosity
  - White Hat
    - These types of hackers break into systems with perission and report what they find
    - They also use a process called responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities they find to give time for fixes

The M.O. of an attacker
  - Use various methods to gather information about your system
  - Research any vulnerabilities which may exist
  - Get an initial foothold in the system
  - Use the foothold to escalate to more serious attacks
The Agenda of the course will cover
  - Multiple attacks on the client
  - Cross Site Scripting (xss)
  - 3rd party assets eg npm dependencies
  - Cross Site Request Forgeries (CSRF)
  - Clickjacking Attcks which are also called UI redress attacks
  - CDN resource tampering
  - Https downgrade attacks
  - Man In The Middle Attacks

Client Side Attacks
  - The first client side attack to be discussed is also the most prevalent XSS
