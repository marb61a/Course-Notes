2 - About This Course
A quick run through of the syllabus of the course 
  - The course is designed get the student up and running with using Change Streams

3 - About This module
A brief run through of this module
  - Before using change streams it should be understood why they are a good idea

4 - The Architecture Need
A look at what streams will do for us
  - This is done with an example shop and the evolution of the Information systems needed
  - Simplicity tends to evolve in to multiple components which need to work well together
  - Having multiple systems touching the same db can be problematic
  - Each system may touch tables etc that they should not
  - As the systems grow so does the pressure on the db
  - Sometimes having a db per application will be the best solution
  - Having these communicate with each other can be troublesome
  - Even with a specially designed API this will still result in spaghetti code

5 - Separate Messaging Infrastructure
Continuing the previous example
  - There will be a seperate massaging infrastructure put in place
  - We do not want the exiting API's to directly communicate with each other
  - Instead each system will publish data other systems might need to the messaging layer
  - If a system needs something then they will subscribe to the appropriate messaging service
