                    Notes from GoRails Screencasts
                    
1 - Environment Variables
Environment variables are variables created by an OS that can be used by different applications
Some include
  - $PATH - this shows paths to files
  - $EMAIL_ADDRESS - shows user email address
There are multiple different environment variables available
ruby -v shows ruby version
By setting a key and then using the irb shell with ENV["key"] will show the kay value
Storing passwords and keys in environment variables is used in a lot of ruby apps rather than in the application
Using the export command sets the variable for the session
.bashrc is the file on linux for setting environment variables that last


2 - Ruby Version Managers
Multiple ways to setup and install Ruby
RVM - Ruby Version Manager, full feature version manager
RBEnv - Lightweight ruby version manager (for more advanced users)


3 - Rails Application Structure
rails new "app name" will create a new file
ru - Rackup file, rack is a tool to run a webserver
config.ru - contains environmental variables
boot.rb - sets up gemfile, effectively boots the application
application.rb - contains places to set global variables
environments - folder which contains the different possibles environments, test, production and development
database.yml - contain db config information
routes.rb - define app urls
secrets.yml - contains secret keys(in development dont use in production)


4 - The Params Hash
Collection of data that has come through your data
It can come from several sources
rails s - Runs rails app
Query Parameters - extra information on the end of a url
Rails takes these parameters, they are what is in the params hash
If you have params in your controller it will access the parameters
Useful if you want to use filters
This uses  GET requests
Using :id in a url will save information into the id key
UTF -8 & Authenticity Token automatically added by Rails
