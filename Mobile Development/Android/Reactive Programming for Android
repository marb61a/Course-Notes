                    Reactive Programming for Android 
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - BUILDING OUR FIRST RXJAVA APPLICATION
1 - The Course Overview
A quick intro to the course and author
Writing code on Android can be difficult
  - Writing high quality code that handles concurrent and paralell tasks is even harder
  - Ensuring that there are no unforseen race conditions is hugely difficult
  - RxJava can help write this code
  - The course will teach novice developers how to produce this code
The course uses Android Studio 2.3.3

2 - Dependencies
This is where the Core and UI dependencies are added
Start a new project in Android Studio
  - The project name and location can be anything
  - Ensure that it is set for phones and tablets and an empty activity

3 - The Very First User Interface

4 - Using Retrolambda
