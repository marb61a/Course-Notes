                    HTTP2 Fundamentals - Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
Introduction to the syllabus and to the author
Overview of the history of web pages
Nielsons law of bandwith
  - This states that there will be a 50% increase in bandwidth each year
  - This is somewhat similar to Moores Law which states that technology will double every 18 months
Approximately 3 billion people use the internet

2 - Why the need for HTTP2
Stuart Cheshire in 1996 in a paper said latency was going to be the biggest issue facing the internet users in the future
Page Size
  - Parges larger in size
  - Much of the material is not primary content
Latency is limited by the speed of light
  - It could be 80 - 200 ms
Latency is money
  - Increasing bandwidth means page load times drop proportionately but at a point the impact is greately reduced
Latency greatly affects user behaviour
Some rich media web pages can have 400 requests

3 - TCP The underlying Problem
Everything runs on the transport layer of the OSI model
  - Mostly using TCP
More Notes on TCP &  related is available at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Networking
Headers were not introduced to HTTP1.0
In HTTP1.1 There was a connection field introduced to the header
  - This defaulted to keep-alive
The reliability of TCP instead of UDP because of its connection oriented approach has many good features but this
reliability also can cause problems
Head Of Line Blocking
  - This is where a line of packets is held up because the first packet has either been lost or dropped and is preventing 
  further processing of packets
  - This is a big issue when using HTTP piplining which will be covered later in the course
The waterfall pattern is from under performing websites where the page loading statistics look like a waterfall
Another issue of TCP is flow control which deals with congestion problems, basically it adjusts transfer rate based
on network reactions.
TCP SLow Start
  - This is where a connection is started with a small transfer rate called a window size and is increased until maximum 
  capacity is then found, if affects every TCP connection

4 - HTTP2
HTTP2 is a binary protocol which itself makes things easier as it is easier to pass binary instead of text
HTTP2 uses the same semantics as HTTP1.x
HTTP2 addresses the shortcomings of TCP
SPDY was a protocol developed by Google to address performance issues 
SPDY constitutes the foundation of HTTP2 and it has replaced SPDY
Development work on SPDY has been discontinued
Chrome has dropped support for SPDY
HTTPBis Working Group is the main group charged with working on HTTP2
HTTP2 RFC Number is 7540
`- There is a corresponding RFC 7541 (HPACK) which covers header compression
HTTP2 is supported by most browsers & server software

5 - Demo HTTP2 In Action
A quick demonstration of using HTTP2 using akamamai

6 - Summary
Quick summary of the material covered in the section


                    Section 2 - An HTTP2 Connection
1 - Establishing An HTTP2 Connection
In HTTP1.x the client makes a request to the server
  - It does this using plain text
  - This sends a verb, a resource url and some header information
The server in turn responds with the corresponding resource or error code
Each request and response is self contained
In HTTP2 things change a bit
  - The exchange is no longer in plain text but in binary
  - The binary messages contain the same information
HTTP2 is not compatible with HTTP1.x
  - It does however need to work on the existing infrastructure of the web
HTTP2 needs to work on top of HTTP1.x, there are 2 options for doing this
  - Plain Text
    - Client issues a request with the header upgrade h2c
    - If the server supports HTTP2 it sends back a 101(Switching Protocols) response
  - TLS
    - The predominant methodology as it is used with ssl
    - There had to be an extension called Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) added
      - ALPN allows protocol negotiationto take place during the handshake

2 - Frames And Messages
Frames constitute the basic protocol unit in HTTP2
They are used for communicating data whether its header or a response body
There are 10 different types of frames in the HTTP2 protocol, each having a different function
Each frame will contain a series of header fields which will be 72 bytes in size in total
The header will be followed by the payload which will vary depending of the frame type
Some important fields are
  - Type -- This indicates the type of frame being used
  - Flags -- These are associated with Type and indicate specific characteristics for that frame
  - ID -- This indicates the stream that the frame is associated with
  - Payload -- This is the actual content, which will vary depending on type

HTTP2 Messages
These are used because HTTP2 needs to keep the semantics of HTTP1.X
A message consists of a series of frames
A HTTP2 Request Message consists of a series of Header frames and Data frames
  - The response message is similar in structure
The data frame is by far the most important frame as it carries the payload of the request and response bodies
Padding in used in the data frame to mitigate against attacks

Headers Frame
The headers frame corresponds to headers sent in a request and response
There can be many headers and they can be distributed over multiple frames
A series of flags such as endheaders and endstream are used to indicate if the headers frame is the last
or followed by a series of continuation frames which contain additional header information
There is a single headers frame and one or more continuation frames
A few fields E, Stream Dependency and Weight are related to stream priorities

Every HTTP2 connection has a series of settings that apply through out the exchanges
These settings are defined with the settings frame and are sent when establishing a connection
The parameters include
  - SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE
  - SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH
  - SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS
  - SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE
  - SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE
  - SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE

3 - Headers
Headers in HTTP2 are similar to headers in HTTP1.X
They are key-value pairs with a possibility of multiple values per key
Field names are still strings and are case insensitive
  - It is required to have all in lowercase before encoding  
HTTP2 has Pseudo-Header fields which are specific fields which provide information on 
  - Scheme -- :scheme is the scheme of the URI
  - URL
  - Method -- This indicates the verb use eg GET
  - Response Status -- :status is used in the response and is the status code
  - Authority -- :authority indicates authority information about the URI
  - Path -- :path indicates the actual path of the URI
These fields are pre-fixed with a colon
The Pseudo Header fields must also appear prior to other header fields in a request and response
HTTP2 takes header treatment a step further than HTTP1.X
HTTP1.X is very wasteful as it retransmits information that had not changed
HTTP2 seeks to address this waste by using compression
  - This compression is known as HPack
    - This is used to compress headers
    - This compression uses Huffman encoding along with 2 tables
      - Static and Dynamic which maintain a list of headers
      - The Dynamic table is initially empty and its maximum size is set by the settings frame
      - The Static table has a list of known and frequently used headers
      - The combination of the tables form the Index Address Space
  - Initiallly Zlib was used for the compression
    - This was removed due to the CRIME attack 
      - More information is available at -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME
Instead of sending either header names and values HPack uses indexes to look up the corresppnding name-values
This means the with a HTTP2 there is state being maintained for these headers

4 - Basic Tooling
Author recommends tools for using during the course
  - curl
    - This uses nghttp2 behind the scenes
  - Wireshark
    - Protocol Analyser
    - Industry standard
    - Wireshark supports SSL decryption
      - You need to export the sslkeylog file to a specific file and configure Wireshark to use this file
  - Chrome Browser
    - The network tab in the developers tools shows the protocol being used
    - Chrome also provides the ability to see the live HTTP2 session
      - In the url bar type chrome://net-internals/#http2
      - You can then select a session

5 - Demo An HTTP 2 Connection
Demonstration of the tools listed above
The nghhtp2.org site is the site being used in the example
  - curl -vs -o /dev/null --http2 http://nghttp2.org
  - Initial connection will be using HTTP1.x
  - At that point then the connection is upgraded to using HTTP2
The easiest way to ensure Wireshark uses the keylogfile and the browser exports to it is to set an environmental variable
  // This command may differ on each platform
  // You may need to create the file
  - export SSLKEYLOGFILE =#/tools/ssl/sslkeylog.log
To ensure that environment variable is applied in the righ context launch the browser and wireshark from the same terminal
To avoid going through all traffic apply the http2 filter in Wireshark

Brief summary of the material covered in the chapter



                    Section 3 - Streams
1 - A Recap On HTTP 1.1 v HTTP2
A quick recap of the differences netween the two versions of the HTTP protocol

2 - Multiplexing And Streams
With HTTP2 there is only one connection per host
Multiplexing is a technique where multiple signals are combined into a single signal
  - The reverse operation is called demultiplexing
  - Both multiplexing and demultiplexing is very common at the transport layer
HTTP2 bring an approach similar to multiplexing
With HTTP2 on a single connection there can be multiple streams
Each stream is identified by an integer eg stream5
A stream is nothing more than a set of frames being exchanged between client and server
Streams initiated from client to server use odd numbers and the opposite uses even numbers
A stream with an id of 0 is used for connection control messages
Streams bring
  - Parallel requests and responses
    - This means faster response times
  - SETTINGS defines the maximum concurrency
    - This setting is specific to each endpoint
    - This is applicable only to the peer that receives the setting
Streams have state, this stream varies
  - What the actual frame is
  - What flags are set
  - Some states include 
    - IDLE, OPEN, RESERVED, HALF-CLOSED
    - When an endpoint is in the open state it can send or receive frames of any type
    - If a frame with the end stream flag set the state transitions to half-closed
    -  This can be remote or local
    - When closed it can only recieve frames of certain types eg Priority
Unless implementing the HTTP2 specification then you won't need to know the behind the scenes stuff

3 - Demo An HTTP2 Stream Exchange
Demo using the HTTP2 Gopher tiles example site
  - This example uses multiple small images to create a large image
  - Stream will once again be analysed in Wireshark
  - There is no sequence of stream id eg Stream 50 is not necessarily followed by Stream 51
  - Chrome limits open connections in HTTP1.x to 6
    - Using the HTTP1.x example will again show the waterfall effect

4 - Stream Priorities
Having multiple interleaved stream going back and forth necessitates that there be some sort of prioritisation
HTTP 2 has the ability to define the priority of a stream
Clients can use prioritisation for how they wish to receive responses
Servers can use to prioritise stream processing
  - Example is that some applications will give priority to certain content types
To give priority
  - A stream is given a weight which is an integer from 1 - 256
  - The lower the number the higher the priority
  - Streams are not isolated and one may depend on another
  - In addition to weight streams will also have a dependency property
  - Streams with no dependencies will have the dependency_id set to 0
  - Dependencies are not linear and can form trees
  
5 - Demo Priorities In Action
Demo using
  - nghttp2
  - Priorities will be based on content type
  - Example using a small application with different content types eg css etc
  - You will need to install nghttp2
    - It can be run using nghttpd command with different options
  - You will need a certificate
    - A self signed cert for testing purposes
  - You need to setup docs folder
    - If you wish to use port 442 you will need root privileges
  - Using chrome net-internals to show priorities
  
6 - Flow Control
If one stream fails it could have the consequence of blocking all other streams
  - This is the same problem which affected HTTP1.x
To solve this issue HTTP2 introduces flow control which is similar to flow control at the transport level
Recievers can increase or decrease window size from the default 64kb size
  - This adjusting the window size is whats known as flow control
  - It allows for control of saturation on the receiver side in case it cannot handle data coming in
Flow control in HTTP2 is available at 2 levels
  - Connection and Stream levels
  - This operates hop to hop rather than end to end as there can be intermediaries
Window Size can be changed
  - Using SETTINGS frame before communication takes place
  - Using WINDOW_UPDATE frame during communication
  - It only affects data frames
  - There is no standard implementation in the specification

                    Section 4 - Server Push
1 - Introduction
Introduction to the section
Server Push allows communitation to be pushed by the server
Standard practice has a client asking a server for resources and anytime anthing else is wanted a further request is made
This has an effect as there are separate requests needed for each resource which impacts performance
There are different schemes available for trying to improve performance
  - Inlining which means including the actual Javascript content, CSS styles in the html pages
    - This is not practical as it prevents reuse of code and prevents caching
    - This is not the best of options

2 - Server Push
Server Push is an option available in HTTP2
The server will push resources to the client without the need for a client request
The way the Server Push works is
  - The client sends a request to a server
  - The server responds by sending a PUSH_PROMISE frame
    - This is sent on the same stream as the original request
    - This contains a Header Block Fragment which contains request header fields
There are certain requirements that must be met for the server to push down data
  - It should be safe in the context of not having any effect on the resource itself
  - It should be cacheable so that the client may cache it
  - There is no request body included
  - If the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH is set to 0 the server should not try and push
If the client does not wish to receive data it can send a RST_STREAM frame
  - There are 2 different error codes available
    - Use cancel on the reset stream if not wanting to receive cached data
    - Refuse stream is used when it has not even begun to process and is refusing the stream
Server Push has several practical usages
  - Pushing referenced resources
  - Cache Invalidation
Push is a fantastic technology but does not replace
  - Websockets
  - It could however be combined with server sent events

3 - Demo Server Push In Action
A quick demonstration on Server Push in action
  - The example again uses nghttp2 server for demonstration

                    Section 5 - Security, Proxies And More
1 - TLS, SSL And HTTP2
Introduction to what the section will cover
HTTP2 does not require security it can work over either plain text or SSL/TLS
  - This is because of disagreements over cypher algorithms
  - Most browser vendors will not support HTTP2 over plaintext
  - Aside from adding security there may be additional overhead
SSL\TLS are frequently used interchangebly
  - They are technically different
  - SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, TLS for Transport Layer Security
  - TLS is the successor to SSL3 and is built on SSL
  - People are usually referring to HTTPS when discussing this
TLS provides 3 main things
  - Encryption, Authentication and Integrity
TLS adds to the overhead from TCP 3 way handshake
  - The TLS handshake uses Asssymetric Encryption
  - ALPN which stands for Application Layer Protocol Negotiation was added to save on overhead
    - There is nothing to stop this from being used with other protocols

2 - TLS Overhead
Independently of anything the world is already moving to HTTPS
  - All social media sites for example are using HTTPS
  - ALPN has made performance impact minimal
  - It is important to remember the the assymetric encryption is only used for the key exchange
The other costs of TLS
  - Certificate cost and administrative costs
    - Let's encrypt is a free site for certificates, its site is available at
    - It has also automated away many admin costs
      - https://letsencrypt.org

3 - Caches And Proxies
There are questions about using HTTP2 and how it interacts with
  - Proxies\Reverse Proxies
  - Caches

4 - Other Important HTTP2 Frames
PING Frames - These are use to check if a connection is still alive
GOAWAY Frame - Used to either gracefully shut down a connection or indicate that there has been a serious error
