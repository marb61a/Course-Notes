                    HTTP2 Fundamentals - Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
Introduction to the syllabus and to the author
Overview of the history of web pages
Nielsons law of bandwith
  - This states that there will be a 50% increase in bandwidth each year
  - This is somewhat similar to Moores Law which states that technology will double every 18 months
Approximately 3 billion people use the internet

2 - Why the need for HTTP2
Stuart Cheshire in 1996 in a paper said latency was going to be the biggest issue facing the internet users in the future
Page Size
  - Parges larger in size
  - Much of the material is not primary content
Latency is limited by the speed of light
  - It could be 80 - 200 ms
Latency is money
  - Increasing bandwidth means page load times drop proportionately but at a point the impact is greately reduced
Latency greatly affects user behaviour
Some rich media web pages can have 400 requests

3 - TCP The underlying Problem
Everything runs on the transport layer of the OSI model
  - Mostly using TCP
More Notes on TCP &  related is available at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Networking
Headers were not introduced to HTTP1.0
In HTTP1.1 There was a connection field introduced to the header
  - This defaulted to keep-alive
The reliability of TCP instead of UDP because of its connection oriented approach has many good features but this
reliability also can cause problems
Head Of Line Blocking
  - This is where a line of packets is held up because the first packet has either been lost or dropped and is preventing 
  further processing of packets
  - This is a big issue when using HTTP piplining which will be covered later in the course
The waterfall pattern is from under performing websites where the page loading statistics look like a waterfall
Another issue of TCP is flow control which deals with congestion problems, basically it adjusts transfer rate based
on network reactions.
TCP SLow Start
  - This is where a connection is started with a small transfer rate called a window size and is increased until maximum 
  capacity is then found, if affects every TCP connection

4 - HTTP2
HTTP2 is a binary protocol which itself makes things easier as it is easier to pass binary instead of text
HTTP2 uses the same semantics as HTTP1.x
HTTP2 addresses the shortcomings of TCP
SPDY was a protocol developed by Google to address performance issues 
SPDY constitutes the foundation of HTTP2 and it has replaced SPDY
Development work on SPDY has been discontinued
Chrome has dropped support for SPDY
HTTPBis Working Group is the main group charged with working on HTTP2
HTTP2 RFC Number is 7540
`- There is a corresponding RFC 7541 (HPACK) which covers header compression
HTTP2 is supported by most browsers & server software
