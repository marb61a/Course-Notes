1 - Introduction
Introduction to the syllabus and to the author
Overview of the history of web pages
Nielsons law of bandwith
  - This states that there will be a 50% increase in bandwidth each year
  - This is somewhat similar to Moores Law which states that technology will double every 18 months
Approximately 3 billion people use the internet

2 - Why the need for HTTP2
Stuart Cheshire in 1996 in a paper said latency was going to be the biggest issue facing the internet users in the future
Page Size
  - Parges larger in size
  - Much of the material is not primary content
Latency is limited by the speed of light
  - It could be 80 - 200 ms
Latency is money
  - Increasing bandwidth means page load times drop proportionately but at a point the impact is greately reduced
Latency greatly affects user behaviour
Some rich media web pages can have 400 requests
