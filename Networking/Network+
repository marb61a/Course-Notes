                    Course 01 - Network Theory
OSI - Open Systems Interconnect
Has 7 layers
  - Application -- High-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access
  - Presentation -- Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, 
                    data compression and encryption/decryption
  - Session -- Managing communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth 
               transmissions between two nodes
  - Transport -- Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement 
                 and multiplexing
  - Network -- Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control
  - Data Link -- Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer
  - Physical -- Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium

                    Course 03 - Unbounded Network Media
                    
                    
                    Course 04 - Network Implementations 
                    
                    
                    Course 05 - TCP/IP Addressing and Data Delivery 
                    
                    
                    Course 06 - Routing 
Routes
  - Are paths used by data packets to reach specified destination.
  - They are added to the Routing Table
  - Connected networks directly attached to router interface
    - They are gateways for hosts on different networks
  - Remote networks are
    - Manually configured on the router
    - Set automatically using dynamic routing protocols

                    
                    Course 07 - TCP/IP Services
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
  - Connection-oriented protocol.
  - Guaranteed delivery.
  - Part of the Internet protocol suite.
  - Breaks data into segments then reassembles at the receiver end.
  - Resends any data lost in transit.
  - Resequences data.
  - Sends data, waits for acknowledgement, resubmits, if necessary.

Transmission of data on IP networks
  - Sender transmits PDU and waits for an ACK signal.
  - Throughput increased if data is sent as larger PDUs.
  - PDUs at Layer 4 are Segments for TCP and Datagrams for UDP.

IP addresses have different configuaration utilities for different platforms
  - ipconfig -- Windows utility
  - ifconfig -- *nix utility
  - dhclient -- *nix utility

                    Course 14 - Network Management
The term Acceptable Use in network management 
  - Defines how computer and network resources can be used
  - Protects information and limits liabilities and legal actions
  - Addresses productivity issues
  - Employees should properly and fully read and sign document detailing organisational acceptable use policy
  
Due Care is another legal term which means the
  - Judgment or care exercised in a given circumstance
  - It also identifies risks to organization
  - Assesses those risks and the subsequent measures to be taken to ensure information security

Privacy is a concern of parties covering suppliers and customers and their data such as
  - Contracts
  – Sales documents
  – Financial data
  – Personally identifiable information

A best practice and often legal mandate is the separation of duties which
  - Avoids one person having all knowledge of a process which has potential for abuse and if the person leaves then
    valuanle knowledge leaves with that person
  - Distribute tasks
  - Document all procedures
  - Security divided into multiple elements with ach element assigned to different people

Operations should be ran on a need to know basis
  - Sensitive information accessed only by those who must
  - Give IT team just enough permissions to perform duties
  - Give explicit access to those who need it
