  - 802.11n
  - Channels
    - 802.11g and b use 2.4–2.5 GHz with 11 channels 5 MHz apart
    - Most routers default to channel 6
    - Closely located wireless networks using the same or adjacent channels can interfere with one another
    - Can change the default channel on the wireless AP to decrease interference
      – Apply to both AP and its clients
802.1x Standard

  - It requires 3 roles in an authentication process
    - Device requesting access
    - Authenticator
    - Authentication Server
  - It allows multiple authentication algorithms to be used
  - It is an Open Standard
Channel Bonding
  - This allows devices to use two adjacent channels at once
  - It doubles bandwidth
  - There is a primary or control channel
  - There is also an extension or secondary channel
  - It works at both 2.4 or 2.5 GHz frequencies
  - It works best at 5Ghz with 802.11n or 802.1n standards

  - If a WAP is password-protected, devices can see it but not connect to it.

Multiple In Multiple Out (MIMO)
  - Uses multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver
  - Increases throughput and range
  - It is available in 802.11n and 802.11g

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
  - Connection-oriented protocol.
  - Guaranteed delivery.
  - Part of the Internet protocol suite.
  - Breaks data into segments then reassembles at the receiver end.
  - Resends any data lost in transit.
  - Resequences data.
  - Sends data, waits for acknowledgement, resubmits, if necessary.

Transmission of data on IP networks
  - Sender transmits PDU and waits for an ACK signal.
  - Throughput increased if data is sent as larger PDUs.
  - PDUs at Layer 4 are Segments for TCP and Datagrams for UDP.

IP addresses have different configuaration utilities for different platforms
  - ipconfig -- Windows utility
  - ifconfig -- *nix utility
  - dhclient -- *nix utility

2 Major Types Packet Switching & Circuit Switching
  - Packet Switching
    - Data is grouped into packets before being sent over a shared network
    - Packets can contain multiple types of data
    - Packets can be buffered and queued
    - Thay can result in tranmission delays
    - Examples of technology are Ethernet and LAN
  - Circuit Switching
    - A dedicated path for transmission between two nodes
    - The transfer moves at a non-stop rate
    - The path is unavailable for other traffic until its released
    - The technology examples are PTSN and ISDN

Virtual Network Interface Cards (NIC's)
  - Software that emulates a physical NIC.
  - VMs use them to communicate with other VMs on the same host.
  - Assigned a unique MAC address.
  - Additional configuration required to communicate with VMs or devices on the physical network.

Virtual Switches
  - Communicate with other VMs on the same host
  - Communicate with VMs and hosts on the physical LAN

                    Course 10 - Network Security Basics 
Wireless Network Seurity involves
  - Access Control
  - Encryption
  - Authentication
  - Isolation
Encryption Standard used include
  - Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original
    802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired 
    network
  - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) 
    - WPA-Personal, this mode is appropriate for most home networks
    - WPA Enterprise  gives each PC a unique encryption key, which the user never sees, so they can't share it
    - WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is an upgrade from the original WPA technology
    - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication,
      Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service
    - EAP/LEAP/PEAP

                    Course 14 - Network Management
The term Acceptable Use in network management 
  - Defines how computer and network resources can be used
  - Protects information and limits liabilities and legal actions
  - Addresses productivity issues
  - Employees should properly and fully read and sign document detailing organisational acceptable use policy
  
Due Care is another legal term which means the
  - Judgment or care exercised in a given circumstance
  - It also identifies risks to organization
  - Assesses those risks and the subsequent measures to be taken to ensure information security

Privacy is a concern of parties covering suppliers and customers and their data such as
  - Contracts
  – Sales documents
  – Financial data
  – Personally identifiable information

A best practice and often legal mandate is the separation of duties which
  - Avoids one person having all knowledge of a process which has potential for abuse and if the person leaves then
    valuanle knowledge leaves with that person
  - Distribute tasks
  - Document all procedures
  - Security divided into multiple elements with ach element assigned to different people

Operations should be ran on a need to know basis
  - Sensitive information accessed only by those who must
  - Give IT team just enough permissions to perform duties
  - Give explicit access to those who need it
