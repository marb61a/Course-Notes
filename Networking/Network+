                    Course 05 - TCP/IP Addressing and Data Delivery 
Network Communications Protocols
  - They establish the rules and formats that are followed for communication between networks and nodes
  - They also format data into packets
  - Media access method sends packets
TCP -- Transmission Control Protocol
  - It is the standard protocol used to transmit information across the internet
  - Some of the features that TCP provides are
    - Acknowledged connection-orientated communications
    - Guaranteed delivery
    - Proper sequencing
    - Data Integrity checks
TCP operates via a 3 way handshake, more information is available here
  - http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPConnectionEstablishmentProcessTheThreeWayHandsh-3.htm

IP -- Internet Protocol
  - It is an unreliable connectionless protocol
  - It functions at the Network layer of the OSI model
  - It's sole function is to transmit TCP\UDP and other higher level protocol packets
  - It is responsible for logical addressing of each outgoing packet
  - It also verifies that incoming packets are addressed to the computer
  - It must have a Transport layer service to work with

UDP -- User Datagram Protocol
  - It is used in connectionless, unacknowledged communications
  - It Simply sends information
  - It is not as commonly used as TCP
  - Operates at the Transport layer of the OSI model
  - Using IP, it adds information about source and destination socket identifiers
  - It is commonly used for streaming audio and video

Encapsulation on TCP\IP based networks
  - Data is sent from the Application layer to the transport layer
  - The Transport layer adds a header to the datagram and moves the datagram to the Internet layer
  - The Internet layer adds another header and then passes the datagram to the Network layer.
  - The Network layer then adds a header and trailer.
  - The entire packet with header and trailer is sent.
  - On receipt, headers and trailers are removed from the data and it moves to Application layer.


                    
                    Course 06 - Routing 
Routes
  - Are paths used by data packets to reach specified destination.

    - Manually configured on the router
    - Set automatically using dynamic routing protocols

                    
                    Course 07 - TCP/IP Services
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
  - Connection-oriented protocol.
  - Guaranteed delivery.
  - Part of the Internet protocol suite.
  - Breaks data into segments then reassembles at the receiver end.
  - Resends any data lost in transit.
  - Resequences data.
  - Sends data, waits for acknowledgement, resubmits, if necessary.

Transmission of data on IP networks
  - Sender transmits PDU and waits for an ACK signal.
  - Throughput increased if data is sent as larger PDUs.
  - PDUs at Layer 4 are Segments for TCP and Datagrams for UDP.

IP addresses have different configuaration utilities for different platforms
  - ipconfig -- Windows utility
  - ifconfig -- *nix utility
  - dhclient -- *nix utility

2 Major Types Packet Switching & Circuit Switching
  - Packet Switching
    - Data is grouped into packets before being sent over a shared network
    - Packets can contain multiple types of data
    - Packets can be buffered and queued
    - Thay can result in tranmission delays
    - Examples of technology are Ethernet and LAN
  - Circuit Switching
    - A dedicated path for transmission between two nodes
    - The transfer moves at a non-stop rate
    - The path is unavailable for other traffic until its released
    - The technology examples are PTSN and ISDN

Encryption Standard used include
  - Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original
    802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired 
    network
  - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) 
    - WPA-Personal, this mode is appropriate for most home networks
    - WPA Enterprise  gives each PC a unique encryption key, which the user never sees, so they can't share it
    - WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is an upgrade from the original WPA technology
    - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication,
      Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service
    - EAP/LEAP/PEAP

Due Care is another legal term which means the
  - Judgment or care exercised in a given circumstance

  - Assesses those risks and the subsequent measures to be taken to ensure information security

Privacy is a concern of parties covering suppliers and customers and their data such as
  - Contracts
  – Sales documents
  – Financial data
  – Personally identifiable information

A best practice and often legal mandate is the separation of duties which
  - Avoids one person having all knowledge of a process which has potential for abuse and if the person leaves then
    valuanle knowledge leaves with that person
  - Distribute tasks
  - Document all procedures
  - Security divided into multiple elements with ach element assigned to different people

Operations should be ran on a need to know basis
  - Sensitive information accessed only by those who must
  - Give IT team just enough permissions to perform duties
  - Give explicit access to those who need it
