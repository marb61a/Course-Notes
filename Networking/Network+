                    Course 01 - Network Theory
OSI - Open Systems Interconnect
Has 7 layers
  - Application -- High-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access
  - Presentation -- Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, 
                    data compression and encryption/decryption
  - Session -- Managing communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth 
               transmissions between two nodes
  - Transport -- Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement 
                 and multiplexing
  - Network -- Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control
  - Data Link -- Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer
  - Physical -- Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium
