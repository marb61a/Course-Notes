                    Course 01 - Network Theory
OSI - Open Systems Interconnect
Has 7 layers
  - Application -- High-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access
  - Presentation -- Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, 
                    data compression and encryption/decryption
  - Session -- Managing communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth 
               transmissions between two nodes
  - Transport -- Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement 
                 and multiplexing
  - Network -- Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control
  - Data Link -- Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer

                    Course 02 - Bounded Network Media
                    
                    
                    Course 03 - Unbounded Network Media
                    
                    
                    Course 04 - Network Implementations 
Repeaters are hardware devices 
  - They boost signal from one segment to another
  - There are 2 types available
    - Amplifier
    – Signal-regenerating
There are wireless versions available
Repeaters operate
  - OSI Layer 1 -- Physical Layer
  - They amplify signal
  - They also amplify noise
  - You are limited in the number of repeaters per segment
  - Intelligent repeaters regenerate signal and are immune to attenuation
Repeaters have any limitations including
  - Signal quality
  - Time delays
  - Network traffic
  - Node limitations

Local Area Networks (LAN's)
  - Located within a confined area
  - Connected by wires or radio waves
  - Node: any network device
  - Host: always a computer
  - Can be connected to the Internet
  - Requires host OS

Networks can have different topologies and are defined by physical and logical topologies
  - Logical -- The path that data takes between nodes
  - Physical -- The material layout of network wiring and locations of nodes 

                    
                    Course 05 - TCP/IP Addressing and Data Delivery 
                    
                    
                    Course 06 - Routing 
Routes
  - Are paths used by data packets to reach specified destination.
  - They are added to the Routing Table
  - Connected networks directly attached to router interface
    - They are gateways for hosts on different networks
  - Remote networks are
    - Manually configured on the router
    - Set automatically using dynamic routing protocols

                    
                    Course 07 - TCP/IP Services
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
  - Connection-oriented protocol.
  - Guaranteed delivery.
  - Part of the Internet protocol suite.
  - Breaks data into segments then reassembles at the receiver end.
  - Resends any data lost in transit.
  - Resequences data.
  - Sends data, waits for acknowledgement, resubmits, if necessary.

Transmission of data on IP networks
  - Sender transmits PDU and waits for an ACK signal.
  - Throughput increased if data is sent as larger PDUs.
  - PDUs at Layer 4 are Segments for TCP and Datagrams for UDP.

IP addresses have different configuaration utilities for different platforms
  - ipconfig -- Windows utility
  - ifconfig -- *nix utility
  - dhclient -- *nix utility


                    
                    Course 08 - WAN Infrastructure 
                    
                    
                    Course 09 - Cloud and Virtualization Technologies 
2 Types of server virtualisation
  - Hardware based
    - Hypervisor runs on host hardware
    – “Bare-metal” hypervisors
  - Client based
    - Hypervisor runs on an OS

Virtual Network Interface Cards (NIC's)
  - Software that emulates a physical NIC.
  - VMs use them to communicate with other VMs on the same host.
  - Assigned a unique MAC address.
  - Additional configuration required to communicate with VMs or devices on the physical network.

Virtual Switches
  - Communicate with other VMs on the same host
  - Communicate with VMs and hosts on the physical LAN

Virtual Firewalls are
  - Software-based
  - A Service or appliance running in a virtualised environment
  - Bridge mode
  - Hypervisor mode

Virtual Private Branch Exchange (PBX)
  - Virtual switchboard and private branch exchange
    – VoIP implementation
  - Receive and route calls based on caller’s input
  - Resides on a service provider’s server
    –No investment in physical phone lines, devices, or PBX management software


                    
                    Course 10 - Network Security Basics 

                    
                    
                    Course 11 - Preventing Security Breaches

                    Course 14 - Network Management
The term Acceptable Use in network management 
  - Defines how computer and network resources can be used
  - Protects information and limits liabilities and legal actions
  - Addresses productivity issues
  - Employees should properly and fully read and sign document detailing organisational acceptable use policy
  
Due Care is another legal term which means the
  - Judgment or care exercised in a given circumstance
  - It also identifies risks to organization
  - Assesses those risks and the subsequent measures to be taken to ensure information security

Privacy is a concern of parties covering suppliers and customers and their data such as
  - Contracts
  – Sales documents
  – Financial data
  – Personally identifiable information

A best practice and often legal mandate is the separation of duties which
  - Avoids one person having all knowledge of a process which has potential for abuse and if the person leaves then
    valuanle knowledge leaves with that person
  - Distribute tasks
  - Document all procedures
  - Security divided into multiple elements with ach element assigned to different people

Operations should be ran on a need to know basis
  - Sensitive information accessed only by those who must
  - Give IT team just enough permissions to perform duties
  - Give explicit access to those who need it
