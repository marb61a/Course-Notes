Slides are available to be downloaded for each section but are available here
altogether


2 - Welcome to this course! Let's lay the groundwork for good landing page design
Preview of the course
CRO - Conversion Rate Optimisation
Spending on traffic acquisition was bigger than traffic optimisation by 92%
All landing pages have issues which affect potential customers
Clarity - is the most important element in landing page design
5 second usability test - The most famous of usability tests, cheap and easy to run, the test is run by showing
an image of your landing page with branding removed to people for 5 seconds. They are then asked some questions 
often including
  Who is the company
  What do they sell
  What value do they add to you etc
  

3 - The Myth Of The Perfect Landing Page Conversion Rate
There is no such thing as a perfect conversion rate
Not all site visitors are sales prospects
There is no such thing as an average conversion rate either
Conversion ceiling is well below 100%
3 types of visitors
  No's - Will never convert due to factors like affordability etc
  Yes's - Will always convert due to high level of commitment
  Maybe's - This section of visitors has the highest potential influence


4 - The 3 Main Types of Landing Pages and How To Use Them Effectively
The goal of the marketing campaign will determine what is the correct type of landing page.
Primary Site
  - Contains everything about your business
  - Provides most information
Microsite
  - A modified version of main site
  - Strong emphasis on one type of conversion action
  - Some are used as to uplift businesses
Dedicated Landing Page
  - No navigation
  - Few links
  - Always contains a call to action
  - Has a sense of immediacy
  - Most popular among PPC\SEO campaigns targeting high commercial keywords 
Attention Ratio 
  - Have as few distractions as possible away from primary conversion action
  - ideal ratio is 1 - 1 and dedicated landing page offers that opportunity
  - The closer to 1-1 ratio then the higher conversion rates will be


5 - Common Business Models and Understanding Your Conversion Actions
A conversion is defined as an action that is measurable and has a value
Ecommerce 
          - Most popular conversion is a sale
          - Requires high commitment
          - Average 1-3% average for ecommerce sites
Lead Gen 
          - Usually a service
          - More higher end good
          - Less commitment than ecommerce
          - Longer sales cycle
Publishers\Blogs
          - Make money from ad revenue
          - Give away content
          - Increased prevalence of premium offers
          - Conversion actions include newsletter signup, time on site, click on ads

Desired Conversion Actions 
  - Sales, Subscriptons, Form Fill Rate, Downloads, Advert Revenue

Ad Revenue has decreased over the last few years

Most websites value multiple actions
Every page should have only one primary conversion action
Good design has one conversion in mind


6 - The AIDA Sales Funnel and The Online Decision Making Process
First introduced 1898 Elias StElmo Lewis
The AIDA sales funnel is the foundation of most modern sales teams
All buyers go through 4 cognitive phases
Awareness - Become aware of a need and the existence of a product or service which can meet that need
Interest - Interested in learning about the product or service 
Desire - An active sense of desire for that particular product or service
Action - Where the buyer takes the action

Prospect need different information and treatment in different parts of the funnel
Length of cycle(time take to go through the funnel) can vary greatly
The AIDA funnel is more complex today but still essential

AIDA for websites designed by Andrew Chaa 2002
Browsers = Awareness
Evaluators = Interest
Transactors = Desire
Customers = Action


7 - The Awareness Stage of the Funnel: Where It All Begins
Awareness is a commodity in short supply
Its is vitally important to capture awareness from visitors
People at this stage of the buyer cycle have low levels of commitment to your business and need reassurance and clarity
Permission Marketing - Trades free value in exchange for awareness and engagement
If you are unable to communicate clearly what you offer and how it benefits the customer there will be no interest
Your landing page 
  - Should evoke a sense of calmness
  - Not every element deserves emphasis
  - No gaudy or flashy visuals or colour schemes that are too bold
  - Make things easy to find
Your visitors are not kids in a sweet shop 
  - Too many things to click on create unnecessary distractions
  - Any emphasis on secondary conversion actions detracts from primary conversion actions
  - Supporting copy needs to be relatable and relvant
  - Visual promenence must be given to you primary conversion goal
Too much talking
  - Do not write jargon or hyperbolae, generating awareness is about capturing attention quickly
  - Unclutter your page elements
  - Clear headlines and sub headlines
  - Clearly defined action block


8 - The Interest Stage of the Funnel: Tell Me More
Higher level of commitment than awareness but not that much
Can be accomplished with a fleeting level of attention to one particular element on landing pages
Interest is always self selected
Person based selection
  - Gives visitors a chance to self identify based on their characteristics
  - Gives users clarity and context and helps them make a decision where to click to explore more
Needs based selection
  - Allows users to identify with a particular need that they are looking to meet
  - Increases in interest by offering contextual and relevant information without straining the user
 
Person based selection is usually more effective but depends on the business

The preference usability test
  - Gives users more time to evaluate two different design iterations
  - Give participants specific instructions and context
  - Great test for objective measure of clarity and figuring out which approach works for a specific page


9 - The Desire Stage of the Funnel: I Want What You Sell
Higher level of commercial commitment than the previous stages
Visitors will give you more time and attention
You cannot compel them to act prior to them being ready
Fill in any informational blank spaces
Website visitors transition from passive scanning to active reading during this stage

Trust and Security
  - One of the biggest blocks to conversions is a lack of trust and security
  - Often people are looking for tranactional assurances and social proof
  - Visitors must be allowed to determine the pace and direction of their relationship with a brand
 
Desirable actions -
  - People are still researching the product or service, facilitate with ebooks, white papers etc
  - They are also ofetn still looking at competitors, this is where differentiating yourself is very important
  - Visitors will often look for social proof eg reviews, recommendations even bad reviews are ok
  

10 - The Action Stage of the Funnel: I'm Going to Buy What You Sell
Highest level of commitment
Narural result of passing through previous stages
Products and Services differ at this stage
Products tend to be more towards practical information, services more towards psychological
Don't make people jump through any unnecessary hoops
Remove irrelevant distractions and unecessary words
Avoid any surprises


11 - The Fogg Behavior Model and how it Applies to Good Landing Page Design
Fogg Model - BJ Fogg Stanford University Professor
b = mat Behaviour = Motivation Ability Trigger
These must happen at the same time
Fogg Model has 3 types of motivation
  - Sensation
  - Anticipation
  - Social Cohesion
As you increase simplicty you increase ability and decrease perceived difficulty
3 Different Triggers 
  - Facilitators - Work with high motivation and low perceived difficulty
  - Sparks - Low on motivation high perceived difficulty
  - Signals - Straightforward no lack of motivtion or perceived difficulty
  

12 - Making Your Landing Page Design Memorable
Good design taps into the human lymbic system
Lymbic system responsible for emotion, attention, responses and memories
The lymbic system pursues pleasure and avoids pain as well as controlling spontaneous behaviour
People learn 3 ways
  - Visual 
    - images
    - colours
    - infographics
    - videos
    - tables
  - Audio
    - music
    - voice overs
    - phone calls
  - Kinesthetic
    - quizzes
    - games
    - role playing
People tend towards 1 of the 3 and there is no best way to design pages
Adding elements should not interfere with good design
Especially important during the desire & interest stages



                    Section: 2 - Principles of Good Landing Page Design: Examples, Case Studies & Best Practices
1 - Download all Section Two Slides
Download link for the slides for the section

2 - The Primacy of Product and The Concept of Usability in Landing Page Design
Nothing is more important than having a product or service that people need and want to buy
Consultative vs Commodity
Consultative means not using a supply and demand structure
Services can be either commoditised or consultative in nature, know which type will impact on your approach to marketing
Products are the same but tend to be commodities
Price is normally the number 1 determining factor
Commodities have an extrinsic value determined by the marketplace
Consultative businesses and unique products have an intrinsic value based on both the perceived value of the customer and
the conceived value of the seller
Every page on the site should broadly be able to account for the following factors
  - Useful - Useful information, context, calls to action, does it fill a need
  - Learnable - Can visitors learn to use the site without instruction
  - Memorable - Is it unique in a way that visitors remember as they look at competitors and consider options
  - Effective - Can users actually accomplish what they want to on your site
  - Efficient - Can visitors accomplish their goals with as little effort and mental energy as possible
  - Desirable - Do people actually want it
  - Delightful - Is there an experiential element to the site that excites people about your products or services


3 - Eschew Obfuscation: Clarity and the Quest for Fewer Question Marks
Clarity is of vital importance
Clarity and simplicity = Less thought
Most important when visitor lands on your home page or landing page for the first time
Items should be self evident or failing that self explanatory
Forget about competitors only being a click away, you want ths satisfaction and to avoid any subtle frustration
Some questions to use when assessing site are 
 - Do I know where I am
 - Can I find my way back
 - Can I easily find what I am looking for
 - Can I self select


4 - The 5 Second Usability Test in Landing Page Design (and how you can use it now)
Headers and Subheaders in the context of a 5 second usability test
Website has half a second to form visual impression, you dont have much longer to tell customers about you
3 most important questions (As previous)
You cannot assess your own copy from a users perspective
A lot of sites get headers and subheaders wrong
Headers and Subheaders are the most important factors in 5 second test
Give clarity in the header not the subheader
Avoid overly gimmicky meaningless headlines



5 - The Art and Science Behind Designing High-Converting Calls To Action (CTA's)
Every page should have a CTA
CTA's can be buttons, texts etc
CTA should be very clear and not hunting for it
It should be above the fold if possible
Don't use submit use I want to ..... its much more effective
Whats going to happen next should be clear in the users mind
Action block contains CTA information
Don't ask for unneeded information
Make sure that your buttons stand out as being clickable


6 - Readability and Visual Hierarchy Landing Page Design
Users don't read on the web
Users normally glance and scan particularly early in the funnel
People have been conditioned to scan
User perceives your site more like a billboard than a book
Users will focus on what matches what they are looking for
Create visual hierarchies - inverted pyramid
Use bullet point and highlight key terms
Short paragraphs very short
Dont write in full sentences
Use simple language
Use headlines on every page
Avoid jargon and hyperbolae, be factual
Focus on essential information
Keep it very simple
Important things should be more prominent, use colour, size etc to distinguish it
Use grouping to create structure
Innovation and creation does not need to suffer
Headings should 
 - Give organisation to your page
 - Obvious visual distinction
 - Consistent, headings should have the same level of importance throughout the site
 - Don't float headings


7 - Respecting Web Conventions in Landing Page Design
Respecting conventions is very important
Consistency is on of the most powerful usability principles
The more users expectations prove right the more they will feel in control
Jakobs Law of the Web User Experience - Users spend most of their time on other websites
Only break a convention when absolutely certain that your way of doing things is just as evident
Common conventions
 - Logo in top left corner and leads to home page when clicked
 - Navigation is across the top of the page
 - Secondary navigation along the left hand side (vertical)
 - If E-Commerce shopping cart in the top right hand corner
 - Secondary utilities above navigation bar
 - Any underlined text is a link
 - Any text with a border is a button
 - Flashy rectangles are advertisements
 - Images are not clickable
 - Large text is what you want read first
 - Having site search is very important, either in centre or part of navigation bar
 - On forms have asterisks or the word required to indicate compulsory field
 - Free means free
 - Footer and header are clearly demarcated


8 - Using Videos, Graphics and Imagery to Increase Landing Page Conversion Rates
Use media on a landing page to avoid looking unprofessional
Imagery is the number 1 component that gives visitors a good first impression
Images improve conversion rate when
 - They tell a story
 - They support the product based on conversational understanding
 - They evoke emotions
 - They clarify a confusing concept
 - They are high quality, unique and add a professional look to your site
Images decrease conversion
 - They make text harder to read
 - Its unclear what the image is
 - They are not inline with the brand aesthetic
 - They look like stock pictures
 - There are too many
Image tips
 - Use a solid background container for your text on top of your image
 - Use colour overlay and use opacity to make image look professional
 - Use CSS to flaot text to a position on the image
 - Use gradient overlays
 - Blur the background image
 - Combine techniques to be unique
 - Images can replace text
 - Dont overlook icons and thumbnails
 - Add interest and visual appeal
 - Use alternating columns
 - Don't miss an opportunity to evoke emotion
Video
 - A lot of the same principles as images
 - When done right can have a huge effect on conversion rate
 - Appeals to both audio ans visual learners
 - Don't autoplay, it annoys users
 - Keep it short and simple
 - Make it informative and relevant
 - Be careful with bandwidth and mobile devices
 - Use third party host eg Youtube
 - Embedding in a lightbox usuall works well
 

9 - Information Architecture and Accessibility - Landing Page Design Best Practices
Information Architecture
 - The way your content is organized ...
 - What’s visible above the fold?
 - Where is your navigation and how easy is it to use?
 - Can a person always find their way back to the previous step?
Accessibility
 - How easy your site is to use.
Get your navigation right.
 - If people canʼt find what theyʼre looking for, theyʼll leave.
Visitors should always be one click away from home.
 - Web browsing has no sense of scale, no sense of direction, and no sense of location. 
Good navigation tells users what the site contains how to find it.
 - Use parent categories to group categories and to create an intuitive information architecture.
 
Site Name
 - Near the upper left corner
 - Site ID tells me Iʼm still on the site
 - Frames the entire page
 - Should look like a conventional ID (logo, distinctive visual, tagline)
 - Should click back to homepage

Sections (Primary Navigation)
 - Links to all the main sections of the site.
 - Should be across the top of the page (sometimes fixed)
 - Should be used for grouping
 - “You are here” visual indicator very important
 - On every page (except some key conversion pages)
 
Site Search
 - Appeals to search dominant users
 - “Search” or magnifying glass icon
 - Frame the box!
 - Autocomplete is great
 - Allow for common spelling errors
 
Utilities
 - Links to areas of the site that are not part of the main information architecture.
 - Sign in, register, shopping cart, about us, FAQʼs, sitemap, directory, store locator, jobs, order tracking, discussion forums etc.
 - Should be less visually prominent than other navigational elements.
 - Should be the only things above the logo.
 - Only include the most common utilities at the top - the rest go in the footer nav

Breadcrumbs
 - Easily gives visitors the ability to go back one level or go home
 - Bold or highlight the current level
 - “>” between levels (conventions)
 - The deeper the hierarchy the more useful breadcrumbs are

Page Title
 - On every page, framing the content of that specific page
 - Prominence - should be the largest text on the page
 - Gives visitors a subliminal sense of location

Footer Navigation
 - List of primary page links
 - Contact info
 - Additional site utilities
 - Social icons
 - Newsletter signup
 - Privacy policies
 - Sitemap

Accessibility
Contrast - Make sure you have lots of it.
Feedback - Things that make things happen should have something happen to them when interacted with.
Typography - Typography should go unnoticed 9/10 times. It shouldnʼt be something your visitors think about or even remember.
 - Avoid excessive capitalization
 - Avoid inverse color schemes (dark BG with light text)
 - Avoid multiple text colors
 - Donʼt underline text that isnʼt a link
 - Start with 14pt - increase a few points for an older audience
 - 50-100 character max line length
 

10 - Trust, Safety and Credibility (Part 1) Landing Page Design Best Practices
A users likelihood to convert is directly related to how trustworthy your site feels and appears
Trust and safety is an initial impression formed within a second or two of arriving on your landing page
Because websites lack the fidelity of a face to face relationship, there is a built in anxiety that you’re not trustworthy (guilty until
proven innocent)
Elements that increase trust are subliminal in nature and they’re hard for even users to pinpoint during a usability test
Run real world A/B tests to see improvements in conversion rate
Follow best practices blindly!

Professionalism and Refined Aesthetics
 - We do judge books by their covers
 - This is the hardest thing to get right, itʼs an overall sort of thing
 - Neatness, organization, high level of polish to your site all combine to create a sense of professionalism
 - Clean typography, white space, professional imagery

Transactional Assurances
 - Subtle design elements counteract innate anxiety
 - Equally important for lead generation and ecommerce
 - Needs to be prominent before the conversion action
 - Concerns and subliminal question marks about trust and safety never really go away

Guarantees and Policies
 - Refund policies should not be obscure, unclear or hidden
 - Does the company pay for return shipping?
 - You wonʼt use sell or use my email or phone number for any other purpose
 - Multiple payment methods and options
 - Price match guarantees

Safety Logos
 - If you think they are overrated, think again.
 - These logos are subconsciously expected
 - Relieves anxieties about entering payment methods
 - Include them above the fold and definitely in the checkout process whenever possible.

Clients and Media
 - Your visitors donʼt know you yet.
 - Awards / achievements
 - Media mentions
 - Partnerships
 - Studies and surveys
 - Client lists and logos
 

11 - Trust, Safety and Credibility (Part 2) Landing Page Design Best Practices
Social Identity and Customer Reviews
 - The decisions and tastes of our friends have a strong influence on our own consumer behaviors.
 - Objective numbers indicate leadership in a given space. Powerfully influential.
 - The more you identify with another, the more likely you are to be influenced by them.
 - The key to testimonials effect is to create a sense of identity.
 - If you can convey numbers with social identity then you win social proof.

12 - Dedicated Landing Page Design Best Practices (Part 1)
Landing pages usually have a distinctive style
For PPC and specific marketing dedicated landing pages are crucial
They center around one conversion action
Very important to capture attention immediately
Testing things is much easier
Dont overlook the value of legitimate a email address

Clear Unmistakable Headlines
 - Headlines on landing pages server to capture attention immediately
 - They should be very specific, letting users known that there  is an answer to their questions by continuing with the page
 - Large Font size
 - Should direct the users to action
 - Should be used to increase trust and decrease anxiety
 
Call to Action(CTA)
 - Always have primary CTA or action block above the fold
 - Use tools to check resolution on common sizes
 - Include another CTA below the fold and above the footer
 
Remove Excess Text
 - You have very little time to capture attention
 - Highlight key benefits and features below the main headline
 - Answer your visitors primary questions
 - If you have paragraphs of copy they need to be shorter than main site paragraphs
 - No clutter, No yelling
 
Trust
 - Landing pages have an increase in anxiety
 - Testimonials, Client Logos, Media Mentions and guarantees
 - Trust symbols should be in close proximity to CTA
 
Explainer Videos
 - Work great on landing pages
 - Appeal to less committed visitors
 - The more professional the video the better
 - Treat videos the same as text

Split up long forms
 - Only have key fields on first page
 
Consistent Messaging From The Upstream Click
 - Fulfill promises
 - Offers and promotions should be consistent
 - Message match


13 - Dedicated Landing Page Design Best Practices (Part 2)
Continuation of the previous lesson
 - Do not bait and switch
 
What should you test first(In descending order)
 - Headlines
 - Form fields
 - Offers\Promotions
 - Call to action
 - Images\Videos



                    Section: 3 - Principles of Persuasion in Landing Page Design
1 - Using Scarcity to Improve Conversion Rates on Your Landing Pages
Concepts applicable in everyday life but very effective in marketing
Scarcity 
 - Creates a sense of urgency
 - People would rather make a quick decision than miss out
 - If people think that they can come back anytime they are unlikely to make a decision now
 - This can be applied in any context
 - Can be time or quantity driven
 - Do not overdo it
 
Use deadlines to create urgency
 - Does not have to be a hard deadline
 - Deadlines can be for seasonal products
 - Can be a coupon code for local services
 - Deadlines to register for webinar

Be specific & Be believable
Do not be atypical for your industry
Don't pretend

2 - Principles of Persuasion: Reciprocal Concessions & Reciprocity in Landing Pages
Very prevalent in negotiations
 - Reciprocal concessions are instances where you offer a product or service that’s too expensive (asking for too much) which the
   visitor refuses (you concede). He is more likely to concede to you on the cheaper option.
 - Reciprocity is a feeling of indebtedness caused by even small token gestures or gifts.

Youʼre Less Likely to Say “No” Twice
 - The requester lowers his initial request, making it more likely that the subsequent request is accepted.
 - Under the psychological contract of reciprocity, we should concede to someone else once theyʼve made a concession to us.
 - “Door In The Face Technique”. Your first price or package can be too expensive (almost surely rejected) and the second option will
   be more likely accepted
 - The first option canʼt be too unreasonable, otherwise the rejection of that option wonʼt be seen as a concession.

Reciprocal Concession Ideas
 - Email your prospects list with discounted prices based on previous offers
 - Create a second package with additional features not usually important to the majority of your customers
 - Yes / No Exit-intent popovers
 - Offer a paid signup, then a free trial

Reciprocal Concessions + Anchoring
 - In decision making, an anchor is the first or most prominent option presented
 - People have a tendency to rely heavily on an anchor, evaluating subsequent options within the context of that initial option
 - Commonly used with pricing
 - You can even something you really donʼt intend to ever sell
 - Good use of anchors allows you to convert more users for a higher profit than without the anchor

3 - Principles of Persuasion: Anchoring and Cognitive Dissonance Theory
Engendering Indebtedness
 - People want to return good will, even if it was a small, token gesture
 - By giving gifts or extending yourself to your visitors, you can engender goodwill and a sense or reciprocity
 - Chocolate / waiter study (2002)
 - Donʼt have strings attached, donʼt ask for anything in return
 - Free advice, free tools, trials, content previews, free resources, ebooks and white-papers, consultations, audits and
   additional perks are all gestures that will create a desire to reciprocate

Donʼt Underestimate the value of a Resource Library!

Cognitive Dissonance Theory Works Well With Reciprocity
 - People don't like living in contradictions they want their behaviors (past, current and future) and beliefs to be consistent
 - We will rationalize and behave in ways that will not contradict our previous behavior and efforts
 - You are more likely to be a client of mine than a stranger because of cognitive dissonance theory
 - The more a prospect engages with your website, the more likely they are to be committed to you for your paid services / products

Cognitive dissonance theory can be applied to headlines
Cognitive dissonance should always be applied with positivity making people feel good about themselves

4 - User Scenarios and Contextual Perception in Landing Page Design
EMPATHY
 - Persuasive techniques are only effective if youunderstand your visitors
 - A lot of what you think about your visitors is probably wrong
 - They’re often not the people you think they are
 - They do things differently than you’d think they would
 - They often times have different needs for your products than you think
 
CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS OF YOUR VISITORS
 - In order for you to truly enable your visitors to accomplish their tasks, you need to be aware of who they are.
 - What led them to your site?
 - How much knowledge do they have?
 - What are their anxieties?
 - What are their expectations?

Contextual Awareness: Understanding Your Audience
Who Are They?
 - Demographics, interest groups, affinity audiences. Visitors donʼt have name tags so you need to use aggregate data from analytics
 - Age, gender and ethnicity can have a major impact on your messaging and design aesthetics
 - On site behavior and conversion rate can vary greatly by demographic group

Where did they come from?
 - Different traffic sources bring in visitors in different stages in the funnel 
 - Social media tends to bring in curious, uncommitted, top of the funnel traffic (ads vs organic make a big difference)
 - PPC offers a lot of control and you should have a sense of who these people are
 - Organic offers less control, but your analytics can tell you which keywords youʼre ranking for
 - Email can bring in highly engaged traffic, but you should still have a sense of the demographics of your email lists

User Scenarios
 - Personas are the role of the person (small business owner), but scenarios also take into account the context of their visit.
 - What brought them to the site? What was their underlying concerns or fears? What are their desires and motivations?
 - Itʼs not just task oriented - different people will approach the same task differently.
 
Creating User Scenarios
 - Bring together anyone in the company who comes into contact with prospects (regardless of the stage of the prospect)
 - Each person (or just you) should write a brief description of the person (demographics)
 - Write a detailed role for your target: Who are they? What are their anxieties? How price conscious are they? 
 - Write a detailed intent: What are they trying to accomplish on your site? How do you imagine them accomplishing their desired task? 

Walk In Their Shoes
 - Go back to your landing pages with the user scenarios you and your team put together
 - Look for commonalities and trends (stage in the funnel, age, ethnicity, anxieties, motivations)
 - Assess your information architecture: are you providing the information that eases anxieties or answers questions
 - Close your eyes and imagine YOU are your visitor - what obstacles will you face, what questions will you have?
 - Come up with ways you can lay out the information and design the conversion path in a way that makes more sense to your visitors.
