                    Section 1 - Introduction3 lessons
1 - Welcome
Quick intro to the author and the course

2 - What Are Preprocessors?
SASS is a preprocessor
Preprocessor transforms SASS cose into CSS
SASS is an extension of the original CSS
SASS will save a lot of time writing CSS and you get much more power the standard CSS
There is an extra step as SASS will have to be compiled

You can do more than 1 lesson per day to speed up learning



                    Section 2 - Installing and Using Sass2 lessons
1 - Install Method 1: The Command Line
SASS is written in Ruby
Ruby Installer in Windows
Typing sass -v at command line will check for SASS installation
If no version type gem install sass
SASS files have .scss extension
Compiling SASS using command line is done from within project folder
 -> sass -watch file.scss:file.css

2 - Install Method 2: Dedicated Apps and Services
You can use third party apps to build SASS
https://prepros.io - Windows tool
https://codepen.io - Browser based tool for learning Front End development


                    Section 3 - Week 1
1 - Day 1: Syntax
2 Syntaxes - SCSS & SASS
.sass & .scss file extensions
SCSS is an extension of traditional standard CSS
You can write traditoional CSS is the file
SASS uses indentation rather than brackets
Properties separated by new lines in SASS rather than semi-colons in SCSS and traitional CCS
Comments in SCSS - // or  multiline /* */ in SASS its similar but nesting is also used and there is no need for ending */
SCSS is going to be used & is recommended

2 - Day 2: Nesting
Nesting is not available is regular CSS
Nesting is where you write a selector inside another selector
You are able to go as many levels as you want
Parent Selector ampersand is replaced by parent selector when compiled
Parent selectors have multiple uses
The ampersand does not have to be at the start of the selector
 - Works very well with modernizr as you can write for browsers without certain features
 - Not all browsers support things like CSS transforms
Best practice is about 3 or 4 levels of nesting beyond this is not recommended
Nesting is also best used on pseudo classes

3 - Day 3: Nested Properties
SASS helps with CSS namespaces
Namespaces help group properties that share the same together more elegantly
Do not include properties that dont exist
Properties have short hand notation

4 - Day 4: Variables
Variables can be used for several things
 - They start with # 
 - Values that repeat
 - You just change the value in one place
 - You are able to easily change values
 - You can use operations on variables
 - Variables defined at root are available in all selectors
 - Variables defined inside selectors are only available in the selector defined unless the flag !global is used

5 - Day 5: Interpolation

6 - Day 6: Data Types

7 - Day 7: Operations
