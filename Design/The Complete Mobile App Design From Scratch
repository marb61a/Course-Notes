                    Section: 3 - The Color Anthology
1 - Color Theory
2 theories that explain how colours work
 - Additive or light deals with radiated and filtered light. 
 - Subtractive or Pigment theory deals with how white light is absorbed and reflected off of coloured surfaces
Light Theory
 - This starts with black -- the absence of light. When colours of all frequencies are radiated together the result is white light. 
   The interaction of the colours is diagrammed using a colour wheel with RGB as primary (starting) colours which are the three 
   colours that th cones in the eye sense.
Colour Temperature
 - The colour wheel is useful as it shows the relationship between warm and cool colurs. This is called colour temperature and relates
   to the sense of temperature that each colour imparts. Colours on the Red side are called warm colours and on the green side cool
   colours.
There are multiple different colour schemes
Monochromatic Colour
  - These schemes are made up of different tones, shades and tints within a specific hue
  - They are the simplest schemes to create
Analogous Colour
  - These are the next easiest to create
  - They all have one hue in common
  - More hue contrasts are possible
  - Increasingly difficult to make good colour combinations
Complimentary Colour
  - This scheme uses colours opposite on the colour wheel
  - They are as far apart (hue wise)as colours can be
  - Consist of only 2 colurs but can be expanded with tints, shades etc
Triadic Colour
  - Three or more equally spaced colours
  - Red, Yellow and Blue works for Disney
  - Lots of colours so choose which ones communicate what you want
Tint & Shade
  - If a colour has white added its a tint, if black is added its shade

4 - All About Hue, Saturation and Value
Colour has 3 main proprties
- Hue -- The traditional colour name of a specific wavelength of light is HUe
- Saturation -- Concerned with the intensity or brightness and dullness of a colour. A saturated colour is high in intensity. A colour
that is dull in intensity is unsaturated. Another term for intensity is Chroma. A colour without brightness is achromatic
- Value -- Concerned with the light and dark values of a colour. All colours have these properties.

5 - The Psychology of Color
The psychology of colour is based on the mental and emotional effects that colour has on people (sighted)
Colur Psychology has subjective elements as well as accepted standards
Colour Psychology can also have cultural factors influencing it

  - Yellow -- Warmth, Optimism
  - Orange -- Friendly, Cheerful
  - Red -- Exhuberent, Bold
  - Light Purple -- Wise, Creative
  - Blue -- Trust, Dependable
  - Green -- Nature, Stability
Demo of words associated with colours and brands that use them
Colour Perception is subjective



                    Section: 4 - The Anatomy of Typography
1 - What is Typography
Typography is the art and technique of arranging type
Most people do not think about type or the pschological effect it has in conveying a message
Typography plays a critical role in strengthening your brand
It attracts an audiences attention as it conveys a certain mood or feeling
Your audience needs to understand what message you are trying to send and be interested in it.
Having the appropriate font sets the tone for you audiences before you even begin
It establishes an information hierarchy by using different font sizes and types
Audiences are able to determine the most important points of your text just by looking at it
Makes it easier for audience to follow you design
Using the same font in an advert keeps is simple

2 - The Fundamental of Typography
Discusions of common font Serif
Tracking is the spacing between characters within a text
Tracking is standard but can be adjusted to increase text density
Kerning is similar to tracking but refers to the specific white space between certain characters that may clash
Leading measures the space between where the letters sit ie the line above and below where a line of text sits
