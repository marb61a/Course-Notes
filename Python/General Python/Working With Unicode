If parsing through large amounts of texts you are likely to have run into some unicode related issues
Expanded character sets will also necessitate using unicode
The course will benefit students who
  - Have a limited background with using unicode
  - Would like to better understand unicode errors in Python
  - Are moving from Python 2 to Python 3
  - Need to adapt existing software to a multilingual environment
The goals for the course
  - Work with unicode in Python
  - Avoid unicode related problems
  - Understand what is happening when things go wrong
  - Implement solutions to problems when the arise
The chapter also contains a quick run through of the syllabus of the course.
  - The course will cover Python 2 & 3
