                      Functional Programming With Python
                      Course Notes
                      
                      Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Introduction
A very quick run through of the syllabus
The course will be making use of Python libraries in the course including
  - Toolz -- A general purpose utility library for functional programming in Python
  - Pyrsistent -- Provides high-performance immutable data structures
  - Hypothesis -- Gives property based testing
  - Effect -- Allows for side effects in pure functions

2 - Libraries And Setting Up Our Environment
Author recommends using if you are not familiar with setting up python environment

3 - About The Author
A quick biography of the author

4 - How to Access your Working Files
How to use the working files that came with the course



                      Section 2 - Functional Programming
1 - What is Functional Programming
Functional Programming is like it says programming functions
  - There is a difference between functions in imperative programming and functions as in Functional Programming
There are fewer classes, control flow primitives and mutations as functions can give the same power  
Functional programming comes from the mathematical idea of functions
A Side Effect is
  - Comes from non-mathematical functions
  - If has an effect on the state of the world
  - It is observable from outside
  - Functions without side effects are called pure functions
Example Syntax
  // This is a pure function
  def append2_a(l):
    return l + [2]
  
  // This function has a side effect
  def append2_b(l):
    l.append(2)
    return l
  
  l = [1]
  append2_a(l)
Code with side effects can be more difficult to maintain and debug
Some side effects are necessary
  - Read input interactively
  - Display things to the screev
  - Communicate over the network
  - You will need to sort out what is necessary and unnecessary
