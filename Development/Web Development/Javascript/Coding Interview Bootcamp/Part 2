                    Course Notes Part 2


4 - String Reversal, Solution #3
Example Syntax
  // Another solution this time using array helper methods
  function reverse(str){
    // Reduce was added in ES5.1
    // It takes all the values in an array and condenses them down to a singular value
    // It takes 2 values, the first is a function and the second is a initialising value
    return str.split('').reduce((reversed, character) => {
      return character + reversed;
    }, '');
  }
  
  module.exports = reverse;

5 - Debugger Statements
Debugging can be tough and tests may not be appropriate for helping with debugging
Using the debugger statement will pause execution
  - To use a debugger you will have to manually call the function
  - To run the file so it can be debugged at the cli
    - node inspect index.js
  - This will run and pause the file at the debugger statement
  - You will also have a special debug prompt available
  - To tell the debugger to continue execution there are a couple of different options available
    - At the debug prompt type either cont or c
  - You must enter repl mode to inspect a variable
    - At the debug prompt enter repl
    - This gives a new JS console where variables etc can be inspected
  - repl and debug can be used to audit and develop codebases
  - Using repl and debug is highly recommended
  - Using the debugger in a for loop etc will call it multiple times
  - Ensure that when finished that both the debugger statement and manual function call are removed



                    Section 4 – Paldinromes
1 - Palindromes
Palindromes are words that are the same backwards and forwards
  - ABBA for example is a palindrome

2 - Palindromes, Solution #1
Example Syntax
  // The first solution to whether a given word is a palindrome
  function palindrome(str){
    const reversed = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    
    // This will produce a boolean value on whether the 2 strings are equal
    return str === reversed;
  }
  
  module.exports = palindrome;

3 - Palindromes, Alternate Solution
Example Syntax
  // An alternative solution to whether a given word is a palindrome
  function palindrome(str){
    
  }
  
  module.exports = palindrome;


                    Section 5 – Integer Reversal
1 - Reversing an Int
The challenge in this section is to take an integer and return an integer that is the reverse
  - For example 15 would be 51, 987 would be 789 etc 
  - This has a lot in common with the previous reversing example
  - This problem as a lot of tricks and is good for practice at an interview
    - When reversing 0 will disappear at the end eg 500 will become 5
    - Using negative numbers is similar eg -25 becomes -52 and -90 becomes -9
  - The end result has to be a number not a string

2 - Reversing an Int Solution
Example Syntax
  // The solution to the Int reversing
  function reverseInt(n){
    // The code is much more legible using the two statements
    const reversed  = n.toString().split('').reverse().join('');
    
    // This will return an integer value from the string, Math.sign will multiply the value by
    // 1 if a positive value and -1 if it is a negative value
    return parseInt(reversed) * Math.sign(n);
    
  }
  
  module.exports = reverseInt;
