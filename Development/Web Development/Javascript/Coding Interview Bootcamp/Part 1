                    The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures
                    Course Notes
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Get Started Here!
1 - How to Get Help
The various resources that students can use to get their questions answered
This is mainly the question and answer section on Udemy but the instructor's twitter can be used if needed

2 - The All Important Coding Interview
Interviews and interview questions requires a specific frame of mind
There are 2 different phases to getting development jobs
  - Contact Phase
    - Referral, Contact recruiter, Submit CV etc
  - Interview Phase
    - Phone Screen, Onsite Interview, Take home assignment
    - The ability to code is the single most important part during this time
    - This is the part of a candidate that the course aims to improve

3 - Getting Better at Coding Questions
There are 3 big tools available
  - Take home assignments
  - Pair Programming at a computer, this tans to be more practical eg tools, frameworks etc 
  - Whiteboarding, which is used by a lot of larger companies
There is no quick solution, practice is the only way to improve



                    Section 2 – A Touch of Setup
1 - Don't Skip Me!

2 - Environment Setup
Cloning the repo that will be used during the course
Jest will need to be installed (Globally) for testing
  - sudo npm install -g jest
  - On Windows sudo is not needed

3 - Repo Test Setup
A quick look at the folder and file structure of the repo
  - The exercises folder is the one which concerns students
  - There are tests already written to be ran against solutions
  - Jest is a test runner which will run tests on problem solutions

4 - Link to Github Repo

                    Section 3 – String Reversal
1 - First Question! Reverse String.
The first question is to return a new string with the character order of a given string reversed

2 - String Reversal, Solution #1
Example Syntax
  // A solution to the string reversal problem
  // This is probably the easiest solution but may not be the most obvious
  // This solution might be disallowed at an interview, it maybe better to use a more complex solution
  // as it will give an interviewer a better impression of you and your abilities
  function reverse(str){
    // Splitting a string using .split() splits it into an array (Of characters in this case)
    const arr = str.split('');
    
    // The JS reverse() function works on Arrays
    arr.reverse();
    
    // Rejoin and return the string
    return arr.join('');
    
    // A more concise version of the above is
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
  }
  
  module.exports = reverse;

3 - String Reversal, Solution #2
Example Syntax
  // A second solution to the String Reversal problem
  function reverse(str){
    // Where possible avoid writing for loops using classic syntax
    // Mistakes are easy to make eg typos or wrong tense etc
    let reversed = '';
    
    // The for-of syntax was introduced in ES2015
    // This iterates through the str iterable object 
    for(let character of str){
      reversed = character + reversed;
    }
    
    return reversed;
  }
  
  module.exports = reverse;
