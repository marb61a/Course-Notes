2 - ES6 vs ES2015
Discussion on the course
ECMAScript\ES 6 is a standard, Javascript is an implementation of that standard



                    Section: 2 - The 'forEach' Helper
1 - Array Helper Methods - The Easiest Way to Write Better Code
Some of the most valuable topics in the next couple of sections are Array helper methods
  - forEach, map, filter, find, every, some, reduce
Some of theses were implemeented in utility libraries
  - Lodash & Underscore
Initially added into ES 5.1 and codified in ES6
These helpers work similar to each other
Author highly recommends getting very familiar with array helper methods
You are supposed to avoid using for loops

2 - The forEach Helper
ES5 Example
var colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];
for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++){
  console.log(colors[i]);
}
Instructor recommends avoiding writing for loops

ES6 Syntax
colors.forEach(function(color){
  console.log(color);
});

forEach works the same as a for loop with a lot less code\logic on display

3 - forEach Continued
Task is to 
  - Create an array of numbers
  - Create a variable to hold the sum
  - Loop over the array, incrementing the sum
  - Print the sum
  
Syntax
  var number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  var sum = 0;

  numbers.forEach(function(number){ // function does not have to be anonymous
    sum += number;
  });
  sum;

Named function syntax
  var number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  var sum = 0;
  
  function adder(number){
    sum += number;  
  }  
  numbers.forEach(adder);
  sum;

4 - Why Use forEach?
forEach is the Swiss Army Knife of array helpers
Example using deleting an email as an example of a use case of forEach() 

5 - Exercise 1
Solution Syntax
  function handlePosts() {
    var posts = [
      { id: 23, title: 'Daily JS News' },
      { id: 52, title: 'Code Refactor City' },
      { id: 105, title: 'The Brightest Ruby' }
    ];
    
    posts.forEach(function(post){
        savePost(posts[i]);    
    });
    
    // for (var i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) {
    //   savePost(posts[i]);
    // }
}

6 - Exercise 2
Solution Syntax
  var images = [
    { height: 10, width: 30 },
    { height: 20, width: 90 },
    { height: 54, width: 32 }
  ];
  var areas = [];

  images.forEach(function(image){
      var area = image.height * image.width;
      areas.push(area);
  });
