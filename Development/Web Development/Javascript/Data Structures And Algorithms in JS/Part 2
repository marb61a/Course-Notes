                    Data Structures And Algorithms in Javascript 
                    Course Notes Part 2


                    Section 2 - Stacks & Queues
1 - Stacks
Stacks and Queues are used everywhere
Ingredients to learn Data Structures
1 - Learn Data Structure Concept
  - Draw It
  - Create The AP\Operation Methods
2 - Build The Data Strucure
  - Pseudocode The Implementation
  - Code The Data Structure Constructor
3 - Utilize The Data Structure
  - Put The Dta Structure To Work
  - Pair It With An Algorithm If Needed
4 - Understand The Data Structure
  - What Is Time Complexity
  - How Can You Optimise

Stacks
  - An elementary data structure
  - Last In First Out
  - You can only push and pop
  - An example is the Call Stack
  
2 - Stacks Interface
Interface Stacks
  1 - Constructor Function
    - storage
  2 - Methods
    - push() -- Adds value to the front, returns the size of the stack
    - pop() -- Removes value from the front, returns value
    - size() -- Returns the stack size as an integer
    
Example Syntax if there was no arrays
  var Stack = function(){
    this.storage = "";
  };
  Stack.prototype.push = function(val){
    this.storage = this.storage.concat("***", val);
  };
  Stack.prototype.pop = function(){
    var str = this.storage.slice(this.storage.lastIndexOf("***") + 3);
    this.storage = this.storage.substring(0, this.storage.lastIndexOf("***"));
    return str;
  };
  Stack.prototype.size = function(){
  
  };
  var myWeeklyMenu = new Stack();
  myWeeklyMenu.push("RedBeans");
  

3 - Implementing a Stack
A continuation of the previous example
Optimisations could include
  - Assigning to a variable
  - Ensuring that variable name is appropriate

4 - Queues
Similar to Stacks but are First In First Out (FIFO) in operation
  - In also called enqueued 
  - Out is also called dequeued
Website alert popups use queues
Interface Queues
1 - Constructor Function
  - Storage
2 - Methods
  - Enqueue
  - Dequeue
  - size()
