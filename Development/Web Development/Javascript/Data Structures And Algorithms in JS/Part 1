                    Data Structures And Algorithms in Javascript 
                    Course Notes Part 1
                    
                    
                    Section 1 - Object Oriented JavaScript
1 - Introduction
Course instructor uses the cooking metapthor for describing what way the course will proceed
You will need to do practical examples so to understand implementation rather than the theory
This is a very complex topic so will need regular practice
An introduction to the course author

2 - Agenda and Scope
A run through of the agenda that the course will cover
The first section will be very valuable for people with out extensive experience in recursion
The Class is
  - A practical introduction to data structures and algorithms in JS
  - It uses carefully curated topics based on univeristy level CS classes and common technical interview topics
  - A good start for anybody who wishes to improve their skills by mastering the fundamentals
  - It will be useless if practical exercises are not finished
The Class is not
  - Every data structure and algorithm ever invented
  - The only inplementation or best solution to every cases
  - A math heavy or theory based course on the analysis of algorithms
  - The end all study tool for interview preparation
  - A smooth friendly journey, there is a lot of content so it will be challenging

3 - How to Succeed
A run through of some false assumption to help you succeed
Most technical interviews are not good measurements of technical ability
How to succeed
  - Don't participate in the false assumptions
  - Pair with someone else doing the course
  - Do the exercises without looking at the solutions
  - Be OK with failing and don't give up
  - Ask Questions
A Guide To Pair Programming
  - This can be tough at first but helps a lot for interview prep
  - Communicate deliberately and be specific
  - One person gets to be the driver and the other navigates
  - The driver types, the navigator talks through the code
  - Use codeshare.io for remote viewing
  - Be courteous

4 - Pseudoclassical JavaScript
JS is an Object-Oriented language
It does not have a formal way of creating class constructors like most languages, this is why the term pseudoclasses is used
This is not true of ES6 as it does have a class keyword

5 - Defining a Class
A class can be thought of in 3 terms
  - What is it
  - What does it have
  - What does it do
The foundation of OO is based on whats vs actions in functional programming
Demo of creating a class
Demo Syntax
  function Building(floors){
    this.what = "Building";
    this.floors = floors;
  }
  var myHouse = new Building(3);
There is a quick discussion using prototype in JS

6 - Using a Class
Basic demonstration of calling the class using various means
Things to note
  - There are several methods of creating classes in JS
  - Pseudoclassical is industry standard and is expected knowledge at an interview
  - You may see elements of this style in JS framework

7 - Exercise: Creating a Constructor
Create a unique constructor that makes a building of your choice using the pseudoclassical pattern
Add methods and create instances

8 - Creating a Constructor Solution
One example was chosen 
Example Syntax
  var Yurt = function(ribs){
    this.ribs = ribs;
  }
  
  Yurt.prototype.countRibs = function(){
    if(this.ribs > 10){
      console.log("YUM!!");
    } else {
      console.log("MORE!!!");
    }
  } 
  myHouse = new Yurt(50);
The keyword this has several different rules
