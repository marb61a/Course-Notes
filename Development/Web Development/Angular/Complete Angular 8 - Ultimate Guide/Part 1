                    Complete Angular 8 - Ultimate Guide - with Real World App 
                    Course Notes Part 1


Introduction & Basics of Angular 8
Course Introduction
  - The course is aimed at both beginners and experienced developers
  - There will be a sample real world project

Introduction to Angular
  - Angular is a very popular frontend web framework
    - https://angular.io/
  - It is also used in Ionic which is a mobile development framework
  - It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework
  - Angular is developed by Google
  - It has its own cli for doing things like generating components quickly
  - Angular features
    - Application state which is stored in the component
    - Application logic which is written in the component
    - Design logic which is written in the template
    - Business logic which is written in services

Where to Start Practical
  - The practical section starts in section 2
  - The rest of this section is theory

Where to Download Course Material
  - Materials are available for downloading on the last lecture of the course

Goals of Angular
  - The goals and advantages of Angular
  - Separation of DOM manipulation logic from application logic
    - This means that in most cases there is little need to write code for manipulating DOM elements at run time
  - Separation of HTML logic from application logic
    - HTML logic in this case is the code used to design the UI
    - The tradition approach was to have programming and design logic mixed
    - This can be problematic and is difficult to perform unit tests on
    - HTML logic is written in the template, application logic in the component
  - Separation of business logic from application logic
    - Business logic is the code used to fetch data from sources
    - It works by making AJX calls and custom validations
    - This should independent of the user interface
  - Make Single Page Application (SPA) development easier
  - Make your code easier to maintain
  - Another goal is to make your code base as friendly as possible to unit tests

Code Compilation Process in Angular
  - Application source code which is written in TypeScript
    - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which adds type safety and other features
  - This code is then passed into the TypeScript compiler
    - This is needed as browsers will not run TypeScript
    - This compiles TypeScript code into browser firendly JavaScript
  - Separately templates are written in HTML code
  - These templates are then passed into the Angular compiler where thay are converted in JavaScript
  - All of this code is then execute by the browser
