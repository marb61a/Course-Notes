                                  Learn and Understand NodeJS
                                  Course notes Part 1
                                            

                    Section 1 - Introduction and setup
1 - Introduction and course goal
Basic introduction to the course and what the goal of the course is.

2 - Big Words and NodeJS
Learning NodeJS can be intimadting due to some of the terminology involved, the instructor has devised an
excellent strategy for handling this issue which is to specifically address these terms using "Big Word Alerts"
these are then broken down into to simple explanations.

3 - Watching the course
There are different video resolutions available and where possible it should be viewed in the highest 
resolution possible in order to fully observe what the instructor is doing.

4 - Command Line Interface
A basic guide to using the command line, there are huge amounts of indepth tutorials on using the cli
and it is highly recommended to do some learning as these skill are very transferable.

5 - Command Line References
Not necessary for the course to know CLI but if you want to learn
 - http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/



                    Section 2 - V8: The Javascript Engine
1 - Conceptual Aside: Processors, Machine Language, and C++
Processors - Processors or CPU (Central Processing Unit)
  - The CPU is often referred to as the brain of the computer
  - Many new computer users may improperly call their computer and sometimes their monitor the CPU
  - Intel and AMD are leading makers of CPU for PC type computers, ARM for devices like phones etc
  - On the PC the main platform is x86 & x64 which take in 32 and 64 pieces of information in parallel

Machine Language - This is a language which a computer can respond to directly
  - Programs written in high-level languages are translated into assembly language or machine language by a compiler
  - Every CPU has its own unique machine language

C++ - The main ISO standard C++ site is located at
  - https://isocpp.org
  - C++ is a general purpose Object-Oriented Language
  - Used extensively in places like Games drivers etc
  - Tutorials on C++ available at
    - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/

2 - Javascript Aside: Javascript Engines and The ECMAScript Specification
Javascript is a trade name
ECMAScript - The standard on which Javascript is based
ECMA is a standards agency - https://www.ecma-international.org
Javascript engines should match ECMA standard
An engine is something that converts JS into machine code

3 - V8 Under the Hood
The v8 engine is an open source JavaScript engine
It is written in C++ and implements ECMAScript Standard

4 - Adding Features to Javascript
Demonstration of the features added to Javascript by the V8 engine
C++ files usually have either cc or cpp file extensions


                    Section 3: The Node Core
1 - Conceptual Aside: Servers and Clients
A quick, very high level overview of client - server architecture.
There are explanations of the various architectures used including client - server at
http://tutorials.jenkov.com/software-architecture/client-server-architecture.html

2 - What Does Javascript Need to Manage a Server?

3 - The C++ Core
Lecture begins by looking at the NodeJS source code using Github
There is a quick overview of some of the folders within the NodeJS source code.
There is a lot of C++ code in the src folder

4 - The Javascript Core
Another quick look at the folder structure in the NodeJS souce code but this time looking at the
Javascript end as oppposed to the previous example.

5 - Downloading Lecture Source Code (Article)
Instructions on how to download the source code used in examples

6 - Let's Install and Run Some Javascript in Node
