                    Course Notes Part 3


Release Planning
The ideals ways to conduct Release Planning are
  - Deliver high-value functionality to the customer sooner rather than later.
  - Release Planning meetings ensure shared expectations for delivery timelines between a Scrum team, 
    - Product Owner & other stakeholders 
  - Release Strategies
    – Continuous Deployment – feature centered
    – Phased Deployment – time-centered
  - Needs to reflect organizational release planning and priorities
Some of the outputs of release planning are
  - Release Planning schedule usually evolves as the project progresses
  - The length of Sprint
    – Most Scrum practices max out at 4 weeks
    - Some last 6 weeks
    - Many prefer shorter Sprints of 2 or 3 weeks
    – Sprint Length should be consistent across a project.
  - Define Target Customers for a release
  - Product Owner may update Prioritized Project Backlog

                    
                    Course 04 - Planning & Estimating a Project 
Creating user stories 
User group meetings & workshops write Epics and create user stories.
  - User stories describe
    – Requirements
    – Increments of desired functionality
    – Story acceptance criteria
  - A user story tells
    – Who uses the system
    – What work the system performs
    – Why this is valuable to the customer
  - The Prioritized Product Backlog is a dynamic list of User Stories in priority order
    – Developed and maintained by the Product Owner
User Stories follow a specific format such as
  - As a <insert role or persona here>, I should be able to <do this thing I want to do> so that <I get a benefit I want>
User Stories will have to meet certain criteria to be accepted
  - Because User Stories are subjective, the Acceptance Criteria enable the team to establish objective measures
    of whether a User Story is Done or Not Done.
  - The Product Owner defines & communicates the Acceptance Criteria to the Scrum team.
  - THe Scrum Master ensures that the Product Owner does not change the Acceptance Criteria during a Sprint.
  - Any new Acceptance Criteria that are identified during a Sprint can be written into 
    - new User Stories for subsequent Sprints.
The outputs for writing User Stories are
  - The User Stories
  - User Story Acceptance Criteria
  - Updates to the Prioritized Product Backlog
  - Updated or Refined Personae

User Group Meetings are used to 
  - Engage Relevant Stakeholders
    - This is primarily users or customers for the product
  - Provide the Scrum Team with first hand user expectations
    - This often provides valuable insights for epics
  - Prevent expensive rework resulting from ambiguity
  - Promote buy-in for project

Planning Poker
  - Use a deck of cards numbered in some sequence
    - Each team member will have their own deck
  - Product Owner presents a User Story to the team.
  - The Scrum team assess and asks questions about the story to tryto understand it
  - Each team member picks a card to reflect their estimate for that story
    – Number chosen represents team member estimation of difficulty or effort (depending on team member)
  - If the majority select the same card, continue with next story
    – Agreed card is the estimated effort for “this” story.
  - No consensus: outliers are given opportunity to discuss their selection followed by another round of card selection
    – Discussion and card selection continues until there is agreement 

Fist of Five
  - This is a relatively simple mechanism used to drive discussions and if possible achieve consensus
  - After the discussion has completed  the Scrum Master asks the team to vote on a 1-5 scale.
  - Each team member is asked to explain their vote, to allow for addressing team member concerns. This usually looks like
    - I strongly disagree with the group’s conclusions and have major concerns
    - I disagree with the group’s conclusions and would like to discuss some minor issues
    - I am not sure and would like to go with the group’s consensus conclusion
    - I agree with the group’s conclusion and would like to discuss some minor issues
    - I strongly agree with the group’s conclusions

Points for Cost Estimations
  - This uses Story points, not monetary units
  - Estimation technique in relative terms.
  - In trying to estimate costs to complete a User Story, it is often helpful to have a benchmark.
  - A Baseline User Story could equal 10 points for example
  - How many story points of effort will User Story cost?
    – Relative to the baseline story
  - Decisions are not changed during a Sprint
  
There are other methodologies available for estimation including
  - Wideband Delphi
    - More information on Wideband Delphi available here

  - Affinity Estimation
    - Tutorial on Affinity Estimation available at

  - Estimate Ranges

The outputs from the  Approve, Estimate & Commit User Stories
  - User Stories Committed by the Team for the Sprint
  - Basis for Sprint Backlog
  - Product Owner approves the initial User Stories for a Sprint
  - Final Decision lies with the Scrum team (with consultation from the Product Owner as needed)
