                    Scrum Developer Series
                    Course Notes Part 4


The Task Planning Meeting
  - It runs at the beginning of every Sprint
    - It is some times referrred to as The Sprint Planning Meeting
  - It contains 2 main parts
    - What to do
      - Product Owner and Development Team
      - Select items from the product backlog for inclusion in the sprint
    - How to do it
      - Development Team
      - Identify & estimate tasks to turn selected User Stories into increment of functionality
  - The meeting is time-boxed
    - 2 hours for each week in the sprint
    - Time is split evenly between the 2 main parts
  - The Product Owner
    - Confirms the accuracy of the product backlog
The Task Planning Meeting has 2 parts
  - User Stories
    - The product owner suggests User Stories for the sprint
    - The Scrum Team determines how many stories it can deliver in the sprint
    - A consensus is reached on the stories to be included in the sprint
  - Tasks
    - The Scrum team breaks down the User Stories into Tasks to create a Product Increment
    - The Scrum team commits to deliverables
Using Index Cards
  - User Stories are written on small Index Cards
  - Only Essential Details are documented
  - Using Index Cards will
    – Facilitate Collaboration and discussion
    – Increase visibility and transparency
    – Reduce risk and assist with problem determination
Decomposition
  - Breaks down tasks into lower-level, more detailed tasks.
  - All User Stories should be sufficiently decomposed to allow the Scrum team to create the desired deliverables from
    the tasks mentioned in the task list.
Determine Dependencies
  - Once the tasks have been idenfified then its time to consider people and technical dependencies
    - Mandatory dependencies
    – Discretionary dependencies
    – External dependencies
    – Internal dependencies
The oututs generated for the Create Tasks are
  - Task List
  - Updates to the Approved, Estimated, and Committed User Stories
  - Dependencies

Estimating the Tasks
Task Estimation Meetings
  - These are often combined with Task/Sprint Planning Meetings
  - They are used to estimate
    - People
    - Resources Needed
    - Use Task List to drive shared perspective
  - They use the techniques discussed above eg Poker Planning etc
Establish the Estimation Criteria
  - Keep sizes relative
  - Minimize the need for re-estimating
  - Samples include
    – Story Points
    – Ideal time i.e. how long it would take without interruptions
The outputs generated for Estimating Tasks are
  - Effort Estimated Task List
    – Provides key input for producing the Sprint Backlog and Sprint Burndown Chart
    – Allows the team to see if they can take on more commitment or reduce commitment for a Sprint
  - Updated Task List

Creating the Sprint Backlog
  - The Spring Backlog take input from the following sources
    - Committed User Stories
    - Changes
    - Risks
    - Effort Estimated Task list
  - The Sprint Backlog is simply the list of User Stories to be delivered in that sprint
  - A Scrumboard helps organise the stories and the tasks
Velocity
  - Measure of the number of User Stories/Sprint done
  - Useful in longer-term planning of progress across many Sprints
  - Can provide input and measures of team affinity and improved efficiency and effectiveness of practices
  - Improved velocity comes from more effective practices and better teamwork
Sprint has tracking metrics that it uses
  - Business value delivered which is the value of the User Stories from a business perspective
  - Number of User Stories (nominal or weighted)
  - Velocity (up/down)
The outpust that omer from creating the Spring Backlog ar
  - Sprint Backlog
  - Sprint Burndown Chart
