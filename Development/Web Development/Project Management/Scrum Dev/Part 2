An Epic is a large collection of high-level unrefined user stories which are
  - Desired functionality
  – Easy to understand
  – Estimable
  – Used to craft more detailed user stories
You can gather requirements for Epics in 
  - User Group Meetings
  – User Story Workshops
  – Focus Group Meetings
  – User/Customer Interviews
  – Questionnaires
Used to identify & write customer requirements
They can help
  – Formulate acceptance criteria
  – Product Owner prioritizes requirements
  – Team identifies and assess risk
Epics tell a story for example, What would the customers and users like to happen?
Personae describe an example bringing the connection to life eg How would the solution drive value for a specific type of stakeholder?
Developing Epics will create certain outputs
  - Epics
  - Personae
  - Approved Changes
  - Identified Risks

The Prioritized Product Backlog is a prioritized list of Epics, User Stories, Changes, and maybe Risks to be managed during the project
The Product Owner normally develops and maintains  Prioritized Product Backlog
  - On occasion the Scrum Master may facilitate User Group Workshops or Focus groups to help prioritize options
There are several techniques used is crating the Prioritized Product Backlog
  - MoSCoW analysis
  – Paired Comparisons
  – 100 Point Method
  – Kano Analysis
MoSCoW analysis -- MoSCoW is an acronym which stands for 
  - Must have -- Defines a requirement that has to be satisfied for the final solution to be acceptable
  - Should have -- A high priority requirement that should be included if possible within the time delivery box
  - Could Have -- This is a desirable or nice-to-have requirement but the solution will still be acceptable without it
  - Won't Have -- These are requirements that the stakeholders have agreed will not be implemented in this version.
Paired Comparisons
  - List all of the User Stories
  - Compare them, two at a time
  - Keep going until all the User Stories are prioritized
100 Point Method
  - Each user gets 100 points to vote for User Stories
  - Points can be allocated among the stories any way a user wishes
  - Aggregated point total drives the prioritization
Kano Analysis Classifies features as
  – Exciters/Delighters
  – Satisfiers
  – Dissatisfiers
  – Indifferent 
Other considerations are also needed and inputs prioritized
  - User Group Meeting feedback
  - Plan for Value
    – Value Stream mapping
  - Risk Assessment
  - Project Value Estimation
  - User Story Estimation methods
    – Planning Poker
    – Fist of Five
  - Scrum Guidance Body (SGB) Guidance
The outputs generated from the planning of the Prioritized Product Backlog include
  - Prioritized Product Backlog
    - Value Centered
    - Manages Risk and Uncertainty in Priority
    – Identifies Dependencies
    – Estimates
  - Done Criteria
    - A set of Rules applicable to all User Stories
