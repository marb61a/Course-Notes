                    Course 06 - Sprint Review and Retrospect 
The Scrum Cycle Review and Retrospect
  - Sprint Review
  - Accept Deliverables
  - Retrospect Scrum

Convening a Scrum of Scrums
  - Bigger projects, Programs and Portfolios of products will require scalability and integration
  - Scrum itself scales through using regular integration points
  - Roles can then be aligned across the different levels
  - Chief Product Owner -> Program Product Owner -> PO
  - Chief Scrum Master -> Program Scrum Master -> SM
  - Alignment is maintained using a Scrum of Scrums

A Scrum of Scrums
  - Relatively short but not time boxed in order to allow for information to be shared
  - There will be one representative from each Scrum team which is usually the Scrum Master of that team
  - It is held at predetermined times or can be held when required
  - This helps to monitor
    - Project Risks
    - Any issues
    - Dependencies
  - There are usually 4 questions per team which is similar to the 3 questions for a team member in individual Scrums
    - What has my team worked on since the last meeting?
    - What will my team do until the next meeting?
    - What were other teams counting on our team to finish that remains undone?
    - What does our team plan to do that might affect other teams?
  - Teams may need to use video conferencing for non colocated teams
The outputs generated from the Scrum of Scrums
  - There will be better team cordination
  - Issues will be resolved
  - There will be updates to 
    - The impediment log
    - Dependencies

Sprint Review Meeting
  - Each Sprint produces whole capabilities: demonstrable user stories end-to-end
  - The sprint review meeting will offer an opportunity to
    - Demonstrate the completed User Stories to the Product Owner and other Stakeholders
    - It allows the Product Owner to confirm stories have been completed
    - Consider stakeholder requested changes for subsequent Sprints
    - Identify issues that occurred and how the team resolved them
    - Update the Product Backlog when the Product Owner reviews
  - The focus of this meeting is on the product being delivered
Tracking Overall Progress
  - Gantt charts are of limited use when tracking the overall value generated by a project
  - In Scrum the follwoing are rcommended instead
    - Earned Value Analysis
      - More information available at -- https://www.wbdg.org/resources/earned-value-analysis
    - Cumulative Flow Diagrams
      - More info -- http://kanbantool.com/kanban-library/analytics-and-metrics/explaining-cumulative-flow-diagrams#.WQrugWhtnIU
The outputs generated by the demonstrate and validate sprint are
  - Accepted Deliverables
  - Rejected Deliverables which are returned to the product backlog
  - Updated diferrent sections
    - Risks
    - Release Plans
    - Dependencies
  - Earned Value results

Conducting the Retrospect Sprint Meeting
  - Retrospect meetings will help a team inprove its performance
  - Held in an open relaxed environment after the Sprint Review at the end of the Sprint

Explorer-Shopper-Vacationer-Prisoner (ESVP)
  - This is a technique used by the Scrum Master to assess the engagement and participation in the Retrospect
    - Explorer
      - This person wants to participate in and learn everything from the Retrospect
    - Shopper
      - This person wants to listen to everything and choose what they take away from the retrospect

Speed Boat
  - This is a technique that is used in Scrum to identify team improvements
  - The team members will role play a team on a ship trying to reach its destination
