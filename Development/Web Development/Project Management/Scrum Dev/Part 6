Convening a Scrum of Scrums
  - Bigger projects, Programs and Portfolios of products will require scalability and integration
  - Scrum itself scales through using regular integration points
  - Roles can then be aligned across the different levels
  - Chief Product Owner -> Program Product Owner -> PO
  - Chief Scrum Master -> Program Scrum Master -> SM
  - Alignment is maintained using a Scrum of Scrums

A Scrum of Scrums
  - Relatively short but not time boxed in order to allow for information to be shared
  - There will be one representative from each Scrum team which is usually the Scrum Master of that team
  - It is held at predetermined times or can be held when required
  - This helps to monitor
    - Project Risks
    - Any issues
    - Dependencies
  - There are usually 4 questions per team which is similar to the 3 questions for a team member in individual Scrums
    - What has my team worked on since the last meeting?
    - What will my team do until the next meeting?
    - What were other teams counting on our team to finish that remains undone?
    - What does our team plan to do that might affect other teams?
  - Teams may need to use video conferencing for non colocated teams
The outputs generated from the Scrum of Scrums
  - There will be better team cordination
  - Issues will be resolved
  - There will be updates to 
    - The impediment log
    - Dependencies
