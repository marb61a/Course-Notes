Build Deliverables 
  - Scrum teams produce working and potentially shippable solutions in each sprint
  - Including all necessary cross functional work
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Development
    - Testing
    - Demonstration at the Sprint Review Meeting
  - There are many organisations the use the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology
    - Write a test
    - Fail the test
    - Write enough code to pass the test
    - Refactor the code for a better solution
  - This can dramatically reduce Technical Debt and speeds up the delivery of value to a business
    - Technical Debt is a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy
      to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution
Refactoring Code
  - This is specific to Software projects
  - The goal is to improve both the quality and maintainability of the code
    - It can be simpler
    - More concise
    - More flexible
  - Refactoring will change the flow and design of the code without changing what its behaviour seems like
    - It eliminates repetitive and redundant code
    - Breaks methods and functions into smaller routines
    – Creates clearly define variables and method names
    – Simplifies code design
    – Makes code easier to understand and modify
  - It establishes the use of Design Patterns
    - More information on the Gang Of Four design patterns available at
      - https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns
The outputs for Creating deliverables are
  - Sprint Deliverables
  - Updated Scrumboard
  - Updated Impediment Log
  - Updated Risk Identification and Mitigation
  - Updated Dependencies
  - Unapproved change requests

    - What impediments or obstacles am I currently facing
  - Answers to the first two questions should be quantitative to avoid long qualitative answers

  - There has to be appropriate care given to Open Communications
    - Video Conferencing Tools
    - Easy to use collaboration tools
    - Electronic Scrumboards and Burndown charts
The outputs that are generated from the Daily Standup are
  - There are updates to
    - Sprint Burndown Chart
    – Impediment Log
    – Scrumboard
    – Unapproved Change Requests
    – Identified and Mitigated Risks
    – Dependencies
  - Team Motivation and morale will need to be monitored
    - Each member is important
    – Self-organization
    – Enhanced performance
    – Improved quality of deliverables
