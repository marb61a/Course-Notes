                    Scrum Developer Series
                    Course Notes Part 5


                   Course 05 - Implementing a Project 
 Create the deliverables
  - Obvious main activity within the sprint
    - Do the work
    – Deliver the goods
  - Along the way
    – Update the Scrumboard
    – Identify Impediments
  - Impediment Log
    – Logs any hindrance to the progress of the team
      - Can be internal or external
    – Builds an action item list for the Scrum Master
Build Deliverables 
  - Scrum teams produce working and potentially shippable solutions in each sprint
  - Including all necessary cross functional work
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Development
    - Testing
    - Demonstration at the Sprint Review Meeting
  - There are many organisations the use the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology
    - Write a test
    - Fail the test
    - Write enough code to pass the test
    - Refactor the code for a better solution
  - This can dramatically reduce Technical Debt and speeds up the delivery of value to a business
    - Technical Debt is a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy
      to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution
Refactoring Code
  - This is specific to Software projects
  - The goal is to improve both the quality and maintainability of the code
    - It can be simpler
    - More concise
    - More flexible
  - Refactoring will change the flow and design of the code without changing what its behaviour seems like
    - It eliminates repetitive and redundant code
    - Breaks methods and functions into smaller routines
    – Creates clearly define variables and method names
    – Simplifies code design
    – Makes code easier to understand and modify
  - It establishes the use of Design Patterns
    - More information on the Gang Of Four design patterns available at
      - https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns
The outputs for Creating deliverables are
  - Sprint Deliverables
  - Updated Scrumboard
  - Updated Impediment Log
  - Updated Risk Identification and Mitigation
  - Updated Dependencies
  - Unapproved change requests

                    Course 06 - Sprint Review and Retrospect 
The Scrum Cycle Review and Retrospect
  - Sprint Review
  - Accept Deliverables
  - Retrospect Scrum

Convening a Scrum of Scrums
  - Bigger projects, Programs and Portfolios of products will require scalability and integration
  - Scrum itself scales through using regular integration points
  - Roles can then be aligned across the different levels
  - Chief Product Owner -> Program Product Owner -> PO
  - Chief Scrum Master -> Program Scrum Master -> SM
  - Alignment is maintained using a Scrum of Scrums

A Scrum of Scrums
  - Relatively short but not time boxed in order to allow for information to be shared
  - There will be one representative from each Scrum team which is usually the Scrum Master of that team
  - It is held at predetermined times or can be held when required
  - This helps to monitor
    - Project Risks
    - Any issues
    - Dependencies
  - There are usually 4 questions per team which is similar to the 3 questions for a team member in individual Scrums
    - What has my team worked on since the last meeting?
    - What will my team do until the next meeting?
    - What were other teams counting on our team to finish that remains undone?
    - What does our team plan to do that might affect other teams?
  - Teams may need to use video conferencing for non colocated teams
The outputs generated from the Scrum of Scrums
  - There will be better team cordination
  - Issues will be resolved
  - There will be updates to 
    - The impediment log
    - Dependencies

Sprint Review Meeting
  - Each Sprint produces whole capabilities: demonstrable user stories end-to-end
  - The sprint review meeting will offer an opportunity to
    - Demonstrate the completed User Stories to the Product Owner and other Stakeholders
    - It allows the Product Owner to confirm stories have been completed
    - Consider stakeholder requested changes for subsequent Sprints
    - Identify issues that occurred and how the team resolved them
    - Update the Product Backlog when the Product Owner reviews
  - The focus of this meeting is on the product being delivered
Tracking Overall Progress
  - Gantt charts are of limited use when tracking the overall value generated by a project
  - In Scrum the follwoing are rcommended instead
    - Earned Value Analysis
      - More information available at -- https://www.wbdg.org/resources/earned-value-analysis
    - Cumulative Flow Diagrams
      - More info -- http://kanbantool.com/kanban-library/analytics-and-metrics/explaining-cumulative-flow-diagrams#.WQrugWhtnIU
The outputs generated by the demonstrate and validate sprint are
  - Accepted Deliverables
  - Rejected Deliverables which are returned to the product backlog
  - Updated diferrent sections
    - Risks
    - Release Plans
    - Dependencies
  - Earned Value results

Conducting the Retrospect Sprint Meeting
  - Retrospect meetings will help a team inprove its performance
  - Held in an open relaxed environment after the Sprint Review at the end of the Sprint
  - All Scrum members will attend
    - The Scrum Master will facilitate the meeting
    - Another team member will take notes/minutes
    - The Product owner may attedn but it is not a compulsory requirement
  - There are explorations of things that the team needs to keep doing
    - Keep doing – best practices
    - Begin doing – process improvement
    - Stop doing – process problems & bottlenecks
  - Results in Agreed Actionable Improvements
  - Focus is on the team’s processes & collaboration
Explorer-Shopper-Vacationer-Prisoner (ESVP)
  - This is a technique used by the Scrum Master to assess the engagement and participation in the Retrospect
    - Explorer
      - This person wants to participate in and learn everything from the Retrospect
    - Shopper
      - This person wants to listen to everything and choose what they take away from the retrospect
    - Vacationer
      - This person wants to relax and  wants to be a tourist in the Retrospect
    - Prisoner
      - This person wants to be elsewhere and is only attending because it is required
  - Votes are anonymous but the overall information will be shared with the group to set expectations
Speed Boat
  - This is a technique that is used in Scrum to identify team improvements
  - The team members will role play a team on a ship trying to reach its destination
  - The team is asked to identify
    - Engines which are things that will speed them up
    - Anchors which are thing s that will slow them down
    - All are identified and prioritised
    - Engines are acknowledged and mitigation options for anchors are identified
  - It is time boxed to a few minutes to maintain focus
