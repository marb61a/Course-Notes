                    Course Notes Part 1


1 - Course Overview Optimistic UI Updates in React
A quick overview of what the course will cover 
Optimistic Updates means that when  user performs an action the UI will update immediately
  - Even if there is a pending request there is an assumption of success
  - Action can be taken quickly if there is any failure 
  - This can result in a much more responsive UI 
    - This can give an app a much more responsive feel
  - They are not suitable for all uses cases though

2 - Examine Real World Optimistic UI Updates
The Twitter website is a real world example of optimistic UI updates in action
  - https://twitter.com
  - Opem the devtools network panel
    - When the heart icon is clicked a POST favorites method is sent
