                    Optimistic UI Updates in React
                    Course Notes 


1 - Course Overview Optimistic UI Updates in React
A quick overview of what the course will cover 
Optimistic Updates means that when  user performs an action the UI will update immediately
  - Even if there is a pending request there is an assumption of success
  - Action can be taken quickly if there is any failure 
  - This can result in a much more responsive UI 
    - This can give an app a much more responsive feel
  - They are not suitable for all uses cases though

2 - Examine Real World Optimistic UI Updates
The Twitter website is a real world example of optimistic UI updates in action
  - https://twitter.com
  - Opem the devtools network panel
    - When the heart icon is clicked a POST favorites method is sent
    - Using a slower network connection shows that although the heart total is updated the POST has not completed

3 - Optimistically Update UI for a Snappier User Experience
Example Syntax
  // Part of a demo App file
  render(){
    const {tweets, likedTweets} = this.state;
    
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <h3 className="">
        
        </h3>
        <div className="list-group">
          {
            tweets.map(() => (
              <Tweet 
              
              />
            ))
          }
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
