                    Course Notes Part 6


5 - Cache Warming & Cron Jobs 
Uncached pages have impact on User Experience when landing on the page
Uncached pages can take 5 - 10 times longer to load
Cache Warming ensures that pages are cached reuglarly to avoid cold page loads
Plugin used is Warm Cache - https://wordpress.org/plugins/warm-cache/
Crawls pages based on XML site map
Once activated if sitemap is present it will populate automatically
You should have sitemap if not generate one and enter address to plugin
You will get an additional url for Cron Jobs 
Cron Jobs are scheduled jobs
If using a proper host setting up a cron job should be easy
CPanel has cron job section
Add to command curl warm cache url
Schedule according to server resources, if possible once every 5 minutes
A tutorial using WP plugin for cron is available at

A tutorial explaning more about Cron is available at 
 - http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html
If you have activated object cache in W3 Total Cache you may run into issues


6 - Domain Sharding 
Domain Sharding is a means to get browsers to do more than they normally would
It allows more parallelized downloads of assets
The first steps means setting up site sub-domains the you will shard resources off to eg 10 per sub-domain
Most hosts will allow sub-domains but the process will be host specific
No more than 2 sub-domains, more hurts performance
You want a CName record for your sub-domains
W3 Total Cache has a CDN feature which allows for adding CName for shards
DNS can take up to 4 hours to propogate
Test Mirror button will test shards are functioning properly
Dont shard CSS or JS, it will cause loading order problems in the browser

                    Section 11 - 'Edge' Optimization: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
1 - Prefatory Remarks About Edge Optimization, CDNs & An Introduction to CloudFlare 
Site core should already optimized
Testing location distance can affect speed
CDN - Content Delivery Network
CDN - A network of servers strategically placed around the world, that delivers you site's cached content based
on the user's geographic location
CDN can help eliminate a latency
This is referred to as an edge optimisation as it will be at the outer end of your site
Cloudflare didn't start out as a CDN
 - It has a free plan
 - Provides benefits that other CDN dont
 - Cloudflare is better than most other CDN providers

2 - Installing CloudFlare 
Once you have signed up and logged in you will have a dashboard
You will need to use Cloudflare's DNS settings and change the DNS servers in your hosts to the Cloudflare DNS
Grey cloud icon means it is bypassing Cloudflare
You will usually get a notification to tell you when the propogation process is complete

4 - Page Rules Pro-Tips 
Cloudflare page rules allow for rules on a page by page basis
 - Custom cache for admin on Wordpress site which bypasses cache
 - Custom cache which will bypass cache for login page
 - Custom cache with cache everything directive will help speed up shared\hosted sites as it will cache HTML
  - Respect all existing headers
  - Match browser browser cache TTL in W3 Total Cache eg 1 hour
 - You can add new rules for a specific page
