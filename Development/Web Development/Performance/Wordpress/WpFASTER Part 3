                    Course Notes Part 3


                    Section 5  - Caching
1 - Caching: Prefatory Remarks 
Wordpress has multiple ways to cache sites
W3TotalCache Plugin is recommended - https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/
If issues are experienced upon installation it can be an indicator of needing a new host
Always have a backup of the site


2 - Page Caching How-To + Troubleshooting 
Read the installation instruction!!!
Plugin install via the usual plugin install method
Performance -> Settings will bring up screen
You may want to enable preview mode
Enable Page cache, disk enhanced if possible as the method
If after enabling your site is slower use disk basic method
Virtual Server settings not the best option for caching pages
Performance -> Page Cache
General Section
 - Check cache posts page
 - Cache front page
 - Cache feeds etc
 - Cache ssl
 - Cachng 404 pages will depend on the size of site
 - Dont cache for logged in users
 - Dont cache pages for certain user roles
Cache Preload Section
 - Leave the section blank
Cache Page Purge Policy
 - Leave defaults in place until site is running and then fine tune
Sitemaps
 - Leave defaults in place
Advanced
 - Fragment caching is paid for(not that big a performance boost)
 - Enable compatibility mode (may cause performance decrease)
 - Don't mess with UTF encoding
 - Garbage collection interval will depend on the site
 - Comment cookie lifetime as low as possible
 - Don't cache checkout pages
 

3 - Browser Caching (+ Headers Optimization) How-To + Troubleshooting 
Performance -> General Settings -> Browser Cache
Again enable Preview Mode
Performance -> Browser Cache
General 
 - E-Tag is checked
 - Set Expires Header is checked
 - Total Cache header is security risk
 - Enable HTTP (GZip) compression
CSS & JS
 - Set Expires Header is checked (make a very long time eg 1 year in seconds)
 - Cache control policy is not checked but if checked has a list of options
 - Enable HTTP(GZip) compression (Can be disabled during troubleshooting)
 - Disable cookies for static files
HTML & XML
 - Set Expires Header is checked (number matches page cache garbage collection removal) (also different from previous option)
 - Entity(E)-Tag is checked
Media & Other Files
 - Set Expires Header is checked (make a very long time eg 1 year in seconds)
 - Entity(E)-Tag is checked
 - Enable HTTP (GZip) compression
 - Disable cookies for static files
 
Gzip - Not that efficient for image compression


4 - Database & Object Caching How-To + Troubleshooting 
Particularly helpful for dynamic sites
Performance -> General Settings -> Database Cache
Enable Database cache
Different methods of DB caching available
  -> If available Opcode APC -- Alternative PHP Cache should be used (May need to be installed on the server)
  *** - May not be available on shared hosting
Enable Object Cache
 -> If available Opcode APC -- Alternative PHP Cache should be used (May need to be installed on the server)
  *** - May not be available on shared hosting
Try these one at a time and then both to test performance levels

Go then to the side menu -> Database Cache
 - Dont cache queries for logged in users
 - Garbage collection interval set to 2 hours (7200)
 - Match it with maximum lifetime of objects
 - You can never cache particular pages
 - You can ignore query stems and particular query words
 
Go then to the side menu -> Object Cache
 - Garbage collection interval set to 2 hours (7200)
 - Match it with maximum lifetime of objects
 - If using WP is network mode you can set groups 

Object cache can cause issues and is only really helpful for very dynamic sites
