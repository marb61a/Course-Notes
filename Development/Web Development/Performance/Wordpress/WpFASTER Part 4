                    Course Notes Part 4


                    Section 6 â€“ Minification & Concatenation I
1 - Minification & Concatenation: Prefatory Remarks 
This is likely to be an area where you will have problems
Be patient with troubleshooting
Less means more when it comes to speed


2 - Minification & Concatenation How-To 
General Settings-> Minify
Ensure minify is not enabled
Not usings W3Total Cache here due to dependency issues
Autoptimize - https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/
Access via settings or via plugins
-> Advanced Settings
HTML, CSS & JS settings available
Incognito recommended to use when doing optimisations
A quick run through of source code
HTML Options
 - Optimise HTML Code
 - You may need to keep some comments for adsense
 - Empty caches including WP3caches and then hard refresh the page in order for changes to be seen

CSS Options
 - Optimise CSS
 - Empty caches including WP3caches and then hard refresh the page in order for changes to be seen
 - CSS files will be concatenated and minified

JS Options
 - Optimise JS
 - Empty caches including WP3caches and then hard refresh the page in order for changes to be seen
 - JS files will be concatenated and minified
 
Always continue checking your site is working each time you make a change
Autoptimise automatically adds a non-blocking attribute to your files
There will be instances of forcing JS into the HEAD especially JQuery rather than at the BODY end
You can optimise to look only in the HEAD for scripts
Try\Catch wrapping is for script errors


3 - Troubleshooting Minification & Concatenation 
Troubleshooting of common problems
JS minification & concatention is likely to be a source of issues
JQuery is 99% likely to be the problem due to dependency issues
Depending on the site you may need to exclude JQuery scripts from minification and concatenation
You may also by elimination exclude other scripts as JQuery exclusion itself may not fix issues
You can also exclude individual stylesheets
Some plugins & themes may need to be changed as they cannot be minified or concatenated which will have affects on
other parts such as render blocking
Performance is more important that pretty
Defer attribute is nor recognised by all browsers

                    Section 7 - Minification & Concatenation II: The Render Blocking CSS & JavaScript Conundrum
1 - How to Eliminate Render Blocking CSS in Above-the-Fold Content: Part I 
Inline and Defer CSS
 - Inline above the fold CSS
 - Loads the main Autoptimised CSS only after page load
There is a box for passing above the fold CSS
Critical CSS Path Generator tool available at the following URL
 - https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/
Entering the URL of the minified CSS file in the tool with generate the critical CSS
Paste the generated CSS into the text box
Remember to clear all caches after saving
Tests show that the render blocking has been eliminated
Again JQuery may cause issues
FOUC - Flash Of Unstyled Content
You may want different settings for other pages on the site if you have different styling on them

 
2 - BONUS: Adjunct to Part I: Different Inline CSS on Different Pages/Posts How-To 
Starts of with unminified CSS
Visual Composer allows custom css settings
Visual Composer - https://vc.wpbakery.com
You can add Critical Path CSS and add to HEAD elements
Create the Critical Path CSS for each page
Using Visual Composer add Critical Path CSS for each page
There is no easy code free way of doing this
May suit smaller sites better
There is a plugin available for people without Visual Composer
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-add-custom-css/ - WpAddCustomCSS
Remember you may need to leave inline and defer CSS unchecked in Autoptimise


3 - How to Eliminate Render Blocking CSS in Above-the-Fold Content: Part II 
Inlining all CSS is a way of eliminating render blocking CSS
This is normally on used on sites with low numbers of page views
Large numbers of page views will cause a performance hit
Inline and defer is usually the best combination
Magic number for page weight range is 50 - 60 kb
Page weights should not exceed this weight


4 - How to Ideally Eliminate Render Blocking JavaScript in Above-the-Fold Content 
Slight difference between async and defer
 - Defer means that JS is not applied by the browser until all HTML is rendered
 - Async will apply file when ready
Using Async in conjunction with defer will improve page speed immensely
Async can be added to the Autoptimize
You will need to be able to add a code snippet to
 ->Theme Functions in functions.php
