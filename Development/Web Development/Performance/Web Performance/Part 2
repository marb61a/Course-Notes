                    Web Performance
                    Course Notes Part 2


Section 2 - JavaScript Performance
1 - The Cost of JavaScript
  - There is a problem on the client-side
    - You cannot buy servers to improve client-side performance
    - There is a lot of time spent compressing assets, removing requests and reducing latency
      - This does not tackle the prolem of when the app is running
  - Sometimes parsing and compiling is the culprit
  - The amount of JavaScript involved is growing at a large rate especially on mobile
    - Javascript is a compiled language
    - Most browsers just-in-time (JIT) compilation
    - There are things that are needed to be known about JIT
      - It means that there is compilation step
      - It means that it happens moments before execution
      - That means it happens on our clientâ€™s machine
      - This also means that they are paying the cost and/or doing the hard work
