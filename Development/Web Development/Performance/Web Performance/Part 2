                    Web Performance
                    Course Notes Part 2


Section 2 - JavaScript Performance
1 - The Cost of JavaScript
  - There is a problem on the client-side
    - You cannot buy servers to improve client-side performance
    - There is a lot of time spent compressing assets, removing requests and reducing latency
      - This does not tackle the prolem of when the app is running
  - Sometimes parsing and compiling is the culprit
  - The amount of JavaScript involved is growing at a large rate especially on mobile
    - Javascript is a compiled language
    - Most browsers just-in-time (JIT) compilation
    - There are things that are needed to be known about JIT
      - It means that there is compilation step
      - It means that it happens moments before execution
      - That means it happens on our clientâ€™s machine
      - This also means that they are paying the cost and/or doing the hard work

2 - Parsing
  - The source code is the true intention of the application
    - The engine though still has to figure out what this means
  - Parsing is slow and can take time
    - On mobile devices it can be as slow as 1MB/s
  - One way to reduce parsing time is to reduce the code that needs to be parsed
  - Another way is to do only as much parsing as needed
    - This can translate into parsing as little as can be gotten away with
  - Parsing happens in 2 phases
    - Eager Parsing (Full Parse)
      - This is what most people think of when thinking about parsing
    - Lazy Parse (Pre-parse)
      - This is where a minimum level of parsing is done initially and then fully later
  - On a general level Lazy Parsing can be a good thing
  - The basic rules of parsing (Lazy)
    - Scan through the top level scope
      - Parse all the code that can be seen to be doing something
    - Items such as class declarations can be skipped
      - They can be parsed as and when they are needed
  - There can be issues when doing lazy pasrsing
    - Depending on code structure code could end up being both lazy and eager parsed
    - This is very poor pratice as doing things twice is slower than doing it once
