                    BIND and DNS 
                    Course Notes Part 3


                    Section 5 - Basic Name Server Setup
1 - Get Ready
Some information on the examples that will be used through the rest of the course
  - The examples will be used are fictitious and are put together in a sandbox
  - These are not examples that should be used on your company network
  - Understand that adminsistering a name server may not be a viable option for the company
    - You will need to ensure that there is full buy in from stakeholders
    - If there is a security team they will need to be involved heavily
  - Everything is a trade off
  - The examples used are as close to real world as possible
    - Being a part of an example is not an endorsement of any kind
    - In order for there to be examples there had to be some providers chosen
    - Always do your own search and research
  - In order to follow along with the lab there are a few prerequisites
    - You will need to have a registered domain name
      - You can make use of free domain names that are available on the internet for testing purposes
    - You will need a web hosting provider
      - There are many different choices available for this purpose
    - You will also need to have an e-mail hosting provider
      - Like the example above there are a wealth of choices available
      - You will need to choose one which allows you to use your domain and set your routings
    - You will also need to have a secondary DNS provider
      - You do not always want to run a slave server on-premises
    - You will also need shell access on an external computer
      - This will give the ability to test as if you were an outsider
      - For example querying your own name server from outside your network
  - There are a couple of things to be kept in mind when building the lab
    - Security, make sure that you perform a risk analysis
    - Security, discuss options with your security person
    - Security, do more research!!!!!!

2 - Create And Verify The Zone File

3 - Load And Test The Zone File

4 - Allow Queries From Localnets

5 - Reverse Zone File

6 - External Zone File

                    
                    
                    Section 6 - Advanced Name Server Setup
1 - Configure a Secondary Name Server  

2 - Register A Name Server

3 - Updating Zones

4 - Serve A Website

5 - Third Party Email Server Setup

6 - MX and SPF Records For Email
                    
                    
                    Section 7 - Security Concerns
1 - TSIG
Due to the nature of DNS information is usually sent in the clear
  - A man in the middle attack is possible
  - Hijacking of resources can occur
The solution to some of these problems is called TSIG
  - Transaction SIGnatures
    - TSIG ensures data integrity and authentication
    - It is lightweight and flexible for secure communications between name servers
    - Its standard can be found at RFC 2845
    - It uses a single shared secret key
    - Keys need to be securely distributed
    - Keys can be generated using a utility called dnssec-keygen
Example Key Generation 
  - mkdir var/named/keys
  - cd var/named/keys
  - dnssec-keygen -a hmac-md5 -b 128 -C -n host tinjaw.site
    - The -a is for the algoritm which is hmac-md5
    - The -b is for how big the key size, in the example 128 bits

2 - RNDC

3 - DNSSEC
TSIG may not be good enough
  - It uses a single shared secret
  - One key is used on all servers for convenience which means the network is vulnerable
  - Separate keys for admins may improve security but are unwieldy 
  - There is no mechanism for definitively stating a host does not exist
DNSSEC
  - DNS Security Extensions
  - Used on large networks used by large corporations usually
  - Maybe useful on small networks that need high security
  - Some records that will be seen are DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, DS
  - They are described in standards -> RFC's 4033, 4034 and 4035
  - There is a trade off as greater security needs greater resources

                    
                    
                    Section 8 - Conclusion
