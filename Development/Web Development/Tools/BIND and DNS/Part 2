                    BIND and DNS 
                    Course Notes Part 2


                    Section 4 - Zone Configuration File
1 - Zone Config Files
Zone files are plain text files 
They describe what is in a DNS zone
The chapter will be explaining each section of a zone file
  - There is a sample zone file included as part of the course

2 - TTL
The $TTL or Time To Live field is usually the first one in a zone file
It sets the default TTL for the zone
It can be overridden
The values in TTL are in seconds
  - The maximum value allowed works out at about 68 years
  - You should work with more reasonable values eg 2400000 equals about 4 weeks
  - A minimum should be 86400 which is 1 day
When the duration of a TTL has passed it is no longer considered valid
  - If you cannot get an answer after 4 weeks you should assume that the record is inaacurate
Syntax
  $TTL num_of_seconds eg $TTL 2400000
Bind V9 will not load a zone without a valid TTL
An example of when to use smaller values is when planning changes to a network
  - If you change an IP address it may take a long time to propogate with a larger TTL
  - If a change is imminent you may wish to put the change as low as 12 hours or $TTL 43200;
Overiding the values can be done and the specification for dooing so is in RFC2038
  - Bind has its own syntax that makes things much easier
    - It will accept durations other than seconds
      - m for minutes
      - h for hours
      - d for days
      - w for weeks
    - Instead of 86400 you can use 1d, 48h for 48 hours, you can combine 1h 30m for 90 minutes

3 - ORIGIN
$ORIGIN value
  - The value appended to names without a trailing dot
  - It is meant to clean up a zone file and make it easier to read
$ORIGIN example.com.
  - Any records in the lines following this without an ending dot will have example.com. appended to it
  - Therefore ftp IN CNAME server1 becomes
    - ftp.example.com. IN CNAME server1.example.com.
Entries that end in a dot are called Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN's)
  - ftp.example.org. is an FQDN but ftp.example.org is not

4 - SOA
SOA - Start Of Authority which is the most important entry in a zone file
  - This record can be quite complex and is often quite long
  - The @ sign is used as a substitute for the current $origin
The SOA will look like
  $86400                // Often not set as uses the previously set default
  $ORIGIN example.com.
  @ IN SOA nameserver.example.com . emailadmin.example.com. (
    // The serial number can be anything between 0 and over 4 billion
    // Convention dictates that you use yyyymmddss as the basis for your serial
    // The last 2 numbers can be incremented for version or revisions, you always start low and increment
              2015081703; serial 
              
              21600;                 // Refresh value which is set to 6 hours here, This is the time
                                     // Taken by the slave server to check with the master for zone modifications
              
              3600;                  // Retry interval which is the intervals which will be used by a slave if it is
                                     // unable to contact the master server to check for zone modification
                                     
              604800;                // The slave will continue trying to contact the master until the expiry time is 
                                     // reached, in this case a week, if this value is reached the slave will give up
                                     // and stop responding to queries
              
              86400                  // The negative response TTL value is used when a resolver requests to resolve a
                                     // host name but the name server cannot resolve it because it does not exist then
                                     // it will receive an NX domain error from the server, the resolver will then return
                                     // this value for the duration of the NX value which can be from 0 - 3 hours
  );

5 - NS
Second only to the previous in importance is the NS Resource Record
  - Its purpose is to define the authoritative name server(s)
  - They are defined in RFC1035
NS Resource Record Syntax
  name                              // Can be explicitly stated but is often taken from the SOA record, it is the zone record
  ttl                               // This is a standard ttl for this record should you override the zone default
  class                             // Almost always IN which defines it as the internet
  NS                                // 
  name                              // This is the name of the name server usually a FQDN
