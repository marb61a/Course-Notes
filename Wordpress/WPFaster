1 - Website Speed: How Much it Matters & Why "Fast Enough" Isn't 
Quick introduction to the instructor
Google gives tools away to help optimization
Preloading(pre-rendering) - The loading of a webpage prior to clicking its listing in anticipation of you doing it
Google - 500 millisecond slowdown = 20% reduction in ad revenue
Bing - 2 seconds of increased load time = 2.5% reduction in queries and clicks
Amazon - 100 miliseconds of slowdown = 1% decrease in revenue
Yahoo - 400 milllisecond improvement = 9% traffic increase
Bottom line slow sites will cost business
Speed is critical to your success

More people are using mobile devices to surf sites
Latency is one of two primary elements that determines how your site performs on mobil\tablet devices
The second element is bandwidth
Latency refers to several types of delays
Excessive latency causes bottlenecks

                    Section 2 – The WpFASTER WordPress Speed/Performance Optimization Foundation
1 - Hosting Primer 
Host is where your site lives
Not recommended - specialty, managed WP hosting for 3 reasons
 - Configuration Limitation
 - Access Limitation
 - Support Limitation
Principles of good hosting
 - Can have access and do whatever you want
Shared hosts not recommended either
VPS is the recommended as the best option for hosting


2 - Compression Primer 
In this context it is the GZip compression of text based assets eg Javascript, HTML, CSS
Zip compresses resources making them smaller which makes the site faster
GZip is not context specific
GZip makes information smaller without changing the meaning


3 - Minification (& Concatenation) Primer 
Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from source code without affecting the functionality
Characters include whitespace etc
Minification is context specific
Minification is linked with concatenation eg concatenating 5 minified css files into 1


4 - Reducing HTTP Requests Primer 
HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
A HTTP request is when a browser requests a file
HTTP is a request and response protocol
Javascript and CSS block site rendering
Fewer JS\CSS HTTP requests will make the site faster
Less images and smaller versions will also make the site faster


5 - Image Optimization Primer 
Every image constitutes a HTTP request
Optimising images can yield some of the greatest performance improvements
With image optimisation, information can be removed, eliminated or changed in a way text based information cant be
2 methods of image optimisation
 - Lossy which removes pixels
 - Lossless no pixels removed
Both methods strip out metadata(properties, resolution etc)


6 - Eliminating Render-Blocking JavaScript & CSS in 'Above-the-Fold' Content Primer 
JS and CSS block rendering
Above the fold comes from print media mainly newspaper
Anything below the fold can wait


7 - Asynchronous Resources Primer 
An aysynchronous resource is one that loads such that it doesnt block page rendering
Optimising the Critical Rendering Path means optimising everything needed to render above the fold content


8 - Caching Primer 
Caching is recommended as the number 1 optimising tip
Caching is used
 - Reduces latency by using the cache instead of making full request
 - Reduces network traffic
Caching types
 - Page Caching
 - Browser Caching
 - Database & Object Caching

                     Section 3 – Testing the Efficacy of Your Optimizations
1 - Prefatory Remarks on Website Speed Testing Tools & Metrics (Performance Data) 
What we need to know now
 - Are the optimizations working as we thought that they would
 - How do we know whether they are or are not
** Without accurate metrics its all guesswork
An inaccurate tool can in some circumstances still be accurate
Synthetic Tool
 - Cannot give the most accurate metrics but is still helpful when it is and for the reasons it is
Organic Tools
 - Can give us the most accurate metics but may not help in the same way a synthetic tool can
 

2 - Pingdom: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://tools.pingdom.com
FPT - Full Page Test
A combination of synthetic and organic tool
Easy to use you just have to enter a url

Millions of users so comparisons are done with a large set of sites


3 - GTmetrix: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://gtmetrix.com
Pro Version available with options available on test server location
Similar to Pingdom 
Recommendations for improvements are are part of results

Videos tend not to be counted in metrics
Critical render path again is not evident
