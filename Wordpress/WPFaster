                    Official WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course                  

                    Section 1 - Introduction to the Official WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course
1 - Website Speed: How Much it Matters & Why "Fast Enough" Isn't 
Quick introduction to the instructor
Google gives tools away to help optimization
Preloading(pre-rendering) - The loading of a webpage prior to clicking its listing in anticipation of you doing it
Google - 500 millisecond slowdown = 20% reduction in ad revenue
Bing - 2 seconds of increased load time = 2.5% reduction in queries and clicks
Amazon - 100 miliseconds of slowdown = 1% decrease in revenue
Yahoo - 400 milllisecond improvement = 9% traffic increase
Bottom line slow sites will cost business
Speed is critical to your success


2 - Course Syllabus 
PDF detailing syllabus covered by the course


3 - How to Take the Course
Tips on how best the student should approach the course
 - Doing it and practicing will help you learn more
 - Practice on a test site
 - Use proper computer
 

4 - What the Course Is (& Is Not) 
The course is primarily a course covering
 - WPO - Web Performance Optimization
 - FEO - Front End Optimization course
 - UX - User Experience
SEO optimisation is not covered


5 - Remarks on Optimizing for Mobiles/Tablets (I.e. "High Latency" Devices) 
More people are using mobile devices to surf sites
Latency is one of two primary elements that determines how your site performs on mobil\tablet devices
The second element is bandwidth
Latency refers to several types of delays
Excessive latency causes bottlenecks
WPTouch is recommended as the best mobile plugin to decrease latency for people navigating to your site
There is a pro version of WpTouch available and a manual is available and should be read


6 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 1 
Text file for additional material
Google is “obsessed" with speed.
Optimization is a PROCESS not an EVENT, and when it comes to website speed there is no such thing as "Fast Enough".



                    Section 2 – The WpFASTER WordPress Speed/Performance Optimization Foundation
1 - Hosting Primer 
Host is where your site lives
Not recommended - specialty, managed WP hosting for 3 reasons
 - Configuration Limitation
 - Access Limitation
 - Support Limitation
Principles of good hosting
 - Can have access and do whatever you want
Shared hosts not recommended either
VPS is the recommended as the best option for hosting


2 - Compression Primer 
In this context it is the GZip compression of text based assets eg Javascript, HTML, CSS
Zip compresses resources making them smaller which makes the site faster
GZip is not context specific
GZip makes information smaller without changing the meaning


3 - Minification (& Concatenation) Primer 
Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from source code without affecting the functionality
Characters include whitespace etc
Minification is context specific
Minification is linked with concatenation eg concatenating 5 minified css files into 1


4 - Reducing HTTP Requests Primer 
HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
A HTTP request is when a browser requests a file
HTTP is a request and response protocol
Javascript and CSS block site rendering
Fewer JS\CSS HTTP requests will make the site faster
Less images and smaller versions will also make the site faster


5 - Image Optimization Primer 
Every image constitutes a HTTP request
Optimising images can yield some of the greatest performance improvements
With image optimisation, information can be removed, eliminated or changed in a way text based information cant be
2 methods of image optimisation
 - Lossy which removes pixels
 - Lossless no pixels removed
Both methods strip out metadata(properties, resolution etc)


6 - Eliminating Render-Blocking JavaScript & CSS in 'Above-the-Fold' Content Primer 
JS and CSS block rendering
Above the fold comes from print media mainly newspaper
Anything below the fold can wait


7 - Asynchronous Resources Primer 
An aysynchronous resource is one that loads such that it doesnt block page rendering
Optimising the Critical Rendering Path means optimising everything needed to render above the fold content


8 - Caching Primer 
Caching is recommended as the number 1 optimising tip
Caching is used
 - Reduces latency by using the cache instead of making full request
 - Reduces network traffic
Caching types
 - Page Caching
 - Browser Caching
 - Database & Object Caching
 

9 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 2 



                     Section 3 – Testing the Efficacy of Your Optimizations
1 - Prefatory Remarks on Website Speed Testing Tools & Metrics (Performance Data) 
What we need to know now
 - Are the optimizations working as we thought that they would
 - How do we know whether they are or are not
** Without accurate metrics its all guesswork
An inaccurate tool can in some circumstances still be accurate
Synthetic Tool
 - Cannot give the most accurate metrics but is still helpful when it is and for the reasons it is
Organic Tools
 - Can give us the most accurate metics but may not help in the same way a synthetic tool can
 

2 - Pingdom: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://tools.pingdom.com
FPT - Full Page Test
A combination of synthetic and organic tool
Easy to use you just have to enter a url
Load time is innaccurate due to it indicating total page and assets load time
Millions of users so comparisons are done with a large set of sites


3 - GTmetrix: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://gtmetrix.com
Pro Version available with options available on test server location
Similar to Pingdom 
Recommendations for improvements are are part of results
Average grade for sites is 80%
Total page size is synthetic and inaccurate
Videos tend not to be counted in metrics
Critical render path again is not evident
YSlow - Yahoo Speed test -- http://yslow.org


4 - Google's PageSpeed Insights: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/
Mobile Friendly test also available
Recommendations for improvements are are part of results
User experience grade is part of test
Instructions on how to fix errors are available
Google places great emphasis on speed


5 - WebPageTest: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://www.webpagetest.org
Gives actual and actionable metrics
You can choose from multiple locations and also multiple browsers
You are able to introduce real world scenarios eg DSL, Wireless etc
9 tests are the minimum number that should be run
Video can be captured by a test
Tests can be kept private
In the documentation is an instruction on how to interperet results
Multiple metrics available eg First Byte to help understand critical render path
Results shown are median
Speed index test is testing relative to other sites
You should aim to be in the top 20% which is elite level
DOM content & Start Render should be as quick as possible

                    Section 4 Recap & Remarks On Optimizing Your WordPress Site's 'Core'
1 - Sections 1 - 3 Recap & Prefatory Remarks on 'Core' Optimization 



                    Section 5  - Caching
1 - Caching: Prefatory Remarks 
Wordpress has multiple ways to cache sites
W3TotalCache Plugin is recommended - https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/
If issues are experienced upon installation it can be an indicator of needing a new host
Always have a backup of the site


2 - Page Caching How-To + Troubleshooting 
Read the installation instruction!!!
Plugin install via the usual plugin install method
Performance -> Settings will bring up screen
You may want to enable preview mode
Enable Page cache, disk enhanced if possible as the method
If after enabling your site is slower use disk basic method
Virtual Server settings not the best option for caching pages
Performance -> Page Cache
General Section
 - Check cache posts page
 - Cache front page
 - Cache feeds etc
 - Cache ssl
 - Cachng 404 pages will depend on the size of site
 - Dont cache for logged in users
 - Dont cache pages for certain user roles
Cache Preload Section
 - Leave the section blank
Cache Page Purge Policy
 - Leave defaults in place until site is running and then fine tune
Sitemaps
 - Leave defaults in place
Advanced
 - Fragment caching is paid for(not that big a performance boost)
 - Enable compatibility mode (may cause performance decrease)
 - Don't mess with UTF encoding
 - Garbage collection interval will depend on the site
 - Comment cookie lifetime as low as possible
 - Don't cache checkout pages
 

3 - Browser Caching (+ Headers Optimization) How-To + Troubleshooting 
Performance -> General Settings -> Browser Cache
Again enable Preview Mode
Performance -> Browser Cache
General 
 - E-Tag is checked
 - Set Expires Header is checked
 - Total Cache header is security risk
 - Enable HTTP (GZip) compression
CSS & JS
 - Set Expires Header is checked (make a very long time eg 1 year in seconds)
 - Cache control policy is not checked but if checked has a list of options
 - Enable HTTP(GZip) compression (Can be disabled during troubleshooting)
 - Disable cookies for static files
HTML & XML
 - Set Expires Header is checked (number matches page cache garbage collection removal) (also different from previous option)
 - Entity(E)-Tag is checked
Media & Other Files
 - Set Expires Header is checked (make a very long time eg 1 year in seconds)
 - Entity(E)-Tag is checked
 - Enable HTTP (GZip) compression
 - Disable cookies for static files
 
Gzip - Not that efficient for image compression


4 - Database & Object Caching How-To + Troubleshooting 
Particularly helpful for dynamic sites
Performance -> General Settings -> Database Cache
Enable Database cache
Different methods of DB caching available
  -> If available Opcode APC -- Alternative PHP Cache should be used (May need to be installed on the server)
  *** - May not be available on shared hosting
Enable Object Cache
 -> If available Opcode APC -- Alternative PHP Cache should be used (May need to be installed on the server)
  *** - May not be available on shared hosting
Try these one at a time and then both to test performance levels

Go then to the side menu -> Database Cache
 - Dont cache queries for logged in users
 - Garbage collection interval set to 2 hours (7200)
 - Match it with maximum lifetime of objects
 - You can never cache particular pages
 - You can ignore query stems and particular query words
 
Go then to the side menu -> Object Cache
 - Garbage collection interval set to 2 hours (7200)
 - Match it with maximum lifetime of objects
 - If using WP is network mode you can set groups 

Object cache can cause issues and is only really helpful for very dynamic sites

                    Sectionn 6 – Minification & Concatenation I
1 - Minification & Concatenation: Prefatory Remarks 
This is likely to be an area where you will have problems
Be patient with troubleshooting
Less means more when it comes to speed


2 - Minification & Concatenation How-To 
General Settings-> Minify
Ensure minify is not enabled
Not usings W3Total Cache here due to dependency issues
Autoptimize - https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/
Access via settings or via plugins
-> Advanced Settings
HTML, CSS & JS settings available
Incognito recommended to use when doing optimisations
A quick run through of source code
HTML Options
 - Optimise HTML Code
 - You may need to keep some comments for adsense
 - Empty caches including WP3caches and then hard refresh the page in order for changes to be seen

CSS Options
 - Optimise CSS
 - Empty caches including WP3caches and then hard refresh the page in order for changes to be seen
 - CSS files will be concatenated and minified

JS Options
 - Optimise JS
 - Empty caches including WP3caches and then hard refresh the page in order for changes to be seen
 - JS files will be concatenated and minified
 
Always continue checking your site is working each time you make a change
Autoptimise automatically adds a non-blocking attribute to your files
There will be instances of forcing JS into the HEAD especially JQuery rather than at the BODY end
You can optimise to look only in the HEAD for scripts
Try\Catch wrapping is for script errors


3 - Troubleshooting Minification & Concatenation 
Troubleshooting of common problems
JS minification & concatention is likely to be a source of issues
JQuery is 99% likely to be the problem due to dependency issues
Depending on the site you may need to exclude JQuery scripts from minification and concatenation
You may also by elimination exclude other scripts as JQuery exclusion itself may not fix issues
You can also exclude individual stylesheets
Some plugins & themes may need to be changed as they cannot be minified or concatenated which will have affects on
other parts such as render blocking
Performance is more important that pretty
Defer attribute is nor recognised by all browsers


4 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 6 



                    Section 7 - Minification & Concatenation II: The Render Blocking CSS & JavaScript Conundrum
1 - How to Eliminate Render Blocking CSS in Above-the-Fold Content: Part I 
Inline and Defer CSS
 - Inline above the fold CSS
 - Loads the main Autoptimised CSS only after page load
There is a box for passing above the fold CSS
Critical CSS Path Generator tool available at the following URL
 - https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/
Entering the URL of the minified CSS file in the tool with generate the critical CSS
Paste the generated CSS into the text box
Remember to clear all caches after saving
Tests show that the render blocking has been eliminated
Again JQuery may cause issues
FOUC - Flash Of Unstyled Content
You may want different settings for other pages on the site if you have different styling on them

 
2 - BONUS: Adjunct to Part I: Different Inline CSS on Different Pages/Posts How-To 
Starts of with unminified CSS
Visual Composer allows custom css settings
Visual Composer - https://vc.wpbakery.com
You can add Critical Path CSS and add to HEAD elements
Create the Critical Path CSS for each page
Using Visual Composer add Critical Path CSS for each page
There is no easy code free way of doing this
May suit smaller sites better
There is a plugin available for people without Visual Composer
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-add-custom-css/ - WpAddCustomCSS
Remember you may need to leave inline and defer CSS unchecked in Autoptimise


3 - How to Eliminate Render Blocking CSS in Above-the-Fold Content: Part II 
Inlining all CSS is a way of eliminating render blocking CSS
This is normally on used on sites with low numbers of page views
Large numbers of page views will cause a performance hit
Inline and defer is usually the best combination
Magic number for page weight range is 50 - 60 kb
Page weights should not exceed this weight


4 - How to Ideally Eliminate Render Blocking JavaScript in Above-the-Fold Content 
Slight difference between async and defer
 - Defer means that JS is not applied by the browser until all HTML is rendered
 - Async will apply file when ready
Using Async in conjunction with defer will improve page speed immensely
Async can be added to the Autoptimize
You will need to be able to add a code snippet to
 ->Theme Functions in functions.php


5 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 7 



                    Section 8 - Image Optimization
1 - Image Optimization How-To 
Recommended plugin EWWW Image Optimiser - https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/
No compatability issues found thus far
Easy to use & is installed the trditional WP way
Go to -> Settings -> EWWW Image Optimiser
Settings will need to be tested for each site
Having a proper host will again impact
Image heavy sites will need to utilise Cloud Optimisation(Needs a key)
Remove all image metadata eg EXIF -- Recommended by the instructor
Optipng will need to be tuned for individual site
Automatic Optimisation is enabled and author recommends not disabling it
Disable pngout
-> Conversion Settings
 - If you have space do not delete original images
 - Enable gif to png conversions


2 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 8 



                    Section 9 - Lazy Loading
1 - Lazy Loading (Images, Thumbnails, Gravatars, iframes & Widgets) How-To 
Lazy loading content is not loaded until user scrolls to it
Lazy loading can be used with images etc
Plugin recommended is BJ Lazyload - https://wordpress.org/plugins/bj-lazy-load/
Again some settings will be dependent on the individual site
Go To -> Settings -> BJ Lazy Load Options
Load file in the footer rather than the head
Apply to to
 - Content
 - Text Widgets
 - Post Thumbnails
 - Gravatars
 - Images
 - IFrames
Can cut page weight in half
Place holder image URL is better left blank
Skip Images with Classes will be used mainly with specific images
Threshold is set in pixels eg 200 which is the default
If theme uses Infinite Scroll then tick box
Lazy loading can hinder performance on some sites


2 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 9 



                    Section 10 - Advanced WordPress Optimizations: A Taste of the WpFASTER Secret Sauce
1 - Prefatory Remarks About Advanced Optimizations 
Site should be quicker than 60 - 70% of all sites
Introduction to what the section will cover


2 - Plugin Organization & Prioritization 
Also known as Selective Plugin Loading
Plugin available but can be done in code
Plugin Organizer - https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-organizer/
Go to Plugin Organizer -> Settings
Fuzzy Url Matching - Gives any URL the ability to affect children of that URL
Ignore URL Protocol - This allows you to ignore the protocol of a URL (HTTP, HTTPS) when trying to match it in the DB at load time
Ignore URL Arguments - This allows you to ignore the arguments of a URL
Selective Plugin Loading - Recommended to be switched on
You can optimise plugin loading for mobile sites too
Admin CSS - Set CSS colours
Mobile User Agents - Pre-populated by list of devices
MU plugins -  Must Use plugins
You may need to get into hosting settings
You can set appropriate plugins for pages and posts
You can manually adjust plugin load order
Using plugins only on certain pages can have a big efect on page weight


3 - Browser Hinting 
Suggesting that the browser should do things not normally done
There are many different types of hints
Pre-Fretching - Firefox \ Pre-Rendering - Chrome
Wordpress plugin used - Per Page Add To Head -- https://wordpress.org/plugins/per-page-add-to/
Go in the head of the page
Looks like - rel="prerender"
Allows for the elimination of the perception of latency
It allows for a probable next page in customer journey to be pre-loaded
You must know your customers likely journey
Can be resource heavy
Ensure that you use extensive testing

Tutorial on Browser Hinting available at 
 - https://scotch.io/tutorials/browser-resource-hinting-with-prefetch-preconnect-and-prerender


4 - PushState + AJAX (PJAX) 
PushState - Tutorial available -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API
AJAX - Tutorial available here -- https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp
PJAX - When someone hovers on a link, the page is loaded in the backgorund
Plugin used - Instant Click -- https://co.wordpress.org/plugins/instantclick/stats/ (Has not been updated)
Main website - http://instantclick.io
Preload on hover by default
May have difficulty if you have different JS from page to page
You will need to add these JS file links to custom JS section


5 - Cache Warming & Cron Jobs 
Uncached pages have impact on User Experience when landing on the page
Uncached pages can take 5 - 10 times longer to load
Cache Warming ensures that pages are cached reuglarly to avoid cold page loads
Plugin used is Warm Cache - https://wordpress.org/plugins/warm-cache/
Crawls pages based on XML site map
Once activated if sitemap is present it will populate automatically
You should have sitemap if not generate one and enter address to plugin
You will get an additional url for Cron Jobs 
Cron Jobs are scheduled jobs
If using a proper host setting up a cron job should be easy
CPanel has cron job section
Add to command curl warm cache url
Schedule according to server resources, if possible once every 5 minutes
A tutorial using WP plugin for cron is available at
 - http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-view-and-control-wordpress-cron-jobs/
A tutorial explaning more about Cron is available at 
 - http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html
If you have activated object cache in W3 Total Cache you may run into issues


6 - Domain Sharding 
Domain Sharding is a means to get browsers to do more than they normally would
It allows more parallelized downloads of assets
The first steps means setting up site sub-domains the you will shard resources off to eg 10 per sub-domain
Most hosts will allow sub-domains but the process will be host specific
No more than 2 sub-domains, more hurts performance
You want a CName record for your sub-domains
W3 Total Cache has a CDN feature which allows for adding CName for shards
DNS can take up to 4 hours to propogate
Test Mirror button will test shards are functioning properly
Dont shard CSS or JS, it will cause loading order problems in the browser


7 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 10 



                    Section 11 - 'Edge' Optimization: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
1 - Prefatory Remarks About Edge Optimization, CDNs & An Introduction to CloudFlare 
Site core should already optimized
Testing location distance can affect speed
CDN - Content Delivery Network
CDN - A network of servers strategically placed around the world, that delivers you site's cached content based
on the user's geographic location
CDN can help eliminate a latency
This is referred to as an edge optimisation as it will be at the outer end of your site
Cloudflare didn't start out as a CDN
 - It has a free plan
 - Provides benefits that other CDN dont
 - Cloudflare is better than most other CDN providers

2 - Installing CloudFlare 
Once you have signed up and logged in you will have a dashboard
You will need to use Cloudflare's DNS settings and change the DNS servers in your hosts to the Cloudflare DNS
Grey cloud icon means it is bypassing Cloudflare
You will usually get a notification to tell you when the propogation process is complete
