                    Course Notes Part 3


5.2 Describe Azure networking products
  - This section will use a shown demo app as an example for showcasing netoworking product options
    - The app itself uses the n-tier architecture
    - Most applications use this approach when designing applications
      - This is because it separates tiers
  - Some of the app tiers should not be in contact with one another directly
  - One of the ways to separate different tiers is to use Azure Virtual Networks
    - This will divide the tiers into different subnets
    - This approach will help secure network traffic
  - In order to support more users you may have to scale out an application
    - This can cause a problem using the previously mentioned subnet configuration
    - This is because a user might only be able to use a single subnet to access the internet
    - There may be  need to share out user load between available subnets
    - Using Azure Load Balancer will allow for spreading out user loads
  - Azure Application Gateway
    - This helps as the Azure Application Gateway understands HTTP
    - This does alot of the same as the load balancer but understands HTTP traffic
    - The web application firewall can also be added here to prevent intruders from getting in to the network
  - VPN Gateway Connections
    - S2S VPN -- Site 2 Site VPN
      - This connects VNet to a single on premises location
    - P2S VPN -- Point to Site VPN
      - Connects one on-premises client to the VNET
    - VNET to VNET
      - Connects 2 Azure VNET's to each other
   - Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    - Delivers large files or streaming over the internet
    - Caches files in multiple geographic locations
    - Stores files on a Point-of-Presence (POP) server
      - These servers are often called Edge Servers
    - The content on the Edge Servers has a Time-To-Live (TTL)
  - Azure Traffic Manager
    - The Azure Traffic Manager has many rules for traffic
      - Priority
      - Weighted
      - Performance
      - Geographic
      - Multivalue
      - Subnet
