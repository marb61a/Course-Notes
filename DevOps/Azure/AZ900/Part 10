  - Azure changes on a regular basis in many different ways
    - For example services are either updated or new services added
    - Feedback on these changes is of great interest to MS
      - This is why previes are available prior to general release
  - There are different types of preview
    - Private Preview -- This is provided with reduced or no SLA and at reduced cost
      - These previews are only made available to small numbers of customers
        - Often this is by invitation
      - There is frequently only a subset of features available
      - They are not always offered and are not fit for production use
    - Public Preview -- Which is open to all users
      - It is usually either fully or close to functional
      - It is usually made available for free or reduced priced and reduced SLA
      - It is also not fit for production use
