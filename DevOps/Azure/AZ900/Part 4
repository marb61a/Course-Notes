                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 4


  - Managed Instance
    - This is designed for what is called a lift and shift scenario
    - The Database Migration Service (DMS) is available to make migration easier
      - DMS requires either a VPN or a service such as ExpressRoute
        - ExpressRoute is a service that enables you to create private connections between Azure datacentres
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction
  - Azure Database for MySQL
    - This is a fully managed MySQL database as a service
    - There is pay as you go pricing
    - There are automatice backups
    - Enterprise security and compliance is applied
    - It can be scaled easily and quickly
    - Support commonly used open source tools
  - Azure CosmosDB
    - This a NoSQL database system offering many database API's
      - Core API -- Document database that can be queried using SQL
      - Azure Cosmos DB from Mongo API -- Migrating a Mongo DB to Cosmos DB
      - Cassandra -- Migrating a Cassandra DB to Cosmos DB
      - Azure Table -- Migrating data stored in Azure Table Storage to Cosmos DB
      - Gremlin -- Migrating a Gremlin DB to Cosmos DB

5.5 Describe Azure Marketplace
  - There are existing ARM templates on the Azure marketplace
    - These are both Microsoft and 3rd party templates
    - This will save work on making you own template
    - There are multiple categories available
    - Some of the templates combine a single source
      - Others deploy a solution with multiple sources
    - There are both paid and free



Lesson 6: Learn Some of the Solutions Available in Azure
6.1 Describe Internet of things
  - Azure has 2 offerings for managing IoT devices
  - Azure IoT Hub
    - This is a PaaS offering which is for managing communications between your applications and devices
    - It supports the secure handling of messages to and from devices
    - It supports virtually all IoT devices at scale
    - It enables easy management of devices
  - Azure IoT Central
    - It is SaaS for easier management of IoT devices
    - There are no Azure resources required
    - There is pay as you go available based on the number of devices
    - There are many templates available for applications

6.2 Describe big data and analytics
  - Azure has several offerings for Big Data that includes
    - Azure SQL Data Warehouse
      - This is designed for relational data
      - All the data stored is encrypted and secured
        - This is using 256 bit encryption
      - You can easily and quickly scale database instants which will help control costs
      - There are 2 performance tiers
        - Gen1 tier
          - This measure resources in SQL Warehouse Units (DWU's)
          - When scaling simply add or reduce DWU's
        - Gen2 tier
          - This measures resources in Compute Data Warehouse Units (CDWU's)
          - The difference is that Gen2 uses a local disk based cache, which is much more performant
    - Azure Data Lake Storage
      - This is not relational data
      - Data is stored in containers
      - There are 2 different modes for accessing data in Data Lake Storage
        - Object Based Mode
        - File based mode
        - Data Lake Sotrage allows for organising objects into a system of directories
        - These are very much like the directories on a PC
        - This allows for using both modes for analysing data
          - This is what MS calls multi-modal storage
          - Data Lake storage is the first cloud provider to offer this capability
      - This is not suitable for presenting data to people
        - Data is often moved to SQL Warehouse for presentation
      - Billing in this case is similar to Azure blob storage
    - Azure HD Insight
      - This is the MS implementation of Hadoop
        - https://hadoop.apache.org
      - HD Insight also supports other cluster types
        - HBase, Storm, Spark, Kafka, RServer, Interactive Query
      - It uses clustered computers called nodes for analytics
      - Customers are billed on a per hour basis

6.3 Describe artificial intelligence
  - There are 2 different types of AI
    - Weak AI or Artificial Narrow
    - Strong AI or Artificial General
    - The kind of AI most people think of is Strong AI
  - All of the AI currently used is Weak AI
  - AI uses a digital neural network
    - This is similar to the way a human brain works but in digital format
    - This takes an input performs an operation and delivers an output
  - There are many ways to process an input but the 2 most popular are
    - Natural Language Understanding
      - This refers to the ability of a computer to understand Human speech
    - Machine Learning
      - The most common use of Machine Learning is image processing and pattern recognition
    - All AI relies on Big Data
  - MS offers different services for AI
    - Azure Cognitive Services which covers 
      - Computer Vision
      - Microsoft Speech
      - Language Understanding Intelligent Service
      - Azure Search and Bing Search
    - Machine Language Frameworks
      - ONNX
      - Py-Kit
      - Tensorflow
      - Sci-Kit learn
  - Azure Databricks
    - They accumulate, organise and form data for an ML model
    - Data can be organised, visualised and documented in Notebooks
    - Databricks uses Databrick Runtime for ML
      - Other tools though can be used instead
    - Once a model is developed it can be exported
      - This is known as being Productionalised 
      - It can use MLeap or Databricks ML Model Export
