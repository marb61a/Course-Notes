                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 4


  - Managed Instance
    - This is designed for what is called a lift and shift scenario
    - The Database Migration Service (DMS) is available to make migration easier
      - DMS requires either a VPN or a service such as ExpressRoute
        - ExpressRoute is a service that enables you to create private connections between Azure datacentres
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction
  - Azure Database for MySQL
    - This is a fully managed MySQL database as a service
    - There is pay as you go pricing
    - There are automatice backups
    - Enterprise security and compliance is applied
    - It can be scaled easily and quickly
    - Support commonly used open source tools
  - Azure CosmosDB
    - This a NoSQL database system offering many database API's
      - Core API -- Document database that can be queried using SQL
      - Azure Cosmos DB from Mongo API -- Migrating a Mongo DB to Cosmos DB
      - Cassandra -- Migrating a Cassandra DB to Cosmos DB
      - Azure Table -- Migrating data stored in Azure Table Storage to Cosmos DB
      - Gremlin -- Migrating a Gremlin DB to Cosmos DB

5.5 Describe Azure Marketplace
  - There are existing ARM templates on the Azure marketplace
    - These are both Microsoft and 3rd party templates
    - This will save work on making you own template
    - There are multiple categories available
    - Some of the templates combine a single source
      - Others deploy a solution with multiple sources
    - There are both paid and free



Lesson 6: Learn Some of the Solutions Available in Azure
6.1 Describe Internet of things
  - Azure has 2 offerings for managing IoT devices
  - Azure IoT Hub
    - This is a PaaS offering which is for managing communications between your applications and devices
    - It supports the secure handling of messages to and from devices
    - It supports virtually all IoT devices at scale
    - It enables easy management of devices
  - Azure IoT Central
    - It is SaaS for easier management of IoT devices
    - There are no Azure resources required
    - There is pay as you go available based on the number of devices
    - There are many templates available for applications

6.2 Describe big data and analytics
  - Azure has several offerings for Big Data that includes
    - Azure SQL Data Warehouse
      - This is designed for relational data
      - All the data stored is encrypted and secured
        - This is using 256 bit encryption
      - You can easily and quickly scale database instants which will help control costs
      - There are 2 performance tiers
        - Gen1 tier
          - This measure resources in SQL Warehouse Units (DWU's)
          - When scaling simply add or reduce DWU's
        - Gen2 tier
          - This measures resources in Compute Data Warehouse Units (CDWU's)
          - The difference is that Gen2 uses a local disk based cache, which is much more performant
    - Azure Data Lake Storage
      - This is not relational data
      - Data is stored in containers
      - There are 2 different modes for accessing data in Data Lake Storage
        - Object Based Mode
        - File based mode
        - Data Lake Sotrage allows for organising objects into a system of directories
        - These are very much like the directories on a PC
      - It enables multi-modal storage
    - Azure HD Insight
