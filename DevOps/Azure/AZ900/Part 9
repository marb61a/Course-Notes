Lesson 17: Describe Azure Service Level Agreements
17.1 Understand service level agreement (SLA)
  - A service level agreement (SLA) will establish a target for resource availability
    - It will also address what a provider will when a target is not met
  - It is expressed as a percentage which is typically above 99%
  - The theoretical highest SLA is 99.999% which is called 5 nines
  - The usual SLA is 99.9%
  - There is service outside of a SLA but that is conditional
    - It is when the impact is caused by something in the providers control
  - If the service falls outside of the SLA then there is a time limit for claiming
    - A claim must be submitted within 2 months of the end of the billing cycle
