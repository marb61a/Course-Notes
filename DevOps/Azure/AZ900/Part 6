                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 6


7.4 Use Azure Advisor
  - This helps ensure that your resources are configured properly for
    - High-availability, efficiency and security
  -



Module 3: Understand Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Trust
Lesson 8: Understand Securing Network Connectivity in Azure
8.1 Understand Azure Firewall
  - Firewalls prevent bad traffic entering your network
  - Azure Firewall
    - This uses rules to determine if traffic is allowed
      - NAT -- Network Address Translation rules
      - Network Rules
      - Application Rules
    - Rule Order controlled by priority
    - Traffic that does not meet a rules is blocked
    - Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall

8.2 Understand DDoS protection
  - Azure DDoS protection
  - DDoS -- Distributed Denial of Service
  - There are 2 tiers of protection Basic and Standard
  - Basic covers both IPv4 and v6 whereas Standard covers only v6
  - Standard uses Machine Learning to profile traffic
  - One Standard plan can be used with multiple VNets
  - The cose of standard is about $3k per month

8.3 Understand Network Security Groups
  - Network Security Group (NSG)
  - It uses inbound and outbound security rules
  - Rules can be to a specific IP address or an IP range
  - NSG's can be associated with a subnet or a network interface
  - It uses a flow record to store state of connections
  - It can also use service tags

8.4 Choose an appropriate Azure security solution
  - Choosing a solution, some factors will direct the choice
    - NSG is typically used to control the flow of network traffic
    - Azure Firewall should be used if an application exposes a public IP address
    - DDoS protection should be used for guarding sensetive applications which may be targeted
  


Lesson 9: Explore Core Azure Identity Services
9.1 Describe Azure Active Directory
  - Azure provides several identity services
  - What is Identity, it is comprised of 2 concepts
    - Authentication -- Confirms the udentity
      - Can be from using password or biometric component etc
      - Authentication can also be multi-factored
    - Authorisation which happens after authentication
      - It is the process of verifying permission to perform actions
  - Azure Active Directory is not a cloud based version of Windows Active Directory
    - It is a cloud based service for authentication and authorisation
  - A core component is a directory of users

9.2 Describe multi-factor authentication
  - Azure Active Directory can help make Aure resources more secure
    - This is done by using multi-factor authentication
  - There are different authentication factors
    - Most people use something that they know such as a username and password
    - If this is all that is used then this is single factor authentication
    - Another authentication factor is something that someone has eg a mobile phone
    - Something you are eg a finger print
  - Single Factor Authentication is not all that secure
  - Azure MFA is 2 factor authentication
  - Azure MFA
    - It is only available in Azure Active Directory premium plans
    - It is enabled in the All Users blade in your directory
    - It is enabeld on a per user basis
    - It can be configured for guest users on a conditional access basis 



Lesson 10: Describe Security Tools and Features of Azure
10.1 Describe Azure Security Center
  - MS has resources for protecting resources from attacks on cloud
  - What if the attacks are against on-premises resources
    - These kinds of attacks are more prevalent
    - This is for a couple of reasons
      - User devices are less likely to have been hardened against attacks
      - Users are more likely to connect to insecure resources
      - These factors are a source of huge concern for security
  - To address the above concerns MS has Azure Advanced Protection
    - It is part of the Enterprise Mobility and Security 5 suite
    - There is a multi part deployment to youe environment
      - The first step is to determine capacity
        - This is done be finding the amount of ATP sensors needed in you environment
        - Guidence on how this should be planned is available when purchasing ATP
      - The second step is to create an instance of ATP
        - This can be done using the ATP portal
      - The third step is to connect on-premises Active Directory to ATP
      - The fourth and final step is to download, install and configure ATP sensors
