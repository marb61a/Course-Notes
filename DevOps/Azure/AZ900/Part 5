                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 5


6.3 Describe artificial intelligence (cont)
Azure Machine Learning Service
  - This uses Python to build ML models
  - It builds datasets on premises and upload for ML modelling
    - This differs from the Databricks approach
  - Models are trained in a cluster
  - Models can be exported as either a docker image or an FPGA image
Azure Machine Learning Studio
  - This is a web based drag and drop environment
  - It uses prebuilt ML components including some sample datasets
  - Models can be exported to a web service

6.4 Describe serverless computing
  - The term serverless can be misleading
    - Serverless just means using computing power without explicitly setting up a server
    - This means that code can be ran without provisioning a VM just for this
      - Customers will only pay for what they use
  - Azure Functions
    - They represent the Azure Compute component in Serverless
    - This is serverless trigger based code
    - They run on the Azure App service infrastructure
    - They can be controlled via quotas
    - There are multiple runtimes offered
    - Code can use output bindings to perform complex operations
  - Azure Logic Apps
    - These are similar to Functions and allow for creating Serverless workflows
    - They use drag and drop serverless workflows
    - They use connectors, triggers and actions
    - Workflows are constructed using JSON files
    - Multiple actions can occur in a single workflow
  - Azure Event Grid
    - It listens for events triggered by Azure resources
    - Other services can also trigger on these events
    - It is designed for use with services like Logic Apps



Lesson 7: Understand Azure Management Tools
7.1 Use the Azure portal
  - This is a web based management portal for Azure resources
  - It is fully customizable for each user
  - There is flexible configuration fro specific uses
  - The Azure portal can be browsed to easily
    - https://portal.azure.com/
    - You must be registered and signed in
  - Using the gear icon will allow for customisation
    - You can setup your view many ways including themes, 

7.2 Understand Azure and PowerShell
  - This uses the Powershell AZ module for Azure
  - It is cross platform for all the major OS
  - You will have to login to the account to use Powershell
    - This will be needed each time powershell is launched
  - To login use the following command
  `- Connect-AzAccount -Tenant <tenant_id> -Subscription <subscription_id>
  - This will then prompt to use a web browser to login and generates a code to use
  - To look at the VM's available under your subscription 
    - get-azvm
  - To start the VM you want
    - Start-AzVm -ResourceGroupName <resource_groupname>
  - To stop the VM you wish to stop
    - Stop-AzVm -ResourceGroupName <resource_groupname>
  - When stopping a VM there will be a prompt warning
    - This can cause an issue if there is scripting involved in stopping VM's
    - Then the force option must be used
  - The best way to learn all of the Powershell material is at
    - https://aka.ms/azps
    
7.3 Use the Azure CLI
  - This is the command line for managing Azure resources
  - It can be scripted using a variety of open osurce languages
  - It is cross platform for use with Windows, OSX and Linux
  - As powershell is now cross platform choice will be whichever tool is most familiar
  - Installation will differ depending on the OS being ran
  - To use the cli you need to login (similar to Powershell)
    - At a terminal type -> az login
    - This will open a browser window for logging in
    - Once logged in the window redirects to the cli documentation
  - After logging in with the browser the terminal will be logged in and have some output
    - This will be subscription information
    - The information in cli is in JSON form
    - Information is sent back from Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
      - ARM uses JSON format which is why information returned is in JSON format
  - The examples being demonstrated are the same as the previous section butusing cli syntax
  - To look at the VM's available under your subscription 
    - az vm list
    - To see the output in a table use the following command
    - az vm list --output table
  - To start a VM
    - az vm start --name <name> --resource-group <resource>
  - To stop a VM
    - az vm stop --name <name> --resource-group <resource>
  - These are not case sensitive
  - To see all available commands
    - az vm --help
