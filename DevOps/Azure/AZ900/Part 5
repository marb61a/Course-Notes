                    Course Notes Part 5


6.3 Describe artificial intelligence (cont)
Azure Machine Learning Service
  - This uses Python to build ML models
  - It builds datasets on premises and upload for ML modelling
    - This differs from the Databricks approach
  - Models are trained in a cluster
  - Models can be exported as either a docker image or an FPGA image
Azure Machine Learning Studio
  - This is a web based drag and drop environment
  - It uses prebuilt ML components including some sample datasets
  - Models can be exported to a web service

6.4 Describe serverless computing
  - The term serverless can be misleading
    - Serverless just means using computing power without explicitly setting up a server
    - This means that code can be ran without provisioning a VM just for this
      - Customers will only pay for what they use
  - Azure Functions
    - They represent the Azure Compute component in Serverless
    - This is serverless trigger based code
    - They run on the Azure App service infrastructure
    - They can be controlled via quotas
    - There are multiple runtimes offered
    - Code can use output bindings to perform complex operations
  - Azure Logic Apps
    - These are similar to Functions and allow for creating Serverless workflows
    - They use drag and drop serverless workflows
    - They use connectors, triggers and actions
    - Workflows are constructed using JSON files
    - Multiple actions can occur in a single workflow
  - Azure Event Grid
    - It listens for events triggered by Azure resources
    - Other services can also trigger on these events
    - It is designed for use with services like Logic Apps
