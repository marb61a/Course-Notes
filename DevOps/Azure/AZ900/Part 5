                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 5


6.3 Describe artificial intelligence (cont)
Azure Machine Learning Service
  - This uses Python to build ML models
  - It builds datasets on premises and upload for ML modelling
    - This differs from the Databricks approach
  - Models are trained in a cluster
  - Models can be exported as either a docker image or an FPGA image
Azure Machine Learning Studio
  - This is a web based drag and drop environment
  - It uses prebuilt ML components including some sample datasets
  - Models can be exported to a web service

6.4 Describe serverless computing
  - The term serverless can be misleading
    - Serverless just means using computing power without explicitly setting up a server
    - This means that code can be ran without provisioning a VM just for this
      - Customers will only pay for what they use
  - Azure Functions
    - They represent the Azure Compute component in Serverless
    - This is serverless trigger based code
    - They run on the Azure App service infrastructure
    - They can be controlled via quotas
    - There are multiple runtimes offered
    - Code can use output bindings to perform complex operations
  - Azure Logic Apps
    - These are similar to Functions and allow for creating Serverless workflows
    - They use drag and drop serverless workflows
    - They use connectors, triggers and actions
    - Workflows are constructed using JSON files
    - Multiple actions can occur in a single workflow
  - Azure Event Grid
    - It listens for events triggered by Azure resources
    - Other services can also trigger on these events
    - It is designed for use with services like Logic Apps



Lesson 7: Understand Azure Management Tools
7.1 Use the Azure portal
  - This is a web based management portal for Azure resources
  - It is fully customizable for each user
  - There is flexible configuration fro specific uses
  - The Azure portal can be browsed to easily
    - https://portal.azure.com/
    - You must be registered and signed in
  - Using the gear icon will allow for customisation
    - You can setup your view many ways including themes, 

7.2 Understand Azure and PowerShell
  - This uses the Powershell AZ module for Azure
  - It is cross platform for all the major OS
  - You will have to login to the account to use Powershell
    - This will be needed each time powershell is launched
  - To login use the following command
  `- Connect-AzAccount -Tenant <tenant_id> -Subscription <subscription_id>
  - This will then prompt to use a web browser to login and generates a code to use
  - To look at the VM's available under your subscription 
    - get az-vm
  - To start the VM you want
    - Start-AzVm -ResourceGroupName <resource_groupname>

7.3 Use the Azure CLI
  - 

7.4 Use Azure Advisor
  -

  - 

8.3 Understand Network Security Groups
  -

8.4 Choose an appropriate Azure security solution
  -

9.1 Describe Azure Active Directory
  - 

9.2 Describe multi-factor authentication
  -
