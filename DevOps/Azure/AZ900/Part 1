Introduction
Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Introduction
  - Brief intro to the instructor and a quick run through of the course contents

Understand Cloud Concepts
  - Understand the On-Premises model
    - What is required for on premises applications
      - Physical Hardware which has expenses
        - Hardware upgrade expenses
        - Repair expenses
      - Network Infrastructure
      - Storage areas for server racks
  - The Cloud Model
    - Benefits of the Cloud Model
      - You can rent resources from a provider
      - You can shift capital expenses from capital expenses to operating expenses
      - Reduced costs through better economies of scale
      - It is a consumption model, use and ay for only what you need


Lesson 1: Understand the Benefits and Considerations of Cloud Services
1.1 Understand high availability
  - What is High_Availability
    - Applications and the systems used are available to users
      - What makes an application unavailable
        - A network outage
        - An application failure
        - A system outage such as a VM
        - A power outage
        - An issue with a resilient system eg a database

1.2 Understand scalability, elasticity, and agility
  - Scaling and Elasticity
    - Scaling Out or Horizontal Scaling 
      - Adds additional resources
    - Scaling Up or Vertical Scaling
      - Adds more powerful resources
    - Easily scaling on application metrics is called Elasticity
      - This provides agility for applications

1.3 Describe fault tolerance and disaster recovery
  - The world is not perfect
    - This should be borne in mind when planning for an application etc
  - You should be able to monitor and if necessary react to unhealthy resource
  - Azure has design considerations for fault tolerance
  - You should also have a plan for larger impacts
  - BCDR -- Business Recovery & Disaster Recovery
