                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 1


Introduction
Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Introduction
  - Brief intro to the instructor and a quick run through of the course contents

Understand Cloud Concepts
  - Understand the On-Premises model
    - What is required for on premises applications
      - Physical Hardware which has expenses
        - Hardware upgrade expenses
        - Repair expenses
      - Network Infrastructure
      - Storage areas for server racks
  - The Cloud Model
    - Benefits of the Cloud Model
      - You can rent resources from a provider
      - You can shift capital expenses from capital expenses to operating expenses
      - Reduced costs through better economies of scale
      - It is a consumption model, use and ay for only what you need


Lesson 1: Understand the Benefits and Considerations of Cloud Services
1.1 Understand high availability
  - What is High_Availability
    - Applications and the systems used are available to users
      - What makes an application unavailable
        - A network outage
        - An application failure
        - A system outage such as a VM
        - A power outage
        - An issue with a resilient system eg a database

1.2 Understand scalability, elasticity, and agility
  - Scaling and Elasticity
    - Scaling Out or Horizontal Scaling 
      - Adds additional resources
    - Scaling Up or Vertical Scaling
      - Adds more powerful resources
    - Easily scaling on application metrics is called Elasticity
      - This provides agility for applications

1.3 Describe fault tolerance and disaster recovery
  - The world is not perfect
    - This should be borne in mind when planning for an application etc
  - You should be able to monitor and if necessary react to unhealthy resource
  - Azure has design considerations for fault tolerance
  - You should also have a plan for larger impacts
  - BCDR -- Business Recovery & Disaster Recovery

1.4 Explain economic benefits of the cloud



Lesson 2: Understand the Differences Between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
2.1 Understand infrastructure-as-a-service
  - Infrastructure-as-a-Service -- IaaS
  - IaaS is bottom of the cloud pyramid
    - This has more control than at the top of the cloud pyramid
    - Azure VM

2.2 Understand platform-as-a-service
  - Platform-as-a-Service -- PaaS
    - This is the middle of the cloud pyramid
    - Azure App service

2.3 Understand software-as-a-service
  - Software-as-a-Service -- SaaS
    - This level is right at the top of the cloud pyramid

2.4 Compare service types
  - IaaS Considerations
    - Benefits
      - Use only when needed
      - Powerful virtual machines without paying for hardware
      - Access to cloud services such as Azure Security Center
      - Agility and Fault Tolerance
    - Drawbacks
      - OS and other software installation and management
  - PaaS Considerations
    - Benefits
      - No need to manage OS and other software
      - Take advantage of provided application frameworks
      - Lift and shift capability
      - Turnkey features such as authentication, logging and so on
    - Drawbacks
      - Less flexibility
      - The cloud provider may update or break your application
  - SaaS Considerations
    - Benefits
      - Pay as you go model
      - No management overhead
      - Often unavailable on multiple devices via web
      - Not necessary to have IT staff to manage
    - Drawbacks
      - Use case limited to specific use of a software service
      - During outages software is completely unavailable
