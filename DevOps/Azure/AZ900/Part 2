                    Exam AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
                    Course Notes Part 2


Lesson 3: Understand the Differences Between Public, Private, and Hybrid Clouds
3.1 Understand public cloud
  - The Public Cloud
    - This is a shared cloud provided by the cloud provider
    - Benefits
      - Agility
      - Quick deployment to the cloud
      - Easy management
      - Cost Control
    - Drawbacks
      - Some loss of control
      - There are security and regulatory requirements
      - There will be loss of flexibility

3.2 Understand private cloud
  - The Private Cloud
  - A private cloud infrastructure dedicated to one company
  - Benefits
    - Agility
    - Private Network
    - Can be used without internet access
    - Can help control costs
  - Drwabacks
    - If the infrasrtucture is owned then the costs can be high
    - May be limited in effectiveness of access control to data

3.3 Understand hybrid cloud
  - The Hybrid Cloud
    - A mixture of public and private cloud
      - Benefits
        - Keep some systems on-premises
        - Better support for legacy systems
        - Maintain control over systems
      - Drwabacks
        - Technically complex to connect systems
        - Compatability of data
        - Additional IT expertise required
        


Module 2: Understand Core Azure Services
Lesson 4: Understand Core Azure Architectural Components
4.1 Understand Azure regions
  - Geographies and Regions
  - Azure infrastructure is spread out across the globe
    - They often use country borders
    - There are different regions in a country
  - Within certain regions datacenters have been built
    - Contains physical hardware
    - They are climate controlled
    - Dedicated network infrastructure
    - Isolated power supply
    - Data in and out over MS owned or leased cables

4.2 Explain Availability Zones
  - Availability Zones
    - Designed to protect an application from datacenter failure
      - Unique physical locations within a region
      - One or more datacenters in each Availability Zone
      - At least 3 in each enabled region
    - There are 2 services
      - Zone services
      - Zonal redundant services

4.3 Explain Azure Resource Manager
  - Azure Portal
  - Command Line
  - Visual Studio

4.4 Understand resource groups
  - Resource Groups
    - This is a logical container for Azure resources
    - Using resource groups helps with managing resources
    - It is also a better way to control costs
    - There is an improved billing experience with tags
    - It is fairly easy to redeploy with ARM templates


Lesson 5: Learn Core Products Available in Azure
5.1 Describe Azure compute products
  - Azure Compute Products
    - Compute allows you to dynamically allocate resources
      - This is done in the Azure Portal
      - The portal itself is regularly changing
      - There will be more thorough examination of the portal later in the course
    - Azure Virtual Machines
      - You can create a VM with either Linux or Windows
      - Images can be made or gotten in the Azure Marketplace
      - VM Deployment takes approximately a minute
      - This is so quick because containers are used
      - Fault Tolerance
        - Availability Sets
          - Once the VM is deployed it will be on a physical server somewhere
          - Always be aware if an OS update will reboot a machine
          - Azure may reboot a VM if it determines it to be unhealthy
          - The host OS which holds the VM's can also reboot
          - All of the above can happen without notice
          - One of the ways to cope is by having availability sets
          - Availability sets help to avoid downtime by using 2 logical containers
            - Fault Domains -- Protects from Hardware and other faults
            - Update Domains -- Protects from VM reboots
              - This will allow for fault tolerance
    - Azure App Services
    - Service Fabric
    - Azure Kubernetes Service
    - Azure Container Instances
    - Azure Functions
    - Azure Batch
    - Cloud Services
