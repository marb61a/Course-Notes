Describe Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations
  - You will need to understand the differing types of workloads for AI
  - Anomaly Detection
    - This is an ML technique which analyses data over a time period
    - It checks for any unexpected changes or deviations from the norm
  - Computer Vision
    - This is used to take images or videos and then provide information such as object detection and Image classification
  - Natural Language Processing
    - This is used to analyze text in documents or other text sources
    - It is able to both interpret speech and generate speech
    - It can also translate spoken and written material between different languages
  - Conversational AI
    - This is used for solutions that are normally used to interact with humans.
    - This is where things like chatbots which can converse with people comes in

Microsoft has some guiding principles for responsible AI
  - Fairness
    - One thing is including everyone, when it comes to building an AI solution.
    - There should be in the implementation of the AI solution fairness across all groups of people.
  - Reliability and Safety
    - AI solutions need to be built to the highest standards available
    - For example if used in a medical setting not having best practices could lead to missed diagnosis etc
  - Privacy and Security
    - All data collected by an AI solution must be kept under the highest standard so that privacy and security are maintained
  - Inclusiveness
    - Use data without segregation so all types of people are used to train the ML model
  - Transparency
    - When you're building AI solution, it should not be the case that nobody understands the fundamental principles
    - This includes what happens internally in the solution
  - Accountability
    - When providing an AI solution it is you the human being that is responsible for that
    - It is not the AI solution that should have final responsibility
