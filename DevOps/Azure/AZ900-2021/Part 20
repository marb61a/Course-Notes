                    Course Notes Part 20


Configure the Azure Content Delivery Network
   - Delivery network or CDN is used so that we can take web application content and place in geographically near users that will need it.
  - Content can stem from static web pages on a private website that we host on Azure. We can have files from Azure Blob Storage cached. 
    - We can even reference other publicly accessible web applications and have their content cached. 
  - Click on it to open up its Properties blade, we can see the URL.
  - Just copy the URL and pop that into another web browser window to make sure at least that works.
  - We can see the default page where it states that our App Service application is up and running.
  - So back in the Azure portal, now what I want to do in the Properties blade for that application is scroll all the way down to the networking section.
  - When I select networking over on the right, I can see Azure CDN, content delivery network, and I can choose the link to configure Azure CDN for my app.
  - Go ahead and create a new CDN profile, a new configuration and name appropriately
    - Then go ahead and choose the standard Microsoft pricing tier.
  - The pricing tiers that I can select from the drop-down list really determine the feature set
    - Such as, if I want dynamic site acceleration I would have to use the Standard Verizon or the Standard Akamai, or Premium Verizon configuration
    - Standard Microsoft doesn't support features like dynamic site acceleration
    - The standard Microsoft pricing for CDN also doesn't support features such as mobile device rules.
  - For this example I'm going to stick with Standard Microsoft. 
    - For the CDN endpoint name I'm going to call it webapp172cdn and it's going to tack on the .azureedge.net DNS suffix, at least by default. 
    - Notice that there's a link up above to migrate custom domains to content delivery network configurations here in Azure.
    - At this point go ahead and click Create.
    - After a moment we can see that our content delivery network endpoint is now listed with the status of running.
  - Even though it may be true, it may not be available for a period of time depending on the pricing tier that you've selected. 
    - The thing to do then is to use that URL to test connectivity
    - Pop in the URL here, it includes CDN to make sure that our web application is up and running and should say, our app service app is up and running.
  - We now know that we can serve content through our configured Azure content delivery network.


Moving to the Cloud
  - Organizations looking at moving to the cloud, means that they will have to consider some of the migration options 
    - To migrate data that they might currently host on-premises into the cloud
    - Or migrating applications are currently run on-premises in the cloud
    - And also, any servers that they have running on-premises that might serve up files 
    - Or that might actually run application workloads can also potentially be migrated into the cloud computing environment.
  - With cloud migration, you can either migrate from your existing on-premises environment
    - At the same time if you're already using cloud computing, you might consider migrating from an existing cloud service provider to a new cloud service provider
    - The benefits of moving to the cloud would include first of all, reduced infrastructure expenses, at least compared to what you might have to do on-premises
  - On-premises, you have capital expenditures related to purchasing the hardware to create the supporting IT infrastructure
    - Things like physical servers, storage arrays, UPS backup systems
    - However, in the cloud that's done by the cloud service provider. Another benefit of moving to the cloud, is minimizing capacity boundary issues
    - Cloud providers have the benefit of economies of scale where they have such a vast pool of resources made available to cloud customers
    - They can offer it at a reduced charge compared to what we would have to do if we were doing this ourselves entirely on-premises
  - The other thing is that when you run out of capacity on-premises such as storage
    - You have to then acquire additional hardware and configure it to have that additional storage available
    - That takes a lot longer than it would to simply allocate more cloud storage through a public cloud service provider
    - Yet another benefit is the reduced total cost of ownership, or TCO over time
    - That can be gauged by comparing the ongoing operational expense of cloud computing charges against the on-premises capital upfront expenditures
      - required to acquire all of the equipment to support the infrastructure.
  - Another benefit of moving to the cloud, is the increased global scope and access to redundancy
    - Public cloud service providers have data centers around the globe, and so the benefit of that
    - For example if you're hosting a public facing website, is that you've already got that availability to place that website near users that might access it
    - You also have access to redundancy by replicating content, whether it's files stored in the cloud
    - Or even replicating virtual machines running out workloads to alternate locations around the planet
    - Moving to the cloud means standardizing on file formats.
  - Make sure that you don't move to a public cloud service provider that has a proprietary or customized way of dealing with file formats and data exchange
    - It is better to use open standards, that way you have an easy exit strategy, if you need to switch to a different cloud service provider. 
    - The other consideration when you move to the cloud is that the service offerings
    - Whether they are new ones that will be introduced or changing existing ones
    - There are going to be changes with the way things are done over time with a cloud computing provider
    - And that even includes with the management tools be the command line based or graphically based.
  - Be aware that there are changes that are made, and we may have to go with the flow
    - We don't have a choice because we don't have the underlying control of the infrastructure, the cloud service provider does. 
    - The other consideration is privacy and security, moving to the cloud, it does not mean you have less security
    - Instead, we should consider the security accreditations or the compliance that the public cloud service provider has
    - With various security audits to determine which one we should use.
  - Your organization might be very concerned with privacy and security and there's no reason that can't be achieved in the cloud as it would be on-premises
    - The only distinction being, perhaps less configuration, flexibility and control when it comes to security in the public cloud
    - The other consideration when moving to the cloud is integration
    - For instance, you might have on-premises software components that you're currently running, that you want to leave on-premises.
  - You might want to integrate them with cloud services
    - For example, developers could make API programmatic calls from on-premises software components to talk to cloud services
    - The other consideration are the various cloud models available and the offerings within each
    - First we have software as a service, whenever we refer to a cloud service offering, it usually ends with as a service.
  - It means it's delivered and available over a network, hosted on equipment that is the responsibility of the cloud provider
    - Software as a service or SaaS is normally used by end users, it's prepackaged software
    - This includes things like Office 365, or Google Classroom, or Google documents
    - Platform as a service, or PaaS, is of the most interest to developers
    - It provides operating system, and application, and database stacks
    - And programming tools like centralized code repositories that support continuous integration and delivery, the ability to host custom APIs in the cloud etc
  - Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS is of primary interest to IT technicians, administrators
    - Where we're talking about the underlying virtual machines and the storage that is available in the cloud
    - And also the virtual network capabilities that we can configure
    - So we've got software, platform, and infrastructure available as cloud service models
    - The other thing to consider when moving to the cloud is the cloud provider service-level agreements, or SLAs.
  - There will always be an SLA for each type of cloud service offering
    - If you're looking at storage in the cloud, there might be multiple storage SLAs
    - If there are multiple different service offerings for different types of storage in the cloud
    - Just like there would be an SLA for virtual machine instances in the cloud, which guarantees things like uptime on a monthly basis
    - The other consideration is looking into the security accreditations that the cloud service provider has acquired.
  - For example, if they're PCI DSS compliant may be important if running an e-commerce site and you have to deal with credit card holder information
    - The other thing to consider are the management tools available
    - Whether they're command line based, API programming based, or GUI based
    - And then determining if there are automation and orchestration techniques available with that cloud service provider
    - One of the benefits of the cloud is for repetitive types of tasks, you can automate a lot of those
    - This will speed things up and makes a resilient against human failure.
