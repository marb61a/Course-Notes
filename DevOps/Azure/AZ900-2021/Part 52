                    Course Notes Part 52


View Azure Resource Logs
  - The Azure portal allows you to view activity logs and activity logs are not specific to what's running
    - For example, within a virtual machine, that's diagnostic logging
    - But rather we're talking about activity related to the management of the Azure resource itself
    - For example, here in the Azure portal, if I were to go to the Virtual machines view
    - If I were to click on a virtual machine, I could then view Activity log in the properties blade
    - The default Timespan is your viewing log information for the last 6 hours
  - We can see here a number of operations that were completed against this specific resource
    - In this case such as to Create or Update a Virtual Machine
    - We can see when it occurred, so its date and timestamped
    - We can see the subscription that it's tied to and then who initiated that event.
  - Of course, if we wanted to change the Timespan let's say to the Last month, click Apply
    - Naturally, we're going to have a lot more information to sift through
    - But depending on what our requirements are, that might be what we need to do
    - We can also add multiple filters, right now, we're looking at All severities
    - But what we might do is change that for example, only to see Critical and Errors
  - If we don't have anything reported back that would be great
    - Otherwise, we'll see down below any items related to, in this case, those two selected severities
    - We can also view this type of Activity log for different types of Azure resources
    - For example, we go to Storage accounts, and we pop up the properties blade for a storage account and go to the Activity log
    - Once again, we're going to see information related to activity for that specific resource
  - Because this is a storage account, you can expect the nature of the operations to be a little bit different
    - Such as listing Storage Account Keys for programmatic or command line access
    - Again, we can filter it out based on the Timespan, the severity, even the Resource group
    - And the specific resource which we are looking at the properties blade for
  - If we go to the All resources view, we can also drill down to even more specific types of resources like
    - For example, network interfaces that can be attached to virtual machines
    - If we click on that, once again, we can go to the Activity log and again we've got the filtering
    - If we change the Timespan to something appropriate, then I'll see some reported information related to the management of that specific resource
  - If we go back to something like Storage accounts, then we can also scroll down in the properties blade
    - If we go all the way down under Monitoringe can also view Metrics
  - In this case, for a storage account, we've got metrics related to that specific type of items
    - If we look at the Transactions, we can see based on the time plotted graph here, where the transactions begin to increase
    - Of course, we can change it up instead of Sum, we might want to configure this a little bit differently
  - If you don't have the option to change the aggregation type, then change the metrics
    - If we were to look at the Used capacity, for example, for this particular storage account
    - Then we can look at the Avg or the Sum in terms of aggregation
    - Again, it's all plotted here over days and times, on those days.
  - We can also flip over to virtual machines, and pretty much do the same type of thing in terms of viewing metrics
    - This could be part of what we do to monitor the performance of a virtual machine
    - We'll wait for the list of metrics to pop up, and we might be interested let's say in Percentage CPU
    - Again, the aggregation here, we can look at the Count of instances, the average, Min, Max or the Sum
    - We canjust going to leave it on the average to get an overall picture of CPU utilization over time, for this particular virtual machine.


Configure Alert Notifications
  - While we can manually go to an individual Azure resource and look at its metrics, such as performance metrics
    - It's handy to sometimes be notified automatically when a specific metric value violates a preconfigured threshold
    - For example, here in the Azure Portal, let's say we went to the Virtual machines view and opened up an existing VM
    - In the properties blade, if you go all the way down under Monitoring, you'll be able to click on Metrics
  - You would do the same type of thing for other types of resources, like storage accounts for example
    - For example say that we want to have a look at Percentage CPU
    - We are looking at the average here and we can see the date
    - And the time to which this would apply, where we've got a change in our graph
    - The idea is instead of us having to do this, wouldn't it be great if we could be notified?
  - Notice that we've got an Alerts section over here in the properties blade
    - We also could have clicked New alert rule, right here, while viewing the metrics
    - We are going to click the Alerts area in the properties blade and click New alert rule
    - It's for the virtual machine whose properties blade we're looking at already, that's already there, click Add a condition
  - We are interested in the percentage of CPU utilization
    - Notice we've got Network In, Network Out, Disk Read, Disk Write, a lot of different metrics
    - Percentage CPU will be what we choose here and we can see what it currently is at this point in time
  - Down below, we are going to set the Operator to be Greater than an Average of
    - Notice that the unit of measurement for the Threshold value here in this particular case is percentage
    - If we've got an average utilization CPU above 80%, we want to know about it
    - The frequency of the evaluation here will be every one minute, that's fine, then click Done
  - The next thing we need to do is determine what actions should be taken when that threshold is violated
    - Fr that, down under ACTION GROUPS, we are going to create a new one.
  - Next, we have to specify an Action group name, we will call it Ag1 for action group 1, and the Short name will be the same
    - Down below we have to choose the ACTION TYPE, whether it's Email/SMS/Push or some kind of voice notification
    - Or we can trigger an Azure Function or LogicApp, send this to a Webhook, and so on
  - We are going to use Email/SMS/Push and Voice, and we can call this SMS
    - Then over on the right, wea re going to call this SMS Notify
    - Then we can turn on SMS, and we can specify the phone number
    - Once we've done that for the country code, and we've just filled in a fictitious phone number here of course
    - We would click OK to create this notification
    - Otherwise, instead of SMS, we can also, or in addition to, configure email notifications.
    - This way you will be notified automatically when your configured thresholds are violated, which saves you from having to go and look at all of these metrics.


Create an Azure Dashboard
  - Over time, as you work in the Azure portal, you'll probably realize that there are certain items in the GUI that you access more often than others
    - What you can do is take those items that you do use and place them together on a single dashboard, or you can even build multiple dashboards
    - What we are going to do here is start by clicking Dashboard over on the left here on the portal
    - Then we will click the plus sign at the top to add a new dashboard
    - Then we are going to change the name of it to My Stuff
  - From here we can search for specific tiles in the Tile Gallery 
    - Or we can clear all the search items and view all categories in all resource types
    - And we can manually browse this, we are going to start by adding All resources
  - When we add that, it places it over here on the right, and we can drag it around to determine the positioning
    - We've got a little trash can here in the tile header, which you can remove from the dashboard
    - We've got a context menu that looks like three dots, where I can control things like the sizing.
    - Maybe we'll go ahead and control the sizing a little bit
  - The other thing I can do is search, of course
    - If we are interested in managing Azure Active Directory user accounts, then there's a Users and groups tile in the Gallery
    - We can drag that over and position it where we want it to appear.
