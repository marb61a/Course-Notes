                    Course Notes Part 53


Create an Azure Dashboard (Cont)
  - We also going to search up let's say Events
    - We are interested in storage account events, so there we've got a tile for it and just add that
    - That one requires configuration, so to click Configure tile
    - In this case it needs to know the storage account of interest so select that and then click Apply
    - Once I'm happy with this and assuming that that's everything we need, we are happy, wecan then click Done customizing up at the top
  - Any time that we come back into the portal, we can simply go to Dashboard
    - If we've got more than one, we can switch back and forth between them from the selector list
  - Now we've got a list of all of my resources for quick access to things like virtual machines 
    - And anything else we care to administer through that tile
    - We've also got Users and groups, essentially these are like shortcuts but it's very convenient
    - And we've also got the Activity log for my storage account
    - In this case we would have to, perhaps, choose a different time span that would show me more events.
  - But in the end, what we're trying to do here is take the things that we administer most often in the portal and place them together for convenience
    - The cool thing about this is you can even go full screen, so it really does serve as your primary management pane here in Azure.


Azure Cost Management
  - Everybody is always interested in saving money, whether it's personally or within the organization
    - There are some things to bear in mind with Microsoft Azure that can actually save us money
    - So Azure Cost Management means that we've got a monthly operational expense through cloud computing that we can manage properly
  - That's what we're going to focus on here. It can facilitate budgeting, so you know what to expect for costs of your usage of Azure Cloud services
    - We can also configure billing alerts, so that we get a notification once we get to a certain threshold that might be a warning flag about excessive costs
    - We can even set spending limits. We might even go ahead and tag resources
    - Tagging a resource means that you are adding extra data, metadata to an Azure resource, such as assigning it to a department or a project
  - You might do that for billing purposes, so you can look at costs organized by a tag such as by project or by department
    - We can also make use of the Azure Pricing Calculator
    - This one's a great one to figure out what your costs will be to help you with your budgeting
    - Because the first thing you do is add the Azure resource types you're interested in
    - Let's say it's Azure SQL database and also some infrastructure as a service virtual machines
  - You fill in those details for those types of resources, and finally, you can view a cost estimate
    - So you have a general sense of what you're looking at
    - Of course, that would depend on how long you keep things running
    - Shutting things down especially databases is important when they're not needed to save on costs
    - So what are some best practices? One would be to configure virtual machine automatic shutdown
    - You can do that in the properties blade for a virtual machine.
  - Another is to review VM sizing. Remember that the sizing for a virtual machine really details its horsepower
    - The number of virtual CPUs allocated, the amount of RAM, and so on
    - You might realize over time that you've over allocated those types of resources for one virtual machine compared to the workload it's running
    - So you might be able to scale back on the number of virtual CPUs or RAM.
  - That can be a bit of a balancing act that you'd want to do over time, but it is an important item to inspect
    - If we're using auto-scaling, we want to bear in mind that auto-scaling isn't just for scaling out or adding virtual machines under peak workloads for an app
    - But also, we can configure scaling in when things slow down
    - We might even consider the use of virtual machine reserved instances
    - Reserved instances are an option for cost savings in Microsoft Azure
  - What this means is, ahead of time, you can reserve future capacity for the use of virtual machines or Azure SQL database as examples
    - In either for one year or three years, and when you pay upfront for that much time
    - You get it at a great discount compared to if you weren't reusing VM reserved instances
  - Then we can click on Cost in the Properties blade, and that's what we're looking at here, and it has a recommendation
    - It's a medium impact recommendation here but it does say that we can delete a public IP address that isn't associated with anything
    - That makes sense, why would you want to consume a public IP address in Azure that isn't even being used
    - Unless that's only temporarily not being used, see over on the far right, the potential yearly savings


Azure Pricing Calculator
  - Your company's use of Azure cloud computing services needs to be monitored carefully to make sure that costs are within specific limits
    - For budgeting purposes, we can also use the Azure pricing calculator to get a really solid idea of what we might be looking at for costs ahead of time
    - We've searched up pricing calculator on the Internet, which brought me to this page
  - Where we are looking at the Products tab, on the left we've got a bunch of different Azure service offerings 
    - Like Compute, Networking, Storage, Web, Containers, Databases and so on
    - Those are categories of items that we can add that we can start getting pricing costs or estimates on
    - For example, if we go to Compute, we could see things like Virtual Machines, that also showed up under Featured
    - It doesn't matter which one you go to to select, in this particular case, Virtual Machines.
  - When I select Virtual Machines, we get a little icon of a calculator
    - It says that Virtual Machines was added, which means it was added down below
  - We can see here it's filled in some values but we can change them to suit my budgetary needs
    - For example, which region? where ever you plan deploying some of your stuff in the <any> region
    - We are talking not about Windows but Linux, and we're going to talk about CentOS as the distribution using the Standard TIER
    - Then of course, we can choose the INSTANCE types, the sizing related to this which determines the number of virtual CPUs, the amount of RAM and so on
  - Once we've done that, scroll further down, we can determine whether we using Pay as you go
    - Or we're going with a reserved instance where we can pay ahead of time for 1 or 3 years of usage, which results in cost savings
    - Then we determine how many virtual machine instances and how many hours we suspect that they will be running
    - Because it says here Virtual Machines are billed on a per-second basis.
  - This is all on a per-month basis, so what we could do is even say, well, let's say the number of days we would have this running
    - Because we might be using it for development testing of some kind, would be 8 on a monthly basis
    - As we start adjusting these, the price over here on the right changes
    - Now we've got US dollars listed here as the currency, and it's $10.75
    - But if we were to increase the amount of virtual machine instances, notice that the pricing is changing.
  - Down below, we can determine, well, okay, what's the disk configuration for those virtual machines?
    - We can determine the amount of data Disks, the anticipated amount of Storage transactions and again, we can finally see our Sub-total at the very bottom.
  - But what about other types of items besides just virtual machines
    - Let us say we want to get some pricing information related to Azure SQL Database
      - We can choose the Databases category and click on Azure SQL Database, it gets added
      - Down below, if we go past my virtual machine stuff, we'll see the Azure SQL Database, okay.
  - Once again, which region do you think you'll deploy this in? 
    - Is it going to be a Managed Instance or just a Single Database?, leave it on Managed Instance
    - We've got a lot of details specific here to, in this case, Azure SQL Database
    - We can choose the INSTANCE type. And down below, the Billing Option, Pay as you go or reserved billing
  - You want to be careful with this one because look at the pricing. We're at $1,600 a month in US dollars
    - That's because we're talking about running instances every hour of the month, and that's only one instance
    - Databases can cost a lot, you want to make sure you shut these things down when they aren't being used
    - Let's say that we suspect we only really want to use this about 9 hours a month, now we've got better pricing
  - As we go further down, we can determine Storage and the Support type
    - Finally, we've got our monthly bill total down here, which, of course, is relative to not just the cost for Azure SQL Database 
    - But also our cost up above for our compute through virtual machines
  - You see how we can continually add various types of Azure service offerings that we anticipate we will use
    - And how we will use them, to start getting a sense here of what kind of pricing that we would be looking at
    - Notice here that we've also got an Export option, so you can download this information and your estimate as an Excel spreadsheet
  - Or you can save it as an estimate that you can access when you log on by going up to the very top and going to the Estimates tab
    - Either way, this is a great tool so that you can start planning your budgets accordingly for your usage of Azure services.
