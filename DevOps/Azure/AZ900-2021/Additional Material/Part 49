Azure AD Dynamic Groups Overview
  - Azure AD gives you the option of working with the dynamic groups
    - By default, you're working with assignment types of groups
    - So they're static groups where you need to manually add members to the groups
    - Of course, groups facilitate permissions management as opposed to assigning permissions to individual user accounts.
  - The first thing to bear in mind is that we're talking about the automatic membership of a group for either users or devices.
    - You can build a dynamic user group or a dynamic device group
    - You can't have both in the same group at the same time
    - So this is based on us filling in attributes for users and devices within Azure AD
    - Some of them are filled in automatically like a device platform
    - But other things like the department that a user is in would have to be filled in manually by the administrator
    - To work with dynamic groups then in Azure AD, you need to have at least an Azure AD Premium P1 license.
  - Working with dynamic groups means we have to think about when evaluation occurs
    - When you initially create the dynamic group, you need to watch the status of it before you try to expect to see members 
    - Because it takes a few moments to go through your Azure AD tenant to find those attribute values that meet your conditions
    - Now, whenever you make a change, for example, to a user property like their department membership
    - Then it will evaluate which dynamic groups that user should show up in
    - The other thing is that resource access can be granted to dynamic groups just like licenses can
    - It's no different than if you were working with a normal static assignment group.
  - Let's take a look at some examples of the syntax for the rules within dynamic group configurations
    - And a rule can consist of one or more expressions that you might join with and, or or
    - We usually create these rules in the portal, and that means we're selecting from drop down lists and the syntax is being generated for us
    - For example, user.type -eq "Guest", now for group containing only Guest, user.companyName -ne to null, user.department -eq to "IT".
    - Or we might want to have a group that only consists of user accounts that are enabled, so user.accountEnabled equals true.
  - You can get more complex by adding multiple expressions to a dynamic group rule, as we see in our last example
    - Each expression is enclosed in an opening and closing parentheses
    - So our first condition or expression is user.type -eq "Guest"
    - But at the same time, we also want the user company name to not be empty, so not equal to null where null is a special built in keyword.
  - Our last example is checking the city attribute of Azure AD users, looking to see if it finds "Chicago", "Paris" or "Toronto"
    - We e can also use regular expression type of notation, you'll be familiar with regular expressions 
    - If for instance used to scripting a lot in Unix and Linux environments.
  - Our first example here is user.department and we're trying to -match "IT.*", what does that mean? 
    - Well, IT.* means we want to have any number of characters following IT, it's one way to do that.
  - Next, we have two expressions again with an enclosed parentheses, first one is (user.objectId -ne null) and (user.usertype -eq "Member").
    - Then we've got device examples, device.OSType = "iPhone", or the device manufacturer equaling "Motorola".
    - So we have a number of options available when we are building the rules, which could consist of multiple expressions for our dynamic user and device groups.


Azure AD Dynamic Group Creation
  - In Azure AD, a dynamic group is one whose members aren't statically assigned or added as members to the group
    - But instead, membership rules are evaluated based on user attributes to determine if they're a member
    - Give it a whirl here in the Azure AD tenant by the name of Quick24x7.
  - What we want to do is navigate to Groups as we normally would to build a group.
    - And just as normal, we are going to click the New group button.
  - The default group type that we'll see here at the top is Security as opposed to Office 365
    - We are going to leave it at that. Down below the Membership type by default is set to Assigned, where we manually add members to the group
    - They remain members till such time that we come back to the group and remove them.
    - We can also elect to build a Dynamic User or a Dynamic Device group.
  - We are going to create a Dynamic User group, and are going to call it All Enabled Users.
    - Down at the bottom, click the Add dynamic query link and we're going to add one or more query rules to determine membership in this group.
  - First thing you have to do is Choose a Property in this case
    - Because it's a dynamic user group, a user property, and they're listed alphabetically
    - Here: accountEnabled, displayName, city, companyName, country, department, givenName, employeeId, and so on.
  - In this case, we are going to choose accountEnabled
    - Now for the operator, we have quite a selection here, it can be All, And, Any
    - Contains, if we don't want to do an exact match or Equals, if we do want to do an exact match.
    - Or we could scroll down and choose things like Not or Not Equals, or Starts With or does Not Starts With.
  - In this case, we are going to choose Equals, because we want to make sure that accountEnabled Equals true
    - We are going to put in a value of true, and are going to press Tab to move on, or we can click outside of that.
  - We can see the Rule syntax has been added here. Now we could keep adding expressions to this rule.
    - If we click Add expression, it adds another line down below.
    - We can link it to the previous part of the expression using And so both conditions would have to evaluate to true for a member to become in this group.
  - Or it could be the Or operator. By using Or what we could specify is that 
    - Either one of those conditions must evaluate to true before user would be a member of the group
    - In this case, we are just going to leave it as that very simple and click Save and then we'll click Create.
    - All we're doing here is creating a group. It just happens to be Dynamic which we can see under the Membership Type column.
  - When we go into that group, just like a standard statically assigned member group
    - We can go to the Members area over on the left to see the members of the group.
    - However, it says, No members have been found.
  - That's normal, initially, when you create a new dynamic group
    - If you click the Overview blade for this new dynamic group, over on the right, you're going to want to wait a moment.
  - You might have to wait a moment, till you can see the Membership processing status
    - Currently, there's nothing there, there's also nothing in the field for Membership last updated
    - Let's just click on something else and come back to it.
  - Sometimes you have to do that because it's not immediate before you'll see that it's in the midst of evaluating group members
    - We're just going to wait a moment and then come back to the screen.
  - After a moment when we come back, we can now see the Membership processing status shows Evaluating and the Membership last updated shows In Progress
    - We'll just wait a few moments for to evaluate which users should be a member of this dynamic group. 
    - Before too long, we'll see that the Membership processing status will change to Update complete
    - Then in the Membership last updated field will have a date and timestamp of when that occurred
    - Let's go back and check out the Members of the group.
    - So really in this case, it should be any enabled Azure AD accounts will show up as members, which they do here. 


Azure AD Group License Assignment
  - Azure administrators can acquire licenses that they can then apply to specific users or groups in their Azure AD tenant that require those license features.
    - So to get started here in the portal, let's go into Azure Active Directory.
    - So that's going to take us into our AD tenant, where the first thing we should do is take a look at Licenses.
    - Within here, for example, if we click All products, we'll see any licenses that have been acquired and are available here in Azure AD.
  - We can see there are two of them. One's an Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license
    - The other one is Enterprise Mobility + Security E5. Now we can also see the number of Assigned licenses for users or groups
    - Really, it's assigned to users specifically but can be assigned through groups by assigning it to members of a group.
    - We can see the Assigned user number here and the Available number of licenses.
  - We going to go back to my Azure AD tenant and we are going to go into Groups.
    - Here we have a list of groups, we are going to select one, let's say EastAdmins and click Licenses over on the left.
    - When we do that we can see on the right it says No license assignments found.
