Azure AD Groups and the Portal

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Groups and the Portal. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

Managing user permissions, such as to which enterprise apps they have access to, can be cumbersome when you do it on a per user basis. Can do it at the group level, too. Organizing users into groups, assigning permissions to the groups. So what we're going to do here in the portal is create an Azure AD group and

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, a blade called "Quick24×7" is open. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

add some members. To get started, I've already navigated the portal to my Azure AD tenant, where I'll then click Groups in the left hand navigator.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Groups" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "All groups" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a table with two rows and several column headers. [Video description ends]

I can see any existing groups. Here we can see we've already got a Dynamic group where a membership is determined dynamically by looking at user attributes. And we've also got a standard statically Assigned group, which we'll be creating here. So I'm going to click New Group at the top. This group is going to be called EastAdmins.

[Video description begins] A blade called "New Group" opens. [Video description ends]

So the group type will be Security, as opposed to Office 365,

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down list box labeled "Group type" and a drop-down list opens. In the list, he points to options labeled "Security" and "Office 365". [Video description ends]

the name will be EastAdmins. I can put in a Group Description, and the Membership type here is set by default to Assigned, and that's what I want to do.

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down list box labeled "Membership type" and a drop-down list opens. In the list, he points to an option labeled "Dynamic User". [Video description ends]

What that means is that you're adding the members of the group manually, as opposed to a Dynamic User group where you specify rules that contain one or more expressions that determine whether the user is a member of the group or not.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Add members" opens. [Video description ends]

Well, in this case, it's just going to be Assigned.

[Video description begins] In a search box labeled "Search", he enters the text, "group". [Video description ends]

So down under Members I'm going to click No members selected, and I'm going to add some members.

[Video description begins] He enters the text, "lucas" in the search box. [Video description ends]

Now the members can even be existing groups.

[Video description begins] In the search results, he selects a user labeled "Lucas Brenner" and the user appears in a section labeled "Selected items". [Video description ends]

So here I've got a dynamic group called All Enabled Users that I could add as a member.

[Video description begins] He enters the text, "jen" in the search box.

And if I look for the word group, I've also got a static assigned group called Group1 that could also be a member of the group.

[Video description begins] In the Selected items section, he points to the Lucas Brenner and Jen Hill users. [Video description ends]

So groups can be nested in other words. However, that's not what I'm going to do here.

[Video description begins] The Add members blade closes. [Video description ends]

I'm just going to add a couple of standard user accounts that I've created in Azure AD.

[Video description begins] In the New Group blade, he clicks a button labeled "Create" and the blade closes. In the table, a new row is added. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to type in, for example, Lucas. I'm going to add this user, Lucas Brenner down here under Selected items, and I'm going to add user Jen Hill, so I'll add her down below.

[Video description begins] He clicks the new row and its corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. [Video description ends]

So those are the members of this group.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Members" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. The page includes two members labeled "Jen Hill" and "Lucas Brenner". [Video description ends]

So I'll go ahead and click on Select and Create.

[Video description begins] He selects the Jen Hill member and points to buttons labeled "Remove" and "Add members". [Video description ends]

Now, we can now see after a moment, and we have our Successfully created group notification in the upper right.

[Video description begins] He points to a button labeled "Import members". [Video description ends]

We'll notice that we have our EastAdmins group and that Azure has assigned an object Id.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Owners" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several column headers and no rows. [Video description ends]

To Security group it's Assigned, and if I click on it at any point in time, I can go back and see the members of the group, and I can also of course change the members of the group.

[Video description begins] The corresponding blade opens. It includes a user called "Codey Blackwell". [Video description ends]

So I could select somebody here and Remove them, I could Add members. I could even do a bulk import of members if I have a CSV file formatted correctly.

[Video description begins] He selects the Codey Blackwell user and it appears under a section labeled "Owners". [Video description ends]

I could also go to group owners if I want to determine who should have the ability to control the group, to manage it, in terms of adding and removing members.

[Video description begins] In the table, a row is added with a row entry labeled "Codey Blackwell". [Video description ends]

So for example, if I click Add owners, I can do that. I'm going to add user Codey Blackwell as the owner of the group.

[Video description begins] He switches to the All groups page. [Video description ends]

Click Select, and there's user Codey Blackwell. So at this point we now have created a new group by the name of EastAdmins, and its purpose is to really facilitate the assignment of permissions.

Azure AD Groups and the CLI

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Groups and the CLI. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

Azure AD groups can be created and managed at the command line using the as your CLI, which I'm going to spawn here in the portal by clicking on the Cloud Shell icon.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Quick24×7 blade is open. [Video description ends]

Now, it says that my Cloud Shell has timed out, which indicates I was previously connected. 

[Video description begins] A pop-up box appears. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to click the Reconnect button to relaunch the Cloud Shell.

[Video description begins] A page called "PowerShell" opens, which includes the text, "Requesting a Cloud Shell.Succeeded". [Video description ends]

The first thing we're going to have to do is figure out what the command syntax will be in the CLI so that we can create and also that we can manage groups in the cloud. So after a moment, we're good to go.

[Video description begins] In the page, the text, "Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell" appears and the prompt "PS /home/danlachance72>" is displayed. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to clear, we reconnected to our Cloud Shell session.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

I'm going to start by running az ad -h for help, because I don't know what the next level command is. And I see that we have group.

[Video description begins] The output displays a group called “az ad” and a list of subgroups with their descriptions. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So following that I can do az ad group, I know that part of the syntax, and then -h after that.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group -h. The output displays a group called “az ad group” and a list of subgroups and commands with their descriptions. [Video description ends]

And then we'll see what we can do about groups.

[Video description begins] In the output, he points to "member" and "owner" subgroups. [Video description ends]

So we can work with members, owners, we can create a group, we can delete a group, we can get member groups, we can list groups in Azure AD or show details about an individual group, a lot of options here.

[Video description begins] In the output, he highlights the commands. [Video description ends]

So let's take a look at how they actually work.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

All right, so I'm going to start with az ad group create, and I'm going to set --display-name, in this case to Team1. Next thing I have to do is add a mail nickname, --mail-nickname, and it's going to be the same thing in this case, Team1. So I've created a new group. And we're going to verify this in a couple of ways, one being in the portal.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group create --display-name "Team1" --mail-nickname "Team1". The output displays several properties of the Team1 group. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So let's take a look at our groups and our Azure AD tenant. And yeah, there's Team1 that worked, let's go back into the CLI, and let's verify our work in here as well. So we'll start by running az ad group list.

[Video description begins] He minimizes the page. In the navigation pane, he selects the Groups option and the Groups blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. In the table, a new row is added with a row entry labeled "Team1". [Video description ends]

That's going to list all of our groups, well a little bit too much detail, actually.

[Video description begins] He switches to the PowerShell page and executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

So why don't we use the up arrow key to bring that back.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group list. The output displays a list of groups with their properties. The prompt does not change. He then executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

One thing we could do is pipe that to grep, and simply ask for the displayName attribute. And grep is case sensitive, so be careful that you have a capital N in displayName. You can always turn off case sensitivity. But anyways, that's the default.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group list | grep displayName. The output displays the display name for all the groups in the directory. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So we can see that our Team1 group exists, it's been created. Now what I want to do is I want to see any members within that group. So if I do az ad group member list, of course the group here in this case it's called Team1. Well, we're going to get a whole lot of nothing because nobody has been added, it's brand new group.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group member list -g Team1. The output reads "[]". The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Now I want to add a user to the group. So let's start by running az ad user show. And I want to really see the ID. So the user here is going to be lbrenner@quick24x7test.onmicrosoft.com. So that's the full username for that account. And really what I want to see, I'm going to pipe that grep. I want to see the objectId, capital I with Id there.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad user show --id lbrenner@quick24×7test.onmicrosoft.com | grep objectId. The output displays an object Id for the user "lbrenner@quick24×7test.onmicrosoft.com". [Video description ends]

Okay, so I need this ID, because that's what I'm going to use to add that user lbrenner to the Team1 group. So I'm going to copy that ID.

[Video description begins] In the output, he highlights the object Id. [Video description ends]

So it's continuing on az ad group member add in this case the group with -g is Team1 in this case, and -- member-id. This is where I'm going to right click and paste in the ID for that user. Okay, let's press Enter and see what happens.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group member add -g Team1 --member-id a4f37257-5458-4576-bced-7c017d999dc7. No output returns and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Well, no news is good news. Let's clear the screen and let's run az ad group.

[Video description begins] He then executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

We'll not list because we want to show details about a specific group. So show -g Team1. Let's see what we see here. Okay, well, we have a lot of properties there, it's a little overwhelming.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group show -g Team1. The output displays several properties of the Team1 group. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Let's bring that up with the up arrow key again, maybe we'll pipe that to grep. 

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

We can also use the --query parameter here in this electing to use grep for no good reason just because. All right, object Id is what we're greping for, and it looks like we've got the ID here shown.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group show -g Team1 | grep objectId. The output displays an object Id of the Team1 group. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Now this is the ID of the group. Okay, let's just check our work here in the portal, we'll see if things are lining up. So I'm just going to minimize this, and there's Team1.

[Video description begins] He minimizes the page. [Video description ends]

So I can see the ID for Team1 there. We'll also see that here when we go into the overviews, so the Object Id is 150ddca7 and so on.

[Video description begins] In the table, he clicks the Team1 row entry and its corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

That's pretty much what we saw back here, okay, so that's the correct group.

[Video description begins] He switches to the PowerShell page and points to the object Id. [Video description ends]

And let's look at the members of this group.  

[Video description begins] He minimizes the page. He then selects an option labeled "Members" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

We'll see that our user, Lucas Brenner, has been added.

Azure AD Groups and PowerShell

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Groups and PowerShell. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

You can use PowerShell to create and manage Azure AD groups. Sometimes this is advantageous because you might want to script something or maybe you're just more comfortable and quicker working at the command line in PowerShell than you are using the portal.

[Video description begins] The PowerShell page is open in the Microsoft Azure portal. The prompt "PS /home/danlachance72>" is displayed. [Video description ends]

Then here within the portal, I've clicked the Cloud Shell icon, and that's where I'm going to run my PowerShell cmdlets. You could just as well do this if you've downloaded and installed the Azure module on-premises. Here, I'm doing Cloud Shell just because. So the first thing I'm going to do is run get-command. And I'm going to assume that the command is something like new*group,* maybe something after it, who knows? I don't know the name of the cmdlet.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-command new*group*. The output displays a list of cmdlets . The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Then we get quite a bit of a return list, so I'm just going to kind of go up through and take a look to see. It looks like this one's the one we're interested in, New-AzADGroup.

[Video description begins] He scrolls up through the output and highlights a cmdlet called "New-AzADGroup". [Video description ends]

And if we want help on it, we can run get-help new-azadgroup, we can even ask for detail, I can even pipe that to more to stop after the first screen fall. So we have a synopsis, Creates a new active directory group. True, in Azure it does.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. He then executes the following command: get-help new-azadgroup -detail | more. The output displays the details of New-AzADGroup. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

We can see the syntax listing, and as we keep going through the help screen, we can see the parameters.

[Video description begins] In the output, under "SYNTAX", he highlights "New-AzADGroup". [Video description ends]

And finally, we have an example of how it's used at the bottom. So it looks like we're going to specify the DisplayName and the MailNickname.

[Video description begins] He scrolls down through the output and highlights the text, "PS C:\> New-AzADGroup -DisplayName "MyGroupDisplayName" -MailNickname "MyGroupNick". [Video description ends]

Okay, it looks pretty easy, let's clear the screen let's make it happen, new-azadgroup -displayname.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: clear. No output returns and the screen clears. [Video description ends]

Now you have to have planned the nomenclature ahead of time and it needs to be consistent and adhere to organizational naming conventions. I'm going to call this "Team2", and I'm going to set the -mailnickname. Also to, actually, I'm not going to specify it here, because if I don't, it'll simply prompt me if it's mandatory, which it is. So we know we could use -MailNickname and give a nickname to it because we haven't, it prompts us for it.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: new-azadgroup -displayname "Team2". The window prompts "MailNickname:". [Video description ends]

And that's fine, that's normal behavior. However, if you want to automate this in a script, well, you're going to want to use the -MailNickname parameter then, so it doesn't stop and ask for this when the script runs.

[Video description begins] He enters "Team2" and some details are displayed. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Anyways, I'm just going to put in Team2, it looks like it's good, so let's clear the screen, let's run get-azadgroup to list them all.

[Video description begins] The output displays a list of groups with their details. [Video description ends]

And we can see a number of groups here including Team2, and of course, here in the portal, let's just go to Groups All groups, well, I may have to click Refresh. And there it is, Team2 is now there with the Azure assigned Object Id.

[Video description begins] In the table, a new row is added with a row entry labeled "Team2". [Video description ends]

And we can see the default group type is that the membership will be Assigned. In other words, users are statically assigned or added to the group. Now, I want to add a member to Team2, so I need to go and look at my Users. I could do this of course from PowerShell or even the CLI, I'm going to pick user Jen Hill.

[Video description begins] He opens the Quick24×7 blade. In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Users" and a blade labeled "Users" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "All users" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. The page includes a list of users. [Video description ends]

What I'm interested in regards to that user is her Object ID.

[Video description begins] He selects a user called “Jen Hill” and the corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go ahead and copy that to the clipboard.

[Video description begins] He selects an icon labeled “Copy to clipboard” adjacent to the value in a text box called “Object ID”. [Video description ends]

Let's go back into PowerShell, where I'm going to add a member to the group.  

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Cloud Shell" and the PowerShell page opens. [Video description ends]

So what I'm going to do is run the add-azadgroupmember -memberobjectid, and I'm going to paste in Jen Hill's user Object ID that was assigned by Azure. But I've also got to specify the -targetgroupobjectid.

[Video description begins] He enters the following command: add-azadgroupmember -memberobjectid 9e2d30e1-36e1-4d96-8a24-dab15a19ea36 -targetgroupobjectid. [Video description ends]

I could have stored that in a variable or retrieved it using command line tools, but here I'm just going to go back into the portal just to demonstrate where it is visually.

[Video description begins] He minimizes the page and switches to the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

And I'm going to go into Team2, and once that pops up, I'm interested in the Team2 group's object Id, which is listed here, I'll just click the Copy to clipboard icon.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects the Groups option and the Groups blade opens. The All groups page is open in the blade. [Video description ends]

And let's go back and let's paste that into PowerShell, let's press Enter.

[Video description begins] In the table, he clicks the Team2 row entry and its corresponding blade opens. The Overview page is open in the blade. [Video description ends]

So we've added a user to the group by specifying both the user object ID and the group object ID.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Cloud Shell button and the PowerShell page opens. [Video description ends]

So if we were to, for example, check our work here in the portal, let's take a look at the members of the Team2 group.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: add-azadgroupmember -memberobjectid 9e2d30e1-36e1-4d96-8a24-dab15a19ea36 -targetgroupobjectid 5ca25352-a337-4d70-ae42-0c73e19178d7. No output returns and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

We now see Jen Hill is listed, we can also verify that using PowerShell.

[Video description begins] He minimizes the page. In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Members" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

To that, I'll use get-azadgroupmember, I'll use the -groupobjectid parameter. 

[Video description begins] He clicks the Cloud Shell button and the PowerShell page opens. [Video description ends]

And here, I've pasted in the Azure assigned ID for that group.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azadgroupmember -groupobjectid 5ca25352-a337-4d70-ae42-0c73e19178d7. The output displays the details of the Jen Hill member. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

And if I press Enter, indeed, we see user Jen Hill is now a member of Team2. 

Azure AD Deleted Groups

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Deleted Groups. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In Microsoft Azure, you can create and manage Office 365 groups which might be used to control access to SharePoint sites, or to Exchange mailboxes, and so on. Here in the portal, I've gone into my Azure AD tenant.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Groups blade is open. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

I've gone into the All groups view. And I can see I've got a number of existing security groups.

[Video description begins] He points to the content pane. [Video description ends]

Well, when I delete a security group, it doesn't show up under Deleted groups. I can't restore it.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he points to an option labeled "Deleted groups". [Video description ends]

That only applies to Office 365 types of groups. So let's start by building a new Office 365 group.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "New group" and the New Group blade opens. [Video description ends]

So first thing we're going to do is make sure we choose the appropriate type, because the default is infact Security. So I'm going to choose Office 365. We're going to call it Off365Group for clarity.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Group type drop-down list box and a list opens. He selects the Office 365 option. [Video description ends]

And we could either have it Assigned, where we statically add members to the group. 

[Video description begins] In a text box labeled "Group name", he enters the text, "Off365Group". [Video description ends]

Or we could have a Dynamic User group, where we build rules that contain expressions, the user attributes to determine membership.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Membership type drop-down list box and a drop-down list opens. He then points to options labeled "Assigned" and "Dynamic User". [Video description ends]

I'm just going to leave it on Assigned, not even going to add any members, just going to click Create.

[Video description begins] The blade closes. In the table, a new row is added with a row entry labeled "Off365Group". [Video description ends]

So we've got our new Off365Group, and of course under the Group Type column, notice it says Office. So I'm going to go ahead and select that group and Delete it. So Delete the selected groups? OK.

[Video description begins] He selects the row with the Off365Group row entry and clicks a button labeled "Delete". A message box opens. [Video description ends]

At the same time, I'm going to choose a Security group, it's not Office 365.

[Video description begins] The selected row is deleted. [Video description ends]

It's called Team1, and I'm going to Delete it as well, and I'll choose OK. So now when we go to the Deleted groups view, notice the only thing we see is the Off365Group.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled “Deleted groups” in the navigation pane and the corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Because Security groups don't get this option where you have up to 30 days where you can restore the group. So I can select my Off365Group. I can elect to delete it permanently, or I can choose to restore it and its members, if there are any members. So I'm going to go ahead and choose Restore group Yes, want to go back to All groups.

[Video description begins] A message box opens, which reads: Do you want to restore deleted groups? He selects a button labeled “Yes”. The selected row is removed from the table. [Video description ends]

The Off365Group now shows up again. So any group members that were a member of that group before I deleted it will still be a member. Just bear in mind that when you delete groups, you are never deleting the members of that group, just the group itself.

Azure AD Windows 10 Device Join

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Windows 10 Device Join. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

You can join Windows 10 devices to an Azure AD tenant. And the benefit of doing this is for centralized management. It allows the station to be joined to the domain, and it allows users to use that station and sign in with their Azure AD credentials and gain access to cloud based resources. So to get started here in the portal, let's go to our Azure AD tenant.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, a page called "Home" is open. [Video description ends]

Let's go to the Devices view. Currently there are no devices in this tenant.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option labeled "Azure Active Directory" in a section labeled "Azure services" and the Quick24×7 blade opens. From the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Devices" and a blade called "Devices" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "All devices" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. The page includes a table with no rows and several column headers. [Video description ends]

It says no device found, but that will change shortly. Let's go back to our tenant and let's go into our list of users.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Quick24×7 blade. From the navigation pane, he selects the Users option and the Users blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All users option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Because you need to join a Windows 10 device to the domain, given a specific set of user credentials, and we're going to use Mr. Lucas Brenner.

[Video description begins] He clicks a user called "Lucas Brenner" and its corresponding blade opens. A page called “Profile” is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go ahead and copy this person's email address. And of course I have the password as well and we're going to use these credentials to join a Windows 10 device to the tenant. Here on my Windows 10 computer, I've gone into Windows settings from the start menu and I'm going to search for work. And I'm going to choose access work or school.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

And this is where we want to connect to Azure AD Connect to our account. So I'm going to click Connect. And at this point, it's going to ask for credentials. So I'm going to put in the email address for Lucas Brenner.

[Video description begins] A wizard labeled "Microsoft account" opens. In the wizard, a page is open, which includes a section labeled "Set up a work or school account". [Video description ends]

And I'm going to click Next. Of course, the next thing is it's going to want to know is what's the password for that account? Go ahead and put that in and I'll click Sign in. So we can see it's registering the device with Azure AD and after a moment, it'll say you're all set! You've added your account, you now have access to your organization's apps and services. That's great.

[Video description begins] The wizard closes. [Video description ends]

If I click the Done button after a moment when the screen refreshes, we can see here that this computer is connected to an Azure account so we can see the email address listed here.

[Video description begins] An option labeled "Work or school account" appears with the e-mail address "lbrenner@quick24×7test.onmicrosoft.com". [Video description ends]

Let's go back and check it out in the portal. So back here in the portal, let's go to our Azure AD tenant and let's go to the Devices view.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Microsoft Azure portal. [Video description ends]

And sure enough, we can see the Windows computer name here.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Quick24×7 blade. From the navigation pane, he selects the Devices option and its corresponding blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All devices option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

We can see it's Enabled, the OS is Windows. We can see the version. 

[Video description begins] In the table, he points to a row entry labeled "LAPTOP-E41MU5AM" under a column header labeled "Name". [Video description ends]

It's Azure AD registered, and that was done with Lucas Brenner's credentials. So Lucas Brenner, the user, then, is listed as the Owner. There's no Mobile Device Management, or MDM. And we can see when it was Registered and when it last had Activity. It's date and time stamped. Users can then sign in using their Azure AD credentials to the Windows 10 device. And as administrators in Azure, we can even enable conditional access policies that take a look at the device IP address or the device type to make a decision as to which cloud resources it should have access to.

Azure AD Device Settings

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Device Settings. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

There are many benefits to joining Windows 10 devices to an Azure AD tenant. One of which is the fact that it allows the user to sign into that Windows 10 station using their Azure AD credentials. Additionally, it then gives them access to Azure based resources. Let's take a look at some Azure AD device settings.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Home page is open. [Video description ends]

So here in the portal, I'm going to navigate to my Azure AD tenant. Why don't we start by going to the Devices view?

[Video description begins] In the Azure services section, he clicks the Azure Active Directory option and the Quick24×7 blade opens. [Video description ends]

We'll see any existing devices joined to the tenant.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Devices option in the navigation pane and the Devices blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All devices option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And I've got one Windows 10 laptop. I can click on it to pull up details here, so we can see the Device ID, the Object ID.

[Video description begins] In the table, he clicks the LAPTOP-E41MU5AM row entry and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

We can also see it's running Windows 10. We can see the owner is someone by the name of Lucas Brenner, this is the account that was used to join the device to the domain. And we can see when it was registered with the domain and when it last had activity. Now if the device is configured to store BitLocker, disk encryption keys in a directory service, then we would have BitLocker key information listed here.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Devices blade. [Video description ends]

I'm going to go back to the Devices portion of Azure AD, and I'm going to click on Device settings on the left to open up that blade.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

Now there are a number of device settings here that are important when it comes to determining who is allowed to join devices to the domain.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "Selected" in a setting labeled "Users may join devices to Azure AD" and an option labeled "Selected No member selected" appears. [Video description ends]

Now the default here for Users may join devices to Azure AD is set to All.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Selected No member selected option and a blade called "Members allowed to join devices" opens. [Video description ends]

We could set that to None. We could choose Selected, and then follow through by clicking Selected, clicking the Add button, and basically going through and selecting Azure AD groups or users that should have the ability to join devices to Azure AD.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Add members" opens. [Video description ends]

Again, the default is that anybody can do that. So let's close out of that.

[Video description begins] In the Add members blade, he points to the listed groups and users. He then closes the blade. [Video description ends]

I'm going to put that back on the default of All, then we can determine any Azure AD accounts that should also be added as local administrators on Azure AD joined devices so that they have full admin access to those joined devices.

[Video description begins] He closes the Members allowed to join devices blade. [Video description ends]

Currently it's None. I could choose Selected, I could go through and select Azure AD users or groups, so I can add them.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "All" in the Users may join devices to Azure AD setting. [Video description ends]

And these would be accounts that would have access.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "Selected" in a setting labeled "Additional local administrators on Azure AD joined devices" and an option labeled "Selected No member selected" appears. [Video description ends]

So specifically, we're selecting users here.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Selected No member selected option and a blade called "Local administrators on devices" opens. He then clicks a button labeled "Add" and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

Not groups, but specific users that should have additional, local admin access on those joint devices.

[Video description begins] He points to a list of users. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to close out of that.

[Video description begins] He closes the blade. He then closes the Local administrators on devices blade. [Video description ends]

We also have the option down below to require Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA to join devices to the domain.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "None" in the Additional local administrators on Azure AD joined devices setting. [Video description ends]

And we can specify the maximum number of devices that each user can join. So we have a number of settings here that are available that control how device join works in Azure AD.

Azure AD Device Disable

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Device Disable. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

You have the option of disabling Azure AD joined devices. Now you would disable a device, for example, if the device perhaps is a laptop and it's been lost or stolen. Or if you simply don't want to allow that device to be used to access cloud-based resources in Azure.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Home page is open. [Video description ends]

So to make this happen, to disable a device, we start by going to our Azure AD Tenant which I'm going to do and we go to the Devices view.

[Video description begins] In the Azure services section, he clicks the Azure Active Directory option and the Quick24×7 blade opens. [Video description ends]

Now in the Devices view, of course, we will see all of the domain join devices.

[Video description begins] The Devices blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All devices option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

The one that I want to disable is shown right here. So I'm going to click on the name of it to open up its properties were up at the top, we have the option of disabling it.

[Video description begins] In the table, he clicks the LAPTOP-E41MU5AM row entry and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

Notice you can also Delete it. What disabling might be done temporarily, for example, until we determine whether the laptop will be recovered or not, where Delete is more permanent. I'm going to go ahead and choose Disable, and I'll choose Yes.

[Video description begins] A message box called “Confirm Disable” opens. [Video description ends]

And it tells us that it's successfully disabled that Azure AD device, and of course, we can go back and enable it.

[Video description begins] He points to a button labeled "Enable". [Video description ends]

For example, if the device was temporarily lost and has now been found. But let's go back to our devices view here in our Azure AD tenant.

[Video description begins] He switches to the All devices page. [Video description ends]

We can see that it's not Enabled any longer.

[Video description begins] In the table, adjacent to the LAPTOP-E41MU5AM row entry, he points to a row entry labeled "No" under a column header labeled "Enabled". [Video description ends]

Now this can take a bit of time, for example, it might take 60 minutes before this is actually known by the device. So, you might wonder, why are users still able to use that disable device to sign in? Well, because it's not immediate. The other thing to bear in mind is that, if a user has signed into that device previously. So prior to you disabling it, they will still be able to sign in locally even if there's no network connectivity because there's a cached copy of those credentials. Now of course, the users will not at some point, be able to access cloud-based resources, some point meaning perhaps even up to 60 minutes. They might get a message on their device says, your organization has disabled the device.

[Video description begins] He opens a web page called "Access Panel Applications". [Video description ends]

Also, if the user is signed into their apps control panel, so here it's account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com, I'm signed in as Lucas Brenner, that's the owner of the device.

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down button called "Lucas Brenner QUICK24X7". It includes an option labeled "Profile". [Video description ends]

If Lucas Brenner goes into his Profile, he'll see that the device is shown here.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Profile option and its corresponding page opens. In a section labeled "Devices & activity", he points to a device labeled "LAPTOP-E41MU5AM". [Video description ends]

Now, normally, before the device is disabled, he'll see here that he can disable it. So back here in the portal, let's go in to that device again.

[Video description begins] He switches to the All devices page. [Video description ends]

And what we're going to do is Enable it.

[Video description begins] In the table, he clicks the LAPTOP-E41MU5AM row entry and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

So it says, it successfully enabled the device.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Enable button. [Video description ends]

Let's go back into the my apps access penal for Lucas Brenner.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Access Panel Applications web page. [Video description ends]

So if we go back into the Profile for Lucas Brenner, notice the devices here and notice, we have a link now to disable it.

[Video description begins] He points to a link labeled "Disable device". [Video description ends]

Now that's there because, of course, we just re-enabled it. So there are few ways that this might be enabled to disabled. The user might actually take this upon themselves if they're traveling for work and realize, for example, that their laptop was stolen at the airport, so they can disable it themselves. They know about this feature without involving the help desk at this point.

Azure AD Dynamic Groups Overview

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Dynamic Groups Overview. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

Azure AD gives you the option of working with the dynamic groups. By default, you're working with assignment types of groups. So they're static groups where you need to manually add members to the groups. And, of course, groups facilitate permissions management as opposed to assigning permissions to individual user accounts.

[Video description begins] Azure AD Dynamic Groups. [Video description ends]

So the first thing to bear in mind is that we're talking about the automatic membership of a group for either users or devices. So you can build a dynamic user group or a dynamic device group. You can't have both in the same group at the same time. So this is based on us filling in attributes for users and devices within Azure AD. Now, some of them are filled in automatically like a device platform, but other things like the department that a user is in would have to be filled in manually by the administrator. So to work with dynamic groups then in Azure AD, you need to have at least an Azure AD Premium P1 license.

Working with dynamic groups means we have to think about when evaluation occurs. When you initially create the dynamic group, you need to watch the status of it before you try to expect to see members because it takes a few moments to go through your Azure AD tenant to find those attribute values that meet your conditions. Now, whenever you make a change, for example, to a user property like their department membership, then it will evaluate which dynamic groups that user should show up in. The other thing is that resource access can be granted to dynamic groups just like licenses can. It's no different than if you were working with a normal static assignment group.

[Video description begins] Azure AD Dynamic Group Rules. [Video description ends]

So let's take a look at some examples of the syntax for the rules within dynamic group configurations, and a rule can consist of one or more expressions that you might join with and, or or. Now, we usually create these rules in the portal, and that means we're selecting from drop down lists and the syntax is being generated for us. So for example, user.type -eq "Guest", now for group containing only Guest, user.companyName -ne to null, user.department -eq to "IT". Or we might want to have a group that only consists of user accounts that are enabled, so user.accountEnabled equals true.

[Video description begins] The following lines of code are displayed: user.type -eq "Guest" user.companyName -ne null user.department -eq "IT" user.accountEnabled -eq true. [Video description ends]

Now, you can get more complex by adding multiple expressions to a dynamic group rule, as we see in our last example. Each expression is enclosed in an opening and closing parentheses. So our first condition or expression is user.type -eq "Guest". But at the same time, we also want the user company name to not be empty, so not equal to null where null is a special built in keyword.

[Video description begins] The following line of code is displayed: (user.type -eq "Guest") and (user.companyName -ne null). [Video description ends]

Our last example is checking the city attribute of Azure AD users, looking to see if it finds "Chicago", "Paris" or "Toronto". Now, we can also use regular expression type of notation, you'll be familiar with regular expressions if for instance used to scripting a lot in Unix and Linux environments.

[Video description begins] The following line of code is displayed: user.city -in ["Chicago","Paris","Toronto"]. [Video description ends]

Our first example here is user.department and we're trying to -match "IT.*", what does that mean? Well, IT.* means we want to have any number of characters following IT, it's one way to do that.

[Video description begins] The following line of code is displayed: user.department -match "IT.*". [Video description ends]

Next, we have two expressions again with an enclosed parentheses, first one is (user.objectId -ne null) and (user.usertype -eq "Member").

[Video description begins] The following line of code is displayed: (user.objectId -ne null) and (user.usertype -eq "Member"). [Video description ends]

Then we've got device examples, device.OSType = "iPhone", or the device manufacturer equaling "Motorola".

[Video description begins] The following lines of code are displayed: device.OSType = "iPhone" device.deviceManufacturer -eq "Motorola". [Video description ends]

 So we have a number of options available when we are building the rules, which could consist of multiple expressions for our dynamic user and device groups.

Azure AD Dynamic Group Creation

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Dynamic Group Creation. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In Azure AD, a dynamic group is one whose members aren't statically assigned or added as members to the group. But instead, membership rules are evaluated based on user attributes to determine if they're a member. Let's give it a whirl here in my Azure AD tenant by the name of Quick24x7.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Quick24×7 blade is open. [Video description ends]

What I want to do is navigate to Groups as I normally would to build a group.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And just as normal, I'm going to click the New group button.

[Video description begins] The New Group blade opens. [Video description ends]

Now the default group type that we'll see here at the top is Security as opposed to Office 365. I'm going to leave it at that. Down below notice the Membership type by default is set to Assigned, where we manually add members to the group. And they remain members till such time that we come back to the group and remove them.

[Video description begins] He points to a link labeled "No members selected". [Video description ends]

So we can also elect to build a Dynamic User or a Dynamic Device group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Membership type drop-down list box and a drop-down list opens. He then points to the Dynamic User option and another option labeled "Dynamic Device". [Video description ends]

I'm going to create a Dynamic User group, and I'm going to call it All Enabled Users.

[Video description begins] He selects the Dynamic User option. [Video description ends]

Down at the bottom, I'm going to click the Add dynamic query link and we're going to add one or more query rules to determine membership in this group.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Dynamic membership rules" opens. It includes a table with a single row and several column headers. [Video description ends]

First thing you have to do is Choose a Property in this case, because it's a dynamic user group, a user property, and they're listed alphabetically, here: accountEnabled, displayName, city, companyName, country, department, givenName, employeeId, and so on.

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down list box labeled "Choose a Property" under a column header labeled "Property" and a drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

In this case, I'm going to choose accountEnabled. Now for the operator, we have quite a selection here, it can be All, And, Any, Contains, if we don't want to do an exact match or Equals, if we do want to do an exact match.

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down list box labeled "Choose an Operator" under a column header labeled "Operator" and a drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

Or we could scroll down and choose things like Not or Not Equals, or Starts With or does Not Starts With.

[Video description begins] In the drop-down list, he selects an option labeled “Equals”. He types the text, “true” in a text box labeled “Add a value” under a column header labeled "Value". [Video description ends]

In this case, I'm going to choose Equals, because I want to make sure that accountEnabled Equals true. I'm going to put in a value of true, and I'm going to press Tab to move on, or I can click outside of that.

[Video description begins] The code "(user.accountEnabled -eq true)" appears in a text box labeled "Rule syntax". [Video description ends]

And we can see the Rule syntax has been added here. Now we could keep adding expressions to this rule.

[Video description begins] He points to the existing row in the table. [Video description ends]

If I click Add expression, it adds another line down below.

[Video description begins] A new row is added in the table. [Video description ends]

And we can link it to the previous part of the expression using And so both conditions would have to evaluate to true for a member to become in this group.

[Video description begins] In the new row, he clicks a drop-down list box under a column header labeled "And/Or" and a drop-down list opens. It contains two options labeled "And" and "Or". He points to the options. [Video description ends]

Or it could be the Or operator. By using Or what we could specify is that either one of those conditions must evaluate to true before user would be a member of the group. In this case, I'm just going to leave it as that very simple and I'm going to click Save and then I'll click Create.

[Video description begins] The Dynamic membership rules blade closes. [Video description ends]

So all we're doing here is creating a group. It just happens to be Dynamic which we can see under the Membership Type column.

[Video description begins] The New Group blade closes. A new row is added in the table. [Video description ends]

Now when I go into that group, just like a standard statically assigned member group, I can go to the Members area over on the left to see the members of the group.

[Video description begins] In the new row, he clicks a row entry labeled "All Enabled Users" under the Name column header and its corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

However, it says, No members have been found.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled “Members” and its corresponding page opens in the content pane [Video description ends]

Well, that's normal, initially, when you create a new dynamic group. If you click the Overview blade for this new dynamic group, over on the right, you're going to want to wait a moment.

[Video description begins] A corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

You might have to wait a moment, till you can see the Membership processing status. Currently, there's nothing there, there's also nothing in the field for Membership last updated. Let's just click on something else and come back to it.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "Properties" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And sometimes you have to do that because it's not immediate before you'll see that it's in the midst of evaluating group members. We're just going to wait a moment and then come back to the screen.

[Video description begins] He selects the Overview option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

After a moment when I come back, we can now see the Membership processing status shows Evaluating and the Membership last updated shows In Progress. So we'll just wait a few moments for to evaluate which users should be a member of this dynamic group. 

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects the Members option and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a list of members. [Video description ends]

And before too long, we'll see that the Membership processing status will change to Update complete, and then in the Membership last updated field will have a date and timestamp of when that occurred. So let's go back and check out the Members of the group.

[Video description begins] He points to the list of members. [Video description ends]

So really in this case, it should be any enabled Azure AD accounts will show up as members, which they do here. 

Azure AD Group License Assignment

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Group License Assignment. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

Azure administrators can acquire licenses that they can then apply to specific users or groups in their Azure AD tenant that require those license features.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Home page is open. [Video description ends]

So to get started here in the portal, let's go into Azure Active Directory.

[Video description begins] The Quick24×7 blade opens. [Video description ends]

So that's going to take us into our AD tenant, where the first thing we should do is take a look at Licenses.

[Video description begins] A blade labeled "Licenses" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Now within here, for example, if I click All products, we'll see any licenses that have been acquired and are available here in Azure AD.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he clicks an option labeled “All products” and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. A corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with two rows and several columns. [Video description ends]

So we can see there are two of them. One's an Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license. And the other one is Enterprise Mobility + Security E5. Now we can also see the number of Assigned licenses for users or groups. Well really, it's assigned to users specifically but can be assigned through groups by assigning it to members of a group.

[Video description begins] He points to row entries labeled "7" under column headers labeled "Assigned" and "Available". [Video description ends]

We can see the Assigned user number here and the Available number of licenses.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go back to my Azure AD tenant and I'm going to go into Groups.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Now here I have a list of groups. I'm going to select one, let's say EastAdmins. And I'm going to click Licenses over on the left.

[Video description begins] A blade called "EastAdmins" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Now when I do that we can see on the right it says No license assignments found.

[Video description begins] A page called "Licenses" opens in the content pane. It includes a table with no rows and several columns. [Video description ends]

Okay, well, let's also look at the Members of this group. So we can see we have two users, Jen Hill and Lucas Brenner.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Members" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Okay, having that knowledge, let's go back to Licenses, where there are none, and let's click the + Assignments button.

[Video description begins] The Licenses page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So from here we can determine which ones we're interested in, let's say Enterprise Mobility + Security E5. Now when I check that on, I can select the specific license options I'm interested in.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Update license assignments" opens. [Video description ends]

I want all of them so I'm going to choose Save.

[Video description begins] A list of licenses appears. [Video description ends]

And it says the License assignments succeeded, in this case at the group level.

[Video description begins] He switches to the EastAdmins blade in which the Licenses page is open. [Video description ends]

So if we go back to our EastAdmins group, and again, we might have to click on something else and come back and look at the licenses.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Applications" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. He then selects the Licenses option in the navigation pane and the Licenses page opens in the content pane. It includes a license. [Video description ends]

Then we can now see Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 has been assigned. Now let's go look at the members.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Members option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So if I go back to the Members, we had two of them, Jen Hill and Lucas Brenner. So let's click on user Jen Hill.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Jen Hill" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Profile" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Let's take a look at her licenses.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Licenses" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and two rows. [Video description ends]

Now because she's in a group called All Enabled Users that already had that same product assigned, we can see that it's listed here.

[Video description begins] In the second row, he points to a row entry labeled "Inherited (All Enabled Users)" under a column header labeled "Assignment Paths". [Video description ends]

Not through the group that we just looked at, but through a group she already had it assigned called All Enabled Users.

[Video description begins] In the second row, he points to a row entry labeled "Enterprise Mobility + Security E5" under a column header labeled "Products". [Video description ends]

And notice it says, Inherited. Inherited means that the license wasn't assigned directly, in this case, to this user.

[Video description begins] He points to the Inherited (All Enabled Users) row entry. [Video description ends]

But rather it's inherited by being a member of a group, in this case, the All Enabled Users group. Notice though that up above, for the Azure Active Directory Premium P2 product for this user, be Jen Hill, it says Direct and Inherited.

[Video description begins] In the first row, he points to a row entry labeled "Direct, Inherited (All Enabled Users)" under the Assignment Paths column header. [Video description ends]

So she was directly assigned this product license.

[Video description begins] In the first row, he points to a row entry labeled "Azure Active Directory Premium P2" under the Products column header. [Video description ends]

And also she inherited it because she's in the All Enabled Users group.

[Video description begins] He points to the Direct, Inherited (All Enabled Users) row entry. [Video description ends]

 You don't need both of those assignment paths. Either one of them will do just fine for a given product. 

Azure AD Group Ownership

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Group Ownership. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

You can set owners for Azure AD groups, and as a result, the group owner has the ability to manage that group including things like group membership. Which means that the help desk doesn't need to be involved when users need to become a member of a group, as an example, because the group owner can handle that.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Quick24×7 blade is open. [Video description ends]

So let's take a look at this in Azure AD. I'm in my tenant, I'm going to click on the Groups view over on the left, where I've got a number of groups, one of which is called EastAdmins.

[Video description begins] The All groups page is open in the Groups blade. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click on that group, and I'm going to click on Owners over on the left.

[Video description begins] The EastAdmins blade opens. In the navigation pane, the Overview option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So we'll see any existing owners of the group, but we can add multiple owners.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option labeled “Owners” in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click the Add owners button at the top.

[Video description begins] In the page, he points to an owner called "Codey Blackwell". [Video description ends]

And I'm going to add user Lucas Brenner, an existing Azure AD user, as the owner of this group, in addition to Cody Blackwell being an owner of the group.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Add owners" opens. [Video description ends]

So Lucas Brenner is listed and we have our notification in the upper right, that says the group owner was successfully added.

[Video description begins] He types the text "lucas" in a search box labeled "Search" and the search result displays a user called "Lucas Brenner". He then selects the user and it appears in a section labeled "Owners". [Video description ends]

Here in my web browser, user Lucas Brenner has been signed into account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Select" and the Add owners blade closes. A new owner called "Lucas Brenner" appears in the page. [Video description ends]

Now what are the things that's visible here when you sign into this URL is Groups over on the right.

[Video description begins] He opens the Access Panel Applications web page. [Video description ends]

So we're going to go ahead and click Groups to open that up.

[Video description begins] A web page called "Access Panel Groups" opens. [Video description ends]

Now that opens up a new web browser window, and notice that under Groups I own there's the option to create a group.

[Video description begins] A web page called "Access Panel Manage Group" opens. [Video description ends]

But there's also the EastAdmins group because we just finished adding Lucas Brenner in the QUICK24X7 Azure AD tenant as an owner of the EastAdmins group.

[Video description begins] He points to links labeled "Edit details" and "Delete groups". [Video description ends]

On the right, we see the groups that this user, Lucas Brenner, is in. All Enabled Users, EastAdmins, and also the ability to join a group that's not listed here.

[Video description begins] He points to a list of members and their roles. [Video description ends]

So under the Groups I own, we see the EastAdmins group.

[Video description begins] A dialog box labeled "Add members" opens. It includes a search box. [Video description ends]

And if I click on that to open it up, we can see that this user, Lucas Brenner, has the ability to edit the details or delete the group.

[Video description begins] He selects a user called "Marcia Lin" from the search results. [Video description ends]

And the reason for this here is because Lucas Brenner is listed as an Owner.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "OK" and the dialog box closes. A new member called "Marcia Lin" is added in the list of members with its role as a member. [Video description ends]

Now you can also over on the right where we have a list of the members of the group, click the + sign, the add sign, to add members by searching for them.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Microsoft Azure Portal in which the EastAdmins blade is open. [Video description ends]

So for example, if I search for a user by the name of marcia, well up pops Marcia Lin, we can click Add and then the user is then added to the group.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects the Members option and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And that will be reflected also in the portal. So back here in the portal, looking at the Members of the EastAdmins group, we'll see that Marcia Lin has just been added by the owner, Lucas Brenner. 

Azure AD Group Self-service

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Group Self-service. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

The owner of an Azure AD group has the ability to manage all aspects of that group. Now let's verify this here in the portal.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Quick24×7 blade is open. [Video description ends]

Let's go into our Azure AD tenant, which I've already done.

[Video description begins] He highlights "Quick24×7" in the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

And let's go to the Groups view to view existing groups.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

I'm interested in a group called EastAdmins. So I'm going to click on that group. And I'll start by looking at the Members.

[Video description begins] The EastAdmins blade opens. In the navigation pane, the Overview option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So we've got a single member here in the form of user Jen Hill.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Members option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

But if I go to Owners, we'll see that we've got not one but two owners here.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So user Codey Blackwell, and user Lucas Brenner. We're going to focus on this from the perspective of Lucas Brenner, the group owner. And we're going to take a look at the member list, which again only consists of Jen Hill.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he again selects the Members option and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

What we're going to do is we're going to go back and look at our Users. Here in Azure AD, I have a user called Marcia Lin.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Quick24×7 blade. In the navigation pane, he selects the Users option and the Users blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All users option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a list of users. [Video description ends]

I want to make sure that Marcia Lin is added as a member of the EastAdmins group. But I want her to make a request to join the group.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

And that's where group self service is going to kick in. So let's go back to our Azure AD tenant. Let's go back into Groups.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens. [Video description ends]

And then I'm going to click in the left-hand navigator under Settings, General.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option labeled “Generals” in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane It includes several options. [Video description ends]

At the top, we're going to have some group self-service options. The first of which is whether or not Owners can manage group membership requests in the Access Panel. Now by default in Azure AD, that's set to No. I've already turned it on, so Yes. The second option for Self Service Group Management says Restrict access to Groups in the Access Panel, it's set to No, that's also a default. Now I want to leave it at that. I don't want to restrict access to groups in the Access Panel web interface. I want users to be able to see that. So having done that, that's good. Now what we're going to do is we're going to log into the Access Panel as user Marcia Lin. She's going to request to join the EastAdmins group.

[Video description begins] He opens a file called "Document" in the WordPad window. [Video description ends]

So in a browser, I'm just going to connect to this URL and then sign in as user Marcia Lin.

[Video description begins] In the file, he highlights the URL labeled "account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/". [Video description ends]

Now that I'm signed in as that user, if we were to click Groups here, because we didn't restrict group access in the Access Panel, it's why that showed up.

[Video description begins] He opens the Access Panel Applications web page. [Video description ends]

We can see groups that this user, Marcia Lin, is in. All Enabled Users, but she also has the option here to join a group.

[Video description begins] He points to a drop-down button labeled "Marcia Lin QUICK24X7". [Video description ends]

So I'm going to choose EastAdmins.

[Video description begins] The Access Panel Groups web page opens. [Video description ends]

But the problem here is that when I go to the EastAdmins group here, it says, This group is not available to join.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Join group" and its corresponding page opens. It includes a list of groups. [Video description ends]

So what's up with this? Well, in order to find out what's up, we need to log in as one of the group owners and edit the group properties here in the Access Panel.

[Video description begins] He opens the Access Panel Applications web page. [Video description ends]

So I've signed in as the owner of the group EastAdmins, Lucas Brenner.

[Video description begins] He points to the Lucas Brenner QUICK24X7 drop-down button. [Video description ends]

So what I'm going to do is click the Groups panel over on the right.

[Video description begins] The Access Panel Groups web page opens. [Video description ends]

And we're going to see that this is a group that is owned by Lucas Berner. It shows up under Groups I own.

[Video description begins] He points to a group called "EastAdmins". [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click to open up that group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the EastAdmins group and its corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

And what I want to do is edit the details. So I'll click Edit details.

[Video description begins] A dialog box labeled "Edit details" opens. [Video description ends]

Notice that the Group policy here says, Only the owner of this group can add members. Well, no wonder users can't request to join the group. I'm going to open this up, and I'm going to either select, This group is open to join for all users, or This group requires owner approval.

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down list box labeled "Group policy" and a drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

So it really depends on the nature of the group and how it's going to be used. Let's say we choose, This group requires owner approval, and I'll choose Update, and it's done.

[Video description begins] The dialog box closes. [Video description ends]

So now we're going to log out, log back in as Marcia Lin. And she's going to request group membership. She's going to try once again for the EastAdmins group. Okay, Marcia Lin is now logged in again, let's go to Groups.

[Video description begins] He opens the Access Panel Application web page and points to the Marcia Lin QUICK24X7 drop-down button. [Video description ends]

And she wants to join a group.

[Video description begins] The Access Panel Groups web page opens. [Video description ends]

So she's going to click Join group. It's going to be EastAdmins.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens. It includes a list of groups. [Video description ends]

This time, we have the option for her to join the group.

[Video description begins] From the list, he selects the EastAdmins group. [Video description ends]

So let's click the Join group button.

[Video description begins] A dialog box labeled "Join EastAdmins" opens. [Video description ends]

May I please join. And I'll click the Request button.

[Video description begins] He enters the text "May I please join" in a text box labeled "Business justification (required). [Video description ends]

So a request is then going to be made available for group owners, and they have to approve it.

[Video description begins] A pop-up box appears, with the text "Your request has been sent to the owner of the group". [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click OK.

[Video description begins] The pop-up box closes. [Video description ends]

As you might guess, we're going to log out from Marcia Lin and log in as Lucas Brenner. And check out that request.

[Video description begins] He opens the Access Panel Applications web page and points to the Lucas Brenner QUICK24X7 drop-down button. [Video description ends]

Okay, we are in as Lucas Brenner. Well, first thing I noticed is I've got a notification here.

[Video description begins] He clicks an icon labeled "Notifications" and a notification appears. [Video description ends]

Marcia Lin requested to join "EastAdmins", "May I please join". You can either Approve or Deny it. At the same time, Lucas Brenner if you just notice that might be able to go into Groups, well, he can go into Groups.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Groups option and its corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

And here he'll see EastAdmins, and when he's here, he'll see that Jen Hill is still a member.

[Video description begins] He clicks the EastAdmins group and its corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

And that now this group is set to require owner approval, but that's about it. So, if we go back up to the notification area, let's click Approve and see how this changes. So we'll click Approve.

[Video description begins] A pop-up box opens with the text "Are you sure you want to approve the following request?". [Video description ends]

We'll just go back, and we're going to open up the EastAdmins group once again.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

And now we can see Marcia Lin is now a member. So, all of this was done, really, between the user that wanted to join the group and the group owner or owners. It did not involve the help desk.

Bulk Add and Remove Group Members

[Video description begins] Topic title: Bulk Add and Remove Group Members. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In Azure, you can perform a bulk user import to create user accounts in your Azure AD tenant. You can also do the same thing to populate a group with members. Let's take a look at that.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Quick24×7 blade is open. [Video description ends]

So here in the portal, I'm in my Azure AD tenant, and I'm going to go to the Groups view.

[Video description begins] He highlights "Quick24×7" in the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

What I want to do is I want to import users as a member of a group.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So, for example, let's create a new group to do this to, so we start fresh with no members in it.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "New group" and the New Group blade opens. [Video description ends]

Not that you have to do that, but that's what I'm doing. I'm going to call this Group2.

[Video description begins] He enters the text "Group2" in the Group name text box. [Video description ends]

It's going to be Assigned, which means that we manually add members to the group as opposed to creating dynamic rules.

[Video description begins] He points to the Membership type drop-down list box, in which the Assigned option is preselected. [Video description ends]

And I'm not going to add members or anything, I'm just going to create the group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Membership type drop-down list box and a drop-down list opens. He then points to the Dynamic User option. [Video description ends]

So we've got a group here called Group2.

[Video description begins] He points to the No members selected link and then clicks a button labeled "Create". The New group blade closes. A new row is added in the table. [Video description ends]

When I go into that group and when I go to view the Members of the group, of course, there will be none.

[Video description begins] In the new row, he clicks a row entry labeled "Group2" under the Name column header and a blade called "Group2" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

However, we do have an Import members button at the top which I'll click.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Members" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

The first thing you can do is download a csv template, then populate it and re-upload it here.

[Video description begins] A corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

I've already downloaded and added some entries, let me show you that csv file.

[Video description begins] He points to a field labeled "Upload your csv file". [Video description ends]

So I've downloaded and renamed that file and I've opened it in Excel.

[Video description begins] He opens a file called "Azure_BulkGroupMemberImport.csv" in the Excel window. [Video description ends]

Now if you're opening it in Excel, for example, make sure you go to your File menu and save it as a csv file. You don't want it saved as an XLS file. So the only thing you have to do is specify either the member object ID or the user principal name. Here I've added the user principal names or email addresses. These are for users that already exist in Azure AD. We're not creating them, they're already there.

[Video description begins] In the file, he points to cell entries labeled "jhill@quick24×7test.onmicrosoft.com" and "lbrenner@quick24×7test.onmicrosoft.com". [Video description ends]

We're just adding them as members, in this case, ultimately of Group2. Back here in the portal, step three, Upload your csv file.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Microsoft Azure portal. [Video description ends]

That's what I need to do. I need to specify that file here. And it says File uploaded successfully.

[Video description begins] He uploads the Azure_BulkGroupMemberImport.csv file. [Video description ends]

If there was a problem with the contents of that file or its format or anything you'd get a red message here, you wouldn't miss it. So I'm going to go ahead and Submit this. And it says Click here to view the status of each operation.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled “Submit”. [Video description ends]

Sure, okay, let's track the progress and see what's up. So looks like it completed with no errors. We can see its date and timestamp.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Click here to view the status of each operation" and its corresponding page opens in the Group2 blade. The page includes a table with two rows and several columns. He then points to a row entry under a column header labeled "Completion time". [Video description ends]

So therefore, that should mean if we go back to look at the Members, there should be members here.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects the Members option and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Now if they're not, don't sweat it, might just take a moment. You might have to Refresh and click on something else and come back.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Refresh" and the page refreshes. [Video description ends]

But eventually you will see the members of the group.

[Video description begins] In the navigation pane, he selects an option labeled "Owners" and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. He then selects the Members option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. The page now includes two members. A message appears with the text "Bulk operation Azure_BulkGroupMemberImport.csv Succeeded". [Video description ends]

And sure enough, after a moment, we see our users Jen Hill and Lucas Brenner.

Azure AD Android Device Join

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure AD Android Device Join. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In this demonstration, we're going to join my Android smartphone to Azure AD. So in the Settings on my phone, I'm going to scroll down and go into Accounts. And once I've tapped on Accounts, I'm going to click or tap Add account. And then I'm going to scroll down to the bottom of that list and tap Work account. Then I see the Workplace Join screen. So if I scroll down a little bit there, I then have the option of specifying a username and a password. I'll start by putting in the email address of an Azure AD account. So now I've got the full email address specified for that Azure AD user.

[Video description begins] He enters the e-mail address "lbrenner@quick24×7test.onmicrosoft.com". [Video description ends]

So the next thing I'll do after I verify that that's correct is tap Join. At which point I'm going to be prompted, as you might guess, for the Password for that account which I will enter. And then I'll tap Sign in. And we can see it's joining your workplace is what it says. So it's registering the device with Azure AD. It then wants to use a certificate for authentication and it asks for the certificate name. I'll accept the default name. And it now says Microsoft work account is installed, certificate installation is successful. 

[Video description begins] He opens the Microsoft Azure portal. In the portal, the Devices blade is open. In the navigation pane, the All devices option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And I can see down at the bottom, where workplace joined with that Azure AD user account.

[Video description begins] He points to the Devices blade. [Video description ends]

Now I have the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on this device.

[Video description begins] He points to the new row in the table. [Video description ends]

And what I want to do here is just verify that my Quick24x7test Azure AD tenant is showing here.

[Video description begins] He opens the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

And I can even Enable 2-step verification for this account. And so now here in the portal, when I navigate to my Azure AD tenant and go to the Devices view, we can see that we've got a new Android device.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Security" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Getting started" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

It's a motorolaMoto X Play device that has been registered here by user Lucas Brenner with my Azure AD tenant.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Conditional Access" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Policies" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Now this feeds well into configuring things such as conditional access policies where you want to limit access to apps based on the type of device being used.

[Video description begins] In the page, he clicks a button labeled "New policy" and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

For example, if I were to go back to our Azure AD tenant, let's say I went down and clicked on Security, and then I clicked on Conditional Access.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Conditions" opens. [Video description ends]

So within here, I might create a New policy.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Device platforms" opens. [Video description ends]

And one of the things I might specify is the conditions.

[Video description begins] He sets a toggle button labeled "Configure" to "Yes".[Video description ends]

You click on Conditions here, where I would specify the platform that I want to allow. So here, I might choose Device platforms, and over on the far right, notice that when I configure that, I could select, in this case, the Android platform.

[Video description begins] He selects a radio button labeled "Select device platforms" and then selects a checkbox labeled "Android". [Video description ends]

So there are plenty of centralized configuration benefits to joining or registering devices with Azure AD.

Dynamic Device Groups

[Video description begins] Topic title: Dynamic Device Groups. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

Once you start registering devices to your Azure AD tenant, you can then think about creating dynamic device groups. Here in my Azure AD tenant in the portal,

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Devices blade is open. In the navigation pane, the All devices option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

I've already navigated to the Devices view. Where I can see I have an Android as well as a Windows device that are registered.

[Video description begins] In the table, he points to row entries labeled "Android" and "Windows" under a column header labeled "OS". [Video description ends]

So let's go back to our Azure AD tenant because we want to create a dynamic device group.

[Video description begins] He opens the Quick24×7 blade. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click the Groups view. I see existing groups.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All groups option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

I'm going to click the New Group button up at the top.

[Video description begins] He points to the rows in the table. [Video description ends]

Now, a dynamic group means that you create rules which consist of one or more expressions.

[Video description begins] The New Group blade opens. [Video description ends]

Essentially looking at the properties of a device to determine whether or not it should be a member of the group. So I'm going to create a group here called Android Devices.

[Video description begins] He enters the text "Android Devices" in the Group name text box. [Video description ends]

It's going to be a Security group as opposed to an Office 365 group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Group type drop-down list box and the drop-down list opens. He then points to the Security and Office 365 options. He then selects the Security option. [Video description ends]

And instead of Assigned, I want the membership type to be Dynamic Device.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Membership type drop-down list box and the drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

So you can have a Dynamic User group or a Dynamic Device group. But you can't have one group containing both users and devices.

[Video description begins] He selects the Dynamic Device option. [Video description ends]

So Dynamic Device. I can also select an owner just like it can for a normal statically assigned member type of group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the No owners selected link and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to specify someone as the owner.

[Video description begins] He selects a user called "Codey Blackwell" and it appears under a section labeled "Owners". He then clicks a button labeled "Select" and the blade closes. The No owners selected link changes to "1 owner selected. [Video description ends]

And then of course, the key here is to add a dynamic query.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Add dynamic query" and the Dynamic membership rules blade opens. [Video description ends]

Now that takes me into my Dynamic membership rules page, where I start by selecting a Property.

[Video description begins] In the first row, he clicks the Choose a Property drop-down list box under the Property column header and the drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

Now what I'm looking at here are the properties, not of users, but rather of devices that are registered with my Azure AD tenant. So I can see, for example, deviceOSType.

[Video description begins] In the drop-down list, he selects an option labeled "deviceOSType". [Video description ends]

I can choose an Operator such as Equals. And I can Add a value. So we can also take a look at what some of those values might look like by going into the properties of a registered device.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Choose a Property drop-down list box and the drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

Let's do that. Let's open up another window here. So I'm going to right-click on my existing browser tab and Duplicate it.

[Video description begins] The Groups blade opens in the new tab. [Video description ends]

And basically, I'm just going to navigate back to my Devices view so we can check out what some of those values might look like.

[Video description begins] The Home page opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to go here, back to Home, going to go back into Azure, and I'm going to go into my Devices.

[Video description begins] In the Home page, he selects the Azure Active Directory option and the Quick24×7 blade opens. [Video description ends]

And let's pick on the Android device that we saw that was registered here.

[Video description begins] The Devices blade opens. In the navigation pane, the All devices option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click on that device. And that's going to open up the properties for it.

[Video description begins] In the table, he clicks a row entry labeled "motorolaMoto X Play" under the Name column header and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

So for example, we can see the OS is Android. So we can get a sense here of what these properties and their values might look like.

[Video description begins] He points to several properties. [Video description ends]

So having that information, the deviceOStype here, I'm going to say Equals, Android.

[Video description begins] He switches to the tab in which the Dynamic membership rules blade is open. [Video description ends]

Now I could continue adding expressions.

[Video description begins] He enters the text "Android" in a text box under a column header labeled "Value". [Video description ends]

So it keeps adding multiple expressions or lines to this rule.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Add expression" and a new row is added in the table. The code "(device.deviceOSType -eq "Android")" appears in the Rule syntax text box. [Video description ends]

And I can chain each expression together using And, I can also specify Or.

[Video description begins] In the new row, he clicks a drop-down list box under the And/Or column and the drop-down list opens. [Video description ends]

And, of course, would mean that in this case, both conditions, or if you have more, the conditions must evaluate to being true all of them before the device shows up as a member of the group. Or means optional. They don't all have to be true at the same time. So I'm going to click the garbage can to remove the second expression. I only want the first one.

[Video description begins] The new row is removed. [Video description ends]

And notice down below in the Rule syntax, in parentheses, it's written out device.deviceOSType -eq for equals and in quotes, "Android". I'm going to go ahead and click Save and I'm going to Create this group.

[Video description begins] The Dynamic membership rules blade closes. [Video description ends]

Now, depending how many items are registered with your Azure AD tenant may determine how long it takes for the members to show up.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Create button and the New Group blade closes. A new row is added in the table., [Video description ends]

So there's the Android Devices Dynamic group.

[Video description begins] In the new row, he points to a row entry labeled "Android Devices" under the Name column header. [Video description ends]

But if I go into that group and go to Members, if I don't see the members I think should appear in that group immediately, I should go back to the Overview blade for this group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Android Devices row entry and its corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Because currently Membership processing status, Membership last updated, we don't see anything. It takes time initially.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Members option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes the text "No members have been found". [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to kind of click back and forth between Members and Overview here every couple of minutes until I start seeing some information that states that it's actually begun initial processing of group membership.

[Video description begins] He selects the Overview option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And after a minute or so, under the Overview blade, I can see that the Membership processing status says, Update complete. And there's a date and time stamp of when the membership of this group was last updated. Let's go look at the Members. I'm going to click Members over on the left.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens in the content pane. A new member is added. [Video description ends]

And what we should see is that our Motorola X Play device has been added as a member of the group.

Conditional Access

[Video description begins] Topic title: Conditional Access. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

As the name implies, conditional access in Azure AD requires certain conditions to be satisfied before allowing access. Such as from a particular device with a specific user logging in trying to access, let's say a specific enterprise app defined in Azure AD. Let's take a look at how that might work. So we're going to create a conditional access policy using the portal. So I'm going to start in the portal by going to my Azure AD tenant.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the portal, the Home page is open. He clicks the Azure Active Directory option and the Quick24×7 blade opens. [Video description ends]

And I'm going to scroll down in the navigation bar for my tenant, all the way down to Security.

[Video description begins] The Security blade opens. [Video description ends]

When I get to Security, then in the navigation bar at this level, I'm going to click Conditional Access.

[Video description begins] The Conditional Access blade opens. In the navigation pane, the Policies option is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. The page includes a list of policies. [Video description ends]

And then that will pull up the Conditional Access blade.

[Video description begins] He points to the options in the navigation pane. [Video description ends]

So I have a number of other settings. And on the right, I can see some standard baseline policies.

[Video description begins] He points to the list of policies. [Video description ends]

But what we're going to do here is click the New policy button up at the top.

[Video description begins] The New blade opens. [Video description ends]

And what I'm going to call this is a Windows 10 policy. 

[Video description begins] In a text box labeled "Name", he enters the text "Win10". [Video description ends]

So I'll call it Win10 for Windows 10 devices, and I have to specify any users or groups to which this will apply.

[Video description begins] Under a section labeled "Assignments", he selects an option labeled "Users and groups" and a blade called "Users and groups" opens. [Video description ends]

Now when I go to do that, it can be None, it can be All Users, I can select specific users or groups, I can also Exclude. So for example, if I choose All users, I might Exclude admins. In this case, I'm going to choose Select users and groups. And I'm going to choose Users and groups. I could also specify roles or specify that guests and external users are affected by this conditional access policy. I don't want that though.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Select" opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to Users and groups. Go down and click Select. And I'm going to choose one of my Azure AD users, Lucas Brenner.

[Video description begins] He types the text "lu" in a search box and the search result displays a user called "Lucas Brenner". He selects the user and it appears in a section labeled "Selected items". [Video description ends]

Who happens to be the owner that registered a Windows 10 device to the domain. 

[Video description begins] The Select blade closes. The Lucas Brenner user appears under an option labeled "Select" in the Users and groups blade. [Video description ends]

So I'll get to click Select, that takes care of the user. So I'll click Done for that part.

[Video description begins] The Users and groups blade closes. [Video description ends]

Next on the left, what cloud apps or actions do we want this policy applied to?

[Video description begins] In the New blade, he selects an option labeled "Cloud apps or actions" in the Assignments section and a blade called "Cloud apps or actions" opens. [Video description ends]

Well, I'm not too interested in User actions.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "User actions" under a label called "Select what this policy applies to" and a checkbox appears. [Video description ends]

We can see here there's Register security information, which is a preview option.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "Cloud apps" under the Select what this policy applies to label and three radio buttons appear. [Video description ends]

But cloud apps allows us to determine which cloud apps should be accessible or not.

[Video description begins] An option labeled "Select" appears. [Video description ends]

Depending on how we further configure the policy for Windows 10 devices and specifically for this user, Lucas Brenner. 

[Video description begins] He clicks the Select option and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to choose Select apps, and I'll go through and I'll select, let's say, it could be anything, but let's say Office 365.

[Video description begins] He selects a checkbox labeled "Office 365 (preview)" and it appears in a section labeled "Selected items" in the blade. [Video description ends]

So these are apps in Azure AD. Okay, so I'm going to click Done on that.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Select" and the blade closes. In the Cloud apps or actions blade, an app labeled "Office 365 (preview)" appears under the Select option. [Video description ends]

I'm going to click Conditions on the left.

[Video description begins] The Cloud apps or actions blade closes. [Video description ends]

Now, we have to specify some conditions that need to be satisfied.

[Video description begins] In the New blade, he selects an option labeled "Conditions" and a blade called "Conditions" opens. [Video description ends]

I'm interested in Device platforms because I've got a Windows 10 device joined to Azure AD. So I'm going to click Device platforms, and we've got numerous options here.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Device platforms" opens. [Video description ends]

So for configure, I'll choose Yes, that makes these options below available.

[Video description begins] He points to several options. [Video description ends]

I want to choose the specific device platform this applies to.

[Video description begins] He selects a radio button labeled "Select device platforms". Under the radio button, several device platform options are listed. [Video description ends]

It's not Android, it's not iOS or anything like that. It's Windows. So I'm going to select Windows. I'll click Done.

[Video description begins] The Device platforms blade closes. [Video description ends]

I could add multiple other conditions, perhaps that the device must be coming from a specific location based on the IP address range used.

[Video description begins] In the Conditions blade, he points to several options. [Video description ends]

Also got a Device state (Preview) option here that we can take a look here.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "Device state (Preview) and a blade called "Device state (Preview)" opens. [Video description ends]

So we can specify that we want device states to be compliant with certain security baselines. I'm not going to configure that option.

[Video description begins] He selects an option labeled "Yes" under a label called "Configure" and then points to a radio button labeled "All device state", which is preselected. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to remove that.

[Video description begins] He closes the Device state (Preview) blade and a pop-up box appears with the text "Your unsaved edits will be discarded". [Video description ends]

So we've just got really our device platform here.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "OK" and the blade closes. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go ahead and click Done for the conditions.

[Video description begins] In the Conditions blade, he points to an option labeled "Device platforms". [Video description ends]

Now we haven't decided if all of these conditions if they're met either allows or blocks access to something.

[Video description begins] The Conditions blade closes. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go to the access controls Grant section. And I'm going to Grant access, but I want to Require multi-factor authentication.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Grant" opens. He then points to a radio button labeled "Grant access", which is preselected. [Video description ends]

So before Lucas Brenner can use a Windows 10 device and sign in and access Office 365, he's got to use multi-factor authentication.

[Video description begins] He selects a checkbox labeled "Require multi-factor authentication". [Video description ends]

Otherwise, no go. And I'm okay with that.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Select" and the Grant blade closes. [Video description ends]

So that's my policy, I'm going to go ahead and click Create and we can now see we've got our Win10 policy that was created.

[Video description begins] The New blade closes and a new policy labeled "Win10" is added in the list. [Video description ends]

Now notice that the default State is set to Off. Well, that's not very good. If we go into that.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Win10 policy and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

That's the option in the bottom left that you'll see, while either when you go in after the fact or when you're creating it. The Enable policy option is set to Off, it can also be set to Report-only or On. So, once we know we want this to be put into effect, we would click On. And now it says down below, conditional access supports all client apps, that's fine. I'm going to go ahead and click Save. And after we've done this, notice the state for that policy is now On.

[Video description begins] The blade closes. [Video description ends]

So it will now be in effect.
