                    Additional Material Course Notes Part 35


Azure Invoices
  - While the use of cloud computing can mean less capital expenditures for IT services
    - Such as, not having to acquire a lot of on-premises physical computing hardware
    - We still have to be able to track charges in the cost on a per-use basis by reviewing invoices
    - So to get started here in the Azure portal, we are going to click on Subscriptions.
  - The subscription of course is tied to an Azure AD tenant which is shown here as being Quick24x7
    - Our subscription is called Pay-As-You-Go, so go ahead and click on it to open up this navigation bar 
    - Which will give us options related to our subscription.
    - One of which, if we scroll down under Billing, is Invoices.
  - We can see on the right that we have the Last 3 months worth of invoices shown. We can see the Billing Periods, starting and ending
    - We can see the date of the invoice and we can also see the Amount
    - We can see the Type, in this case it's for Azure Services
    - We also, if we scroll to the right, have the option of downloading each of these
    - If we click on the download link, it's a CSV file format download or it could be a PDF.
  - This could be important for accounting reasons and certainly for business expense or taxation reasons
    - This is something that we can do by looking at the invoices
    - But notice also that each of these specific dollar amounts for each invoice is a hyperlink, it's blue.
  - If we were to click directly on it, we could actually jump into the Cost analysis for that particular invoice.
    - We can see for example, looks like premium solid state drive or ssd managed disks
    - Were really the bulk of the cost for that particular invoice within that time frame.
  - Followed by, it looks like, virtual machines, we can see how this breaks down and we can even filter it.
    - If we want to click on Filter items, we could start typing things in and then filtering based on that.
    - For example, if we put in ssd, all we're doing now is looking at SSD charges related to the time frame listed up above.
  - We are just going to go ahead and click the X to close out of that
    - It's one thing to come here and view the invoices
    - But we want to try to avoid having to do things in the sense of thinking of doing it
    - We want to automate things and we can click the Email Invoice option up at the top.
  - Currently it says, You are not receiving emailed invoices, that is something that we want to do
    - So we are going to click on Opt In to make that happen.
    - We acknowledge that it's going to be sent via non-encrypted email, that's fine so hit Agree.
  - This could be an important aspect of your configuration when it comes to having your invoices emailed to you automatically
    - The other thing to think about is we have this Access Invoice button up at the top, this is currently On.
  - It would apply for example to users in your subscription that would have roles such as the the billing reader role, we have that option available as well.
    - Notice that the default here, Timespan is listed as being 3 months. But you can click on that and change it.
    - For example, we can set it to the Last year if that's what we want to see.
    - And sure enough, we now see our invoices for the Last year.


Azure Resource Groups and the Portal
  - In Microsoft Azure, a resource group is a way to organize related resources together
    - Such as creating a resource group for a web application and deploying 
    - All of the underlying resources that make that web app work within the resource group
    - Or maybe creating a resource group for a department
    - And when that department in the organization deploys resources, they deploy them into that resource group
    - Or you might do it for a project, either way, it allows us to track billing for resources in that resource group
    - It also allows us to track usage of items or see deployments within that resource group.
  - In the portal, let's get started by creating a resource group, we're going to do that by beginning within the Resource groups view
    - In the upper left, open up the navigator and click Resource groups.
    - You're going to see any existing resource groups, you'll see any subscriptions that they may be tied to, and their geographical location.
    - If you click on a specific resource group and open up its properties blade, you'll be able to see things like Tags, you could tag it.
  - You can also see any deployments that were made into that resource group and the state of them, whether they succeeded or whether they failed. 
    - You can also even see Cost analysis and Cost alerts and Budgets per resource group, so at the resource group level.
    - However, in this case, we're going to create a new resource group, so back here at the main Azure portal page, click Create a resource.
  - From here, we are just going to search for resource group, and there it is, Resource group
    - So go ahead and click the Create button, and then we have to fill in a few little details.
    - Basically we have to give it a name and specify the region where we want to create it.
    - Of course, tie it to a particular Subscription, of which we have only one, the Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
  - We are going to call this Rg2, Resource group 2, and it's going to be, let's see, in a different location
    - We are doing that because we know that most of my resources will be deployed in that same type of region, then click next for tags.
    - We could specify a tag key and value pair. For example, if this is going to be tied to a project
    - Then we can specify a Project and a Value, let's say project ABC.
  - Bear in mind, depending on how you plan on using this, you might just name the resource group project ABC, so really depends how you want to use it.
    - At any rate, we are going to click the next button, validation is passed
    - Then we are going to click Create, and after a moment it will create our resource group.
    - We are going to click the Go to resource group link.
  - Well, actually, before we do that, let's go back to the Resource groups view, just to shows up there.
    - We know it will, so we just have to, click Refresh, maybe a few times, and wait a moment 
    - Then we'll see resource group show up, resource group 2, Rg2 show up.
    - We can click on it and then start to explore it.
  - Of course, it's not really being used at this point, you could go under Deployments 
    - You would see that there's no deployments that have been sent here because it's newly created
    - But when you deploy new resources, for example, go to the All resources view, not that we have to do it this way, but we can
  - If we were to click the Add button, let's say we want to add a virtual machine, Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.
    - Part of that deployment is going to be specifying the resource group into which we want to deploy it.
    - We can see that we've got a drop-down list here for resource groups, and we could specify the Resource group
    - In this case, Rg2, where we want this resource deployed.


Azure Resource Groups and the CLI
  - We are going to use the Azure CLI to manage Azure resource groups.
    - First inn the portal, we've navigated to the Resource groups view where we can see, we currently have two resource groups.
  - If we click on any one of them to open them up
    - We could click on Deployments to open up that blade to see any items that were deployed into that resource group
    - This would be whether it Succeeded or whether it failed.
    - We can even perform a Cost analysis against the resource deployments inside of this resource group and so on.
    - Go to the CLI and start managing resource groups, the first thing we'll do is run az group -h.
    - On help, we are working with resource groups.
  - It does say here that this allows us to Manage resource groups and template deployments
    - The next thing we are going to do is get the next level command, which in this case to create a resource group would be create, so az group create
    - If we need more help, we can run az group create -h to learn more about any parameters 
    - That we might need to pass on the command line to work with this, such as --location or -l to specify the location or the region.
  - It even says, if you want to know how to type in those items, you could see the values by typing in az account list-locations
    - Of course, we'll have to specify the name and so on, so clear the screen with cls and we are going to do this
    - We are going to run az group create -l for location, in our location and we will call this resource group -n Rg2.
  - After we've done that, we should get some returned JSON output which is indicative of the fact the provisioning succeeded, which it says it did
    - We are going to go ahead and run az group to list our resource groups.
