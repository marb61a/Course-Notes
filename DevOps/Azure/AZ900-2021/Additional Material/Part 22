Azure AD Role Overview
  - Now we can assign roles, whether they're built in or custom at a variety of levels within the hierarchy in Azure
    - But before we get to that, let's talk about which principals we can assign it to
    - You can assign roles to users individually, but it's normally easier to do it on a group level
    - You just add members to the group, they get the permissions for the roles assigned to the group
    - You could also do it for service principles, think of a service principle as being kind of a dummy user account used by software
    - It's not actually user logging in, it's a software component that might require access, let's say, to some other resource like a storage account
  - Then you've got managed identities, this is something this is a built in type of security principle that's managed automatically by Azure
    - This would be used for example, if you're a software developer, you building custom solutions in Azure that need to authenticate to certain Azure services
    - So depending on what you're working with, will determine whether Azure creates the managed identity or not, let's say that we've assigned a role to a group
  - Where does that apply in the Azure hierarchy? we can assign that at the subscription level
    - Which means that the group members would have those permissions from the role for everything in the entire subscription
    - It flows down through the hierarchy down to resource groups and down to individual resources in resource groups
    - However, you could also assign RBAC roles to a specific resource group
    - Naturally those permissions would only apply for resources in the resource group
    - If you need to be very granular, you can also assign it to a specific resource
    - Let's say you need to allow a virtual machine login for a group for one particular virtual machine
    - You can certainly do that by assigning the scope for that particular virtual machine resource.


Azure AD Role Portal Assignment
  - You can use the Azure Portal to assign roles and also to view where the roles are effective. 
    - We're talking about Role-Based Access Control, or RBAC
    - To get started in the portal search for subscription, and go to the subscription level, because we want to start by applying a role there
  - Then we can examine how those permissions flow down the hierarchy
    - That means to resource groups within the subscription and within resource groups to individual resources, start by opening up a subscription
  - When you want to assign RBAC roles, regardless of which level you're doing it at
    - You always go into the properties of the item, in this case, the Subscription
    - In the navigation bar, you click on Access control (IAM)
    - From here, you'll be able to see any role assignments.
    - You can choose to View role assignments.
  - If we click View, we can see that listed over here on the right, but we can also +Add role assignments
    - So we are going to click +Add, Add a role assignment, the first thing we need to do is select the appropriate Role.
  - We can choose from the alphabetical list of role names
    - Bear in mind that a role is really just a collection of related permissions
    - What we are going to do is type in the word virtual just to filter this out
    - We'll see here we've got a Virtual Machine Contributor role, which allows with the creation of virtual machines and management of them
    - We are going to leave that as the Role.
  - We can assign the access to Azure AD users, groups, or service principals.
    - What we are going to do here is take a look for a group by the name of east
    - Sure enough, we have an existing Azure AD group that we created previously called EastAdmins
    - We want to assign this role to that group. So EastAdmins is now showing up down below as a selected member.
    - We are then going to save that.
  - At this point, we want to check our work right here at this level, at the subscription level
    - We are just going to scroll over a little bit to the right so we can kind of see everything, including our scroll bar
    - At the subscription level, notice for the Virtual Machine Contributor role, EastAdmins is part of that
    - We can see that that is a Group and that it was assigned at the Scope of This resource.
    - Why don't we take a look at a resource group somewhere within the Subscriptions.
  - For that we are just going to go to Home and open up the navigation bar on the left, and just choose Resource groups.
    - We are going to open up the properties of an existing Resource group.
    - We know that to get to the RBAC portion of that item, we need to click on Access control (IAM), so do that
  - We don't want to make a role assignment here, what we want to do is View role assignments, so click the View button
    - We are just going to scroll over just a little bit so we can see what's happening here.
    - Scroll down, notice that EastAdmins has the Virtual Machine Contributor role that is effective here in the resource group
    - However, it says Inherited, and it was inherited from the Subscription level
    - So why don't we go into an object within this resource group to take a peek.
  - For example, if we click on Overview here for the resource group
    - One of the things we'll be able to do is see the resources down below that are in that resource group
    - It doesn't matter which one we pick, we are just going to click on this network security group to open it up.
    - As is the case with what we've been looking at so far to get to the RBAC section, we click Access control (IAM), so this is for an individual resource.
  - View the role assignments over on the right, and we'll see, of course, that Virtual Machine Contributor EastAdmins 
    - Is shown here with inheritance coming from the Subscription level.
    - That's all that we need to do to be able to grant permissions to Azure resources through the use of roles in the portal.


Azure AD Role CLI Assignment
  - RBAC roles can be assigned using the Azure CLI.
    - In the portal I'm going to click on Cloud Shell to start up the CLI, and I'm going to start by creating a role assignment using az role assignment create.
  - The first thing we have to do is specify the name of the role that I want to grant, in this case --role and in quotes, "SQL DB contributor"
    - We then have to determine who the assignee is with the --assignee parameter who you assigning this to
    - It could be a service principle and Azure AD group, in this case, it's an Azure AD user, specifically jhill
    - Then we've got the full email address or user name of that account
    - We want to make sure that the SQL DB contributor role is assigned to jhill
    - We want the scope to be a resource group, so --resource-group, and Rg1. Could go ahead and press Enter to create that role assignment.
    - It looks like it's good. We've got some returned JSON, and we can check our work here in the portal. Let's just minimize this.
    - Go into the Rg1 Resource group to see if user J Hill is shown there with the SQL DB Contributor role.
    - We are going to go to Access control (IAM) for Rg1.
  - What we want to do in there is View the role assignments, so go ahead and click on that, scroll over a little bit and have a look
    - Sure enough their SQL DB Contributor and Jen Hill is a member of that role at this level
    - This resource. It wasn't inherited from the subscription, so let's go back into the CLI.
  - We can also view assignments from within here, of course as you might imagine
    - So az role assignment list --, let's say resource group rg1 since that's what we just looked at in the portal
    - We can see here that user principalName J Hill is assigned here.
  - We can also see that the roleDefinitionName is SQL DB Contributor
    - This is for the resource group of course Rg1 that we asked for, up above in the command line.
    - We can also remove role assignments from here as well.
  - To do that we would use the az role assignment delete command syntax
    - We need to specify the assignee, so --assignee, and it's going to be the user we just added here in this example, jhill
    - We have to specify the role because she might be assigned with multiple roles at that level, so --role SQL DB Contributor
    - And the scope where that was applied, that I want to remove it from, is the Rg1 resource group, press Enter
    - That's now going to remove that role assignment.
    - We are just going to use the up arrow key, back to where we were listing role assignments for resource group 1, or Rg1
    - Notice that now nothing is returned.


Azure AD Role PowerShell Assignment
  - PowerShell cmdlets can be used to manage RBAC role assignments.
    - In the portal we are going to launch the Cloud Shell to access those PowerShell cmdlets.
