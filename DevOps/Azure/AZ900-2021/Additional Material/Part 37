Resource Group Deployments
  - You can view past resource deployments into an Azure resource group by opening up its properties in the portal
    - To start with, let's go to the Resource groups view where we're going to see the resource groups within this subscription.
    - For example, Rg1, resource group 1. If we click to open that resource group in the Overview blade
    - We'll see any resources currently deployed in that resource group.
  - Here it says there are No resources to display, if we click on the Deployments item in the navigation bar
    - We can see that there have been deployments to this resource group in the past
    - Either those resources were deleted, or they were moved to another resource group.
    - Close this resource group for a moment and let's go into our second resource group here called Rg3.
    - Again in the Overview part of that, we do see there is an active object here within this resource group. It's a storage account.
    - In the same way, if we go to the Deployments part, we'll see see that there are no deployments listed to this.
  - Well, how can that be when we can see there's a storage account currently assigned to Rg3? 
    - That would be because it must have been moved from another one
    - So let's go back into our initial resource group, Rg1, let's go the Deployments section.
  - Here we can see that there was a template deployment for one or more resources
    - We don't quite know yet, into this resource group on a specific date and time.
    - If we click on the link for that template, we can actually Download the details related to that template, it's a zip file.
  - We are just going to choose Open to open it up directly, and it going to open up the deployment.json file
    - This gives you the details about what in that template was deployed to the resource group.
  - Unless we scroll down through here, it looks like it was a storage account, that looks like the only thing that was deployed here
    - We can learn that quite easily by viewing that information.
    - What's equally interesting about that, if we go back here to the Deployments, is if we select an existing deployment.
    - We're here have a deployment of the storage account into this resource group. We have a Redeploy button up at the top.
  - It means what it says, based on the selection, you can deploy that item again
    - You would only do that if it doesn't already exist
    - For example, we are going to click Redeploy, this is what you would normally see if you were deploying from a template.
  - We can select a Resource group where we want to deploy this item
    - For example, Rg3 or we can create a new resource group, whatever the case might be
    - Interestingly, even though it was originally deployed into Rg1, this storage account was moved to another resource group
    - So it doesn't actually exist here anymore, we are going to deploy it back into Rg1
    - What we doing is creating a new storage account from that original deployment
    - We would do that if we want to use a lot of the settings from it as opposed to deploying a brand new storage account from scratch.
  - It's the only reason you would do this, assuming we are okay with all of these settings as per my original deployment
    - Then down at the bottom, we could choose that we agree to the terms and conditions stated above
    - The only thing we'll have to account for though is the name of the storage account
    - If that storage account is still being used somewhere, then the name isn't unique
    - We'll just add a 2, let's say to the end of it, to make sure that the Storage Account Name is unique and choose Purchase.
  - Let's see if it validated, excellent, the deployment is currently in progress
    - What we're doing is redeploying a storage account into this resource group based on a past deployment
    - Of course, the original storage account is no longer here. It's in Rg3
    - After a moment, if we go look at my notification bell icon in the upper right, it looks like the resource deployment succeeded
    - Go back and look at the deployments here for our resource group.
  - Let's take a look at the Overview here where we can see active current items here
    - We can see that there is now a storage account that was deployed into Rg1 and we redeployed it from a past deployment.


Resource Group Cost Analysis
  - In Azure, you can view and track your costs based at the subscription level.
    - For example, here in the portal if we go to our Subscriptions and click on an active subscription
    - When we open it up, we'll have the option of clicking Cost analysis over on the left.
  - Then we'll see all the costs associated with this subscription
    - Of course, we can change the time period or time frame for which that is representative of, but we have the option of doing that
    - But what we're talking about here is doing a cost analysis at the resource group level
    - Think about how you might use a resource group in Azure, you might use it for a project, so you might have a project called Project X
    - You'd create a resource group with that same name and deploy project resources into it
    - That way you have a single unit of management in the resource group and also for tracking costs
  - We are going to go into our Resource groups view here in Azure
    - Then we are going to open up an existing resource group we've got named Rg1, so click on it.
    - What we want to do is scroll down in the navigation bar and click on Cost analysis to open that blade.
  - What's going to happen is we're going to see a cost breakdown for resources deployed only into this resource group
    - We can see it's coming up with the numbers listed here
    - We have our standard charts where we can scroll down below and see it broken down by service
    - It looks like we've got SQL databases eating up the lion share of the cost in this particular case for this time frame and the location 
    - We have all the normal stuff that we would normally see we can even filter
    - We could add a filter here for anything that interests us in such as a specific service type or Service name in this case
    - We could open up the list and choose that we are only interested in sql database.
  - We could filter based only on sql database, then the cost analysis will update to show me only that
    - As usual, we also have the option of exporting, for example, we could choose to Export.
  - Let's see a PNG graphic file, click Download charts, once that's done, just click Open down at the bottom of the screen
    - We can see here it's opened it up in Paint on my machine
    - We essentially have the same type of information that we can see visually directly in the Azure portal
    - Go back and export that as, let's say a, document in the format of Excel
    - We are going to choose Excel and choose Download data, then go ahead and click on Open
    - When you open it in Excel, you're going to have two sheets
    - You could have a worksheet, which is the summary that you're looking at here and also the actual data itself.
  - Not only can we work with our cost analysis at this level at the resource group level
    - But we can also go into Cost alerts over on the left and Add an alert and notification 
    - When the costs for resources deployed into this resource group get to a certain level.
    - We could add a filter but we will just going to leave it on Rg1, don't change the scope and call this Rg1Budgets1.
  - The idea here is that we want to be alerted when costs exceed a certain value
    - We can specify the period, we are going to leave it on Billing month but we could specify quarter here, and so on
    - We are going to set the amount here to 50, as we scroll down
    - We can see here that the max over the past five months has been about $25 specifically in Canadian dollars.
  - It depends on your subscription and how it's configured for the currency, that's been specified
    - Now that we've done that, we are going to go ahead and click on Next> and scroll back up to the top.
  - Basically, we are going to say when we get to 75% of our budgeted amount
    - We want to use an existing Action group if we have any, in order to send a notification
    - If we don't have any existing action groups that are available in the list, then we can click the Manage action group link.
  - Down below, we can also specify an alert recipient email address, such as for a group, which we've specified here, then just click Create.
    - We didn't create an Action Group, we could have, if we wanted as an alternative alert notification method like SMS text or something like that
    - At this point, we now have a budget created, if we go into the Budgets.
    - Portion here, we can see our budget is listed here for the resource group
    - The key is that we can work with cost analysis at the resource group level.
