Azure AD Overview
  - Azure Active Directory is otherwise called Azure AD or sometimes AAD, but it all means the same thing
    - It means that we have an Active Directory instance in the Azure Cloud
    - It's managed so we don't have to set up a server and install the domain, controller, components, and so on
    - What this means is that we have a centralized identity provider in the cloud
    - It can contain users, groups, application registrations, and security principles
    - Security principles are often used to make sure that software components have specific permissions to needed cloud resources
    - You can also link Azure Active Directory to your on-premises Active Directory if you wish
    - There are many configurations such that users authenticate to cloud apps using their familiar on-prem apps
    - And password changes are synchronized between both locations.
  - You can manage Azure Active Directory and everything within it using the GUI
    - Using the portal, you can also use command-line management tools, like PowerShell cmdlets, and the Azure CLI
    - Identity in Access Management or IAM, is all about authentication in authorization
    - Authentication is the proving of identity. Single factor authentication
    - For users for instance, would include items in the same category, such as something you know as a username and password would be
    - It's single factor, but multi-factor meshes categories
    - Username and password fall under the something you know category, but the possession of a smartcard falls under the something you have category
    - Hence, we would have Multifactor Authentication or MFA in that instance.
  - The authorization is controlled access to resources that occurs after successful authentication
    - Such as having the appropriate permissions to a SharePoint site
    - Or perhaps the ability to deploy specific virtual machines only within a specific geographical region
    - It's permissions or policies that get assigned to groups
    - With Identity and Access Management or IAM, we are talking about controlling the authentication 
    - And then the authorization related to users and groups and even devices
    - Such as Windows 10 computers joined to Azure AD, or Android smartphones registered with Azure AD for centralized control
    - We know that IAM also deals with software permissions, specifically in the form of security principles.
  - Azure AD then is a centralized repository of credentials, you could say, among other things
    - There are other security things that we have to consider, like RBAC roles. RBAC stands for Role Based Access Control
    - A role is a collection of related permissions, such as the ability to manage Azure virtual machines
    - We could assign that role to certain users, or groups, that would apply to either the entire subscription in Azure
    - Or a resource group, or just a single virtual machine for that matter
    - Conditional access is an important option, you can build policies that check conditions that must be met before allowing access to something
  - An example is that, if we have a sales associate that needs access to some kind of a Sales Cloud based application
    - Then they can only do that, they can only access it if they sign in using Multifactor Authentication
    - Then we've got access reviews. This is something that you can schedule or run 
    - Whenever you wish to take a look at things like group memberships in Azure AD
    - Or permissions granted to enterprise applications registered in Azure AD
    - Because sometimes these permissions are granted and left, even though they may no longer be required, and that presents a security risk
    - Access reviews are good from a security perspective.
  - Then there's Privileged Identity Management, otherwise called PIM, P-I-M
    - The purpose of PIM is really to only provide administrative access to administrators when they need it
    - You could think of this as, just-in-time or J-I-T, JIT administrative access
    - Of course, we can enable Multifactor Authentication or MFA to enhance user sign in security
    - For instance, instead of Azure AD users only being required to enter a username and password
    - In addition to that, they might have to enter a six-digit PIN that gets texted to their smartphone


Azure AD and the Portal
  - To properly manage Microsoft Azure, it's important to have a clear understanding of the association of an Azure AD tenant and a subscription
    - Now, an Azure AD tenant is essentially an instance of Azure Active Directory in the cloud, where you have users and groups, and devices and so on.
  - You can associate a subscription with a tenant, for example, here in the portal in the upper right along with my sign in information
    - We can see the name of the Azure AD tenant we are currently switched to it's called QUICK24X7.
  - So here, we can click Subscriptions on my screen, we can also search for subscriptions if it wasn't there
    - To view any subscriptions associated with this Azure AD tenant
    - We can see we've got one it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, we are just going to click Home here in the upper left.
  - If we were to view for example, All resources, it takes us to the All resources view 
    - But we have not yet created anything so we don't really see anything, but at least it did take us to the view
    - Now let us switch over to a different Azure AD tenant.
    - We are going to click in the upper right and choose Switch directory, and maybe we'll choose the one by the name of EarthFarm.
    - This is a separate Azure AD tenant or separate instance of Azure AD Directory Services.
  - When we take a look here, we have a different looking screen
    - If we were to try, for example, to look about why don't we start by trying to see which subscriptions are associated with this tenant
    - So when we go to Subscriptions for EarthFarm, there are none although we do have the ability to add one, let us just go back Home.
  - If we were to try to go to the All resources view, well, it just won't let us do it
    - Because you need to at least have a subscription associated with the Azure AD tenant to be able to do anything.
    - Switch back to our active tenant, but when we say that what we really mean is the one that has an associated subscription, that was Quick24x7. 
    - When we look at Quick24x7, we can go to Azure Active Directory from the main screen, we could also search for it and choose it from the resultant list.
  - We could click on my left-hand navigation bar to open it up, and scroll down and choose Azure Active Directory, it doesn't matter
    - But at this point we can start actually doing something meaningful with Azure AD.
    - For example, we could go to the Users view and can see any existing users
    - Or begin creating users, or inviting users, or bulk creating them from a CSV file.
    - We'll just click back on Quick24x7 in the breadcrumb trail in the upper left, we can also view Groups and also Devices.
    - Azure AD then is a centralized cloud-based identity provider that can have one or more Azure subscriptions associated with it.


Azure AD and the CLI
  - While you can use the Azure portal to manage and navigate through your Azure AD tenant, you can also do that using the Azure CLI.
    - In this case in the portal, click the Cloud Shell icon at the top where we are going to run CLI commands.
    - The first thing we are going to do is run az account list and press Enter.
  - The first thing we see is the homeTenantId, so it starts here with 96421
    - As a matter of fact, if we just minimize that, we can see that 96421 is actually the tenant ID for my Azure AD tenant which is named, Quick24x7.
  - We can see that information. As we go further down, we can also see the name of the subscription associated with that Azure AD tenant
    - Because there can be one or more subscriptions.
  - We are going to go ahead and minimize Cloud Shell for a second and search up subscriptions in the bar at the top center here
    - When we do that then we will be able to see which Subscriptions are associated with the Quick24x7 tenant, there's one, it's called Pay-As-You-Go.
    - We can see the Subscription ID for that is 048b82 and so on. Well, let's go back and take a look here.
  - We can also see Pay-As-You-Go is shown here. The state of our subscription is that it's Enabled, okay
    - This looks good, we're getting a bit of information simply from the az account list about our Azure AD tenant
    - We are going to go ahead and just clear the screen with cls and take a look at a few other things that we could do.
    - For example, we are going to run az space ad space -h for help
    - What can we do in Azure Active Directory here from the CLI?
  - We can manage applications that are registered, groups. We can get information about the signed-in-user
    - We can manage service principals which is often used when you have software components that need authorization to resources in Azure
    - Like storage accounts for instance. And we can manage of course Azure AD users
    - If we were to run az ad user -h, tells me the next level commands about users we can work with.
