Azure User MFA (Cont)
  - We are going to specify some details about the phone that we are going to use
    - We'll specify the country or region, the phone number
    - We are going to have it, Send us a code by text message
    - This is going to be the additional Multifactor Authentication factor
    - Go ahead and enter in the six digit code that was texted to the phone, our smartphone number
    - Click Verify and then click Done, at this point it takes us into the Access Panel Application, so we're signed in
    - Let's test this again. Let's sign out from being logged in as Codey and let's try it again from scratch now that MFA is completely set up
    - We are just going to go ahead and Sign out from that account.
  - We are going to sign back in again, same email address for Codey Blackwell
    - We'll put in the password for the account, now it says we've texted your phone with the code
    - You need to enter that to sign in, that's the Multifactor Authentication
    - We are going to put in the code here, then click Verify
    - We don't want to stay signed in, so choose No, after a moment, we are back at the Access Panel Applications screen
    - There are many different mechanisms by which a code like that can be received
    - But in this case, it's just being sent through SMS text.
    - In the portal, looking at the All users view in our Azure AD Tenant, go back into Multi-Factor Authentication
    - Notice now that for user Codey Blackwell, it used to be Enabled, but now it's Enforced.
    - Because that user had signed in since MFA was Enabled.


Azure User MFA Block
  - Multifactor authentication, or MFA, enhances users sign in security by requiring an additional factor besides just username and password
    - However, you can also choose to block MFA user access attempts, to block a user account from authenticating
    - You might do this if you suspect, for example, a user device has been lost or stolen 
    - And you don't want to chance someone being able to log in with that account, or if a user has left the organization
  - So either way, here's what you need to do on the portal to block user MFA
    - Start by going into Azure Active Directory, then in the navigation panel, with the properties for Azure AD, go to Security, within there, then go to MFA.
  - In the Multi-Factor Authentication navigation bar, go to Block/unblock users
    - Currently, there are no Blocked users, it does say here that blocking users simply means they will not receive Multi-Factor Authentication requests
    - It's denied. And it says here, that the user will remain blocked for 90 days by default, unless you unblock them within this list
    - Let's go ahead and add a block, click Add and we have to determine which user we want to add to this list.
  - In this case, it's going to be cblackwell@, and then we'll put in the entire name of the domain for our Azure AD tenant
    - On microsoft.com, in this case, it's using the default suffix
    - The reason here will be Lost smartphone, and at this point, click Ok
    - The user will be added to this list, which means that authentication attempts for MFA by that user will not be honored.
  - We can see the User is now listed here with the reason of Lost smartphone
    - Bear in mind, it can take a little while before this kicks in
    - At any point in time, we can choose to unblock that account
    - We have an Unblock link, instead of waiting for the default 90 day timer
    - We are going to go ahead and click Unblock for that account, and we are going to put in the reason of, Phone was found.
    - Then we'll click Ok, we're unblocking that account so that MFA authentication for that user will now go back to running as normal.


Azure Self-Service Password Reset
  - If you've ever worked in a helpdesk environment, you're probably well aware that a large majority of tickets deal with user password resets.
    - In other words, users forgetting their passwords
    - Luckily, in Azure AD, we have the option of enabling self-service password reset
    - So that the user can take care of that issue themselves without opening a helpdesk ticket
    - To get started here in Azure, go to Azure Active Directory, where we are then going to go into Users.
  - We want to go to the All users view. But really, what we want to do here is enable the Password reset option.
    - In the left-hand navigator, we'll click Password reset
    - Currently, we have to determine which set of users we want this to be available to, currently it's set to None.
  - We can choose Selected, where we can specify groups of users that we want the setting applied to
    - Or we can turn it on, for All users within the organization
    - We are going to choose All and we are going to choose Save
    - After a moment, it will say that the password reset policy has been saved
    - Go ahead and test this out. Let's go back to the Users view
    - We're going to pick on a user here. Let's see, it's going to be Codey Blackwell
    - If we open up Codey Blackwell, we can see the full username, including the DNS suffix for the Azure AD tenant
    - What we're going to do is try to sign in as this user.
  - On purpose, we're going to keep entering in an incorrect password
    - So we're going to behave as a user would if they actually forgot their password
    - We are trying to sign in with that user account, we've got that username specified here and it's asking for the password.
  - In my case, we are connecting to account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/ for that password prompt to pop up
    - The idea is the user would try to enter their password, and it would be incorrect, and so on
    - What we're looking at here is the, reset it now button or link, go ahead and click on reset it now.
  - It knows our User ID because we specified that
    - It asks us to enter the characters in the picture or the words in the audio
    - Depending on whether we want to listen or just type in what we see
    - We will go ahead and type in those characters, then click the Next button
    - We've already enabled MFA on this user account so it already knows my phone number
    - Otherwise it would be prompting me to specify it, basically we've already set up the mobile phone communication alternative method
    - We are then going to go ahead and enter the full phone number down below
    - After that click the Text button, it says, We've sent you a text message containing a verification code, and that has happened.
  - We are going to go ahead and enter it in, after that, click Next. And this is working perfectly
    - It says well, Get back into your account by specifying a new password and then confirming it
    - Of course, there are password rules that must be adhered to, and it talks about strong passwords, and so on and so forth
    - We are going to go ahead and enter one in, then click the Finish button. Okay, it says the password has been reset
    - To sign in with the new password, click here and go ahead and specify that new password just set
    - As per normal, because this account happens to also have MFA or Multifactor Authentication enabled
    - That's why it already knew our phone number, we are going to enter in the MFA code
    - It's business as usual at this point, it liked the password
    - We'll just Verify that we don't want to stay signed in, just like that, we are now signed in
    - The user reset their own password without having to involve the helpdesk.


Azure AD Deleted Users
  - Azure AD user accounts can be removed using command line tools or programmatically through API calls, and also here in the portal.
    - If we were to select a user, for example, would be able to use the buttons across the top to remove that user
    - And we might do that if the user has left the organization.
  - What's interesting is that you have 30 days by default within which you have the option of restoring that account
    - After 30 days, the account is removed permanently automatically
    - Click on Deleted users in the left-hand navigator, because we've already got some users we've removed, one of which has the name of Jen Hill.
    - We can see the Deletion date and time, as well as the Permanent deletion date and time, which is 30 days in the future or 30 days after the Deletion date.
  - We are going to check user Jen Hill, we'll put a checkmark in the box
    - Up at the top, we have a number of options, so we can Delete permanently right now, instead of waiting for the 30 days
    - We can restore this individual user or perform a Bulk restore for more than one user at once, choose Restore user.
  - It asks me, Restore selected users? And we'll click on Yes
    - So user Jen Hill, then, has successfully been restored. We've seen the notification message
    - She's no longer listed in the Deleted users view, if we go back to All users
    - We'll see that user Jen Hill has been reinstated, so her account is back to normal.
  - One of the things we would ask is, what about group memberships?
    - Are they retained when the user is restored? The answer is yes
    - If we go back into user Jen Hill, who's just been restored, and go to the Groups part of her account
    - We'll see any groups that she was a member of previously have been retained, in this case, a group by the name of Group1.
