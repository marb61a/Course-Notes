Azure Policies Overview (Cont)
- We can also specify that a default tag value be applied if it's not been applied by the user
    - Policies can also accept parameter values, this way you don't have to hard-code things like names into the policy itself
    - It lends itself to be modular and reusable, parameter values then can be fed into a policy
    - The policy would have been assigned either to a subscription
    - Which means it flows down to everything in that subscription like resource groups and ultimately resources
    - Also, it could be tied to a specific resource group. It could be tied to a management group
    - A management group is used to organize multiple subscriptions and you can also configure an exclusion
    - So let's say that you've assigned a policy to check for virtual machine disk encryption to the subscription
    - That flows down to everything in that subscription
    - But you might want to exclude a resource group where there are virtual machines used for testing purposes
    - So they don't need their disks to be encrypted
    - You don't want the policy applied there so you could exclude a resource group within the subscription
  - There are a number of Azure Policy effects, such as audit, which is used for logging where it generates a warning or AuditIfNotExists
    - This means that if a resource doesn't exist, then auditing would be enabled
    - DeployIfNotExists, so if a resource doesn't exist, create it and then deny
    - This would be used, for example, to mark non-compliant items as being non-compliant
    - Now, they wouldn't be deleted, they'd just show up as non-compliant
    - Such as our example, of using a policy to check for virtual machine disk encryption
    - So all the machines that are specified as being non-compliant are easily identified
  - Then there's the notion of Azure Policy initiatives which really is essentially a group of policies lumped together
    - Why would we do that? Well, it is because they're related
    - The policy group or initiative then is assigned just as normally would be done, to a subscription, or a resource group, and so on
    - As an example, imagine that we want to be able to harden regional Azure resources
    - So that might be an initiative, then we could organize policies within that that would make that happen
    - Such as to ensure VM disk encryption is enabled. And also ensuring that endpoint protection is enabled
    - So the initiative would contain those two policies in this example. So it's all about, in this case, security compliance.
    - You can manage Azure Policies using the portal, you can also do it using the CLI and using PowerShell cmdlets.


Policy Assignment and the Portal
  - There are many different reasons you would apply policies in an Azure environment
    - Policies either control what other Azure technicians can do
    - Such as limiting where certain types of virtual machines can be deployed in terms of regions
    - Or you might want to check for security compliance for your existing deployed resources
    - To get started, here in the portal, we are going to search for Policy.
    - Then, we are going to click on Policy to open up the Policy area.
  - The first thing we want to do is just take a look at some existing policy Definitions.
    - There are plenty of pre-built or built-in definitions, you could also build your own
    - They're all listed here, but we can filter them such as by type, whether it's custom or built-in, or by category
    - For example, if we deselect everything here, and choose let's say, Network, then we see policies related only to networking
    - Or of course, we could select everything in terms of category, and then filter by words, such as the word encrypt
    - For example, here we see, we've got options for checking whether or not disk encryption should be applied on virtual machines
    - That is actually what we're going to do here.
  - Under the Assignments view on the left, we'll see any policies that were assigned to part of the Azure hierarchy
    - Whether it's a management group, which is used to organize multiple subscriptions
    - Whether you've assigned a policy to a subscription, or even to a resource group
    - Of course, if you've assigned a policy to a subscription, it flows down to all resource groups in the subscription
    - Now, we're going to click Assign policy up at the top here.
  - We're going to work with this checking for disk encryption at the VM level
    - First thing we have to do is determine the scope where we want this policy assignment to take place.
    - It's set by default at the subscription level, but if we click on the options button
    - The Launch scope selector button on the far right, if we have a management group we could assign the policy to a management group.
  - We haven't selected the policy yet, but that means the policy, whatever it is
    - Would be applied to all subscriptions that are under the management group
    - Or we could tie it to a subscription, or even a specific resource group within the subscription
    - We want this to be applied at the subscription level
    - So the policy assignment will flow down to all resource groups under our Pay-As-You-Go subscription, that's fine.
    - That was the default selection. Now, we could exclude specific resource groups 
  - If we have a resource group that should not have this policy, which we haven't yet selected or applied
    - We could choose a Resource Group to exclude but we are not going to do that
    - Now, we have to specify the policy definitions, so click the selector button to do that
  - From here, we can filter and going to type in the word encrypt
    - We are interested in the one that we looked at previously, Disk encryption should be applied on virtual machines
    - Basically, in this particular example, we are assigning a policy that's really used to check for compliance
    - In this case, at the security configuration level we are going to go ahead and select that
    - There are many other policies we could have chosen, but this is what I'm using in this example
    - We want to make sure that this policy is enforced, and I'm going to click the Review + create button
  - There's really nothing else that we want to do here, so create this assignment by clicking the Create button
    - We can now see that the assignment succeeded.
  - We now have our disk encryption being checked on virtual machine disks being applied to the subscription scope, the Pay-As-You-Go subscription
    - At this point, we can then wait for that to happen. Now, how long does that take to happen? 
    - Can we force it along? No, you cannot. So we can take a minimum of 15 minutes
    - Depending on how many virtual machines you have in your subscription, actually
    - Really depends on how many objects you have deployed in your subscription, it can take longer
    - So the more objects that there are then the longer it takes
    - But at any point in time, you can come back and you could check the Compliance view 
    - To see if it's yet completed doing its search for virtual machines, we can see our assignment is listed and hasn't even started
    - So it hasn't even checked virtual machines to look at their compliance state.


Policy Assignment and the CLI
  - You can use the Azure CLI to manage policies.
    - In the Azure portal, ensure that policies is opened up, where we can go and take a look at policy Definitions.
  - Now this is in the GUI console. Of course, we can view policy definitions as well in the CLI
    - But before we do that, here in the portal we can also view policy Assignments
    - Of which we have one for disk encryption being checked at the Pay-As-You-Go subscription Scope level.
  - Let's open up Cloud Shell and let's explore this just a little bit.
    - The first thing we'll do here in the Cloud Shell is I'm going to type az policy -h for help to see what the next level commands would be.
    - Such as assignment, if we want to create a policy assignment as opposed to working with policy definitions
    - We are going to run cls to clear the screen and az policy assignment -h.
    - From here, we'll then see the next level commands after that, such as creating an assignment.
  - We can learn more about that, we'll just use the up-arrow key here, by changing this to az policy assignment create -h for help once again
    - Then we're seeing some details about what we would do to actually create a policy assignment, along with some examples of how 
    - Now having done that, let's take a look at a few other things related to policies, such as az policy definition list.
    - We want to list policy definitions the way we looked at the policy definitions view in the GUI.
  - There are quite a few of them and each of them has quite a few properties, as we can see here, so the listing can be somewhat long
    - What we can do is query the output of this using the cli --query parameter.
