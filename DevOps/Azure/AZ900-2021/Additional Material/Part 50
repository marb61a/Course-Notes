Azure AD Group License Assignment (Cont)
  - Let's also look at the Members of this group. So we can see we have two users, Jen Hill and Lucas Brenner.
    - Okay, having that knowledge, let's go back to Licenses, where there are none, and let's click the + Assignments button.
  - From here we can determine which ones we're interested in, let's say Enterprise Mobility + Security E5
    - When we check that on, we can select the specific license options that we are interested in.
    - We want all of them so we are going to choose Save.
    - It says the License assignments succeeded, in this case at the group level.
  - So if we go back to our EastAdmins group, and again, we might have to click on something else and come back and look at the licenses.
    - Then we can now see Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 has been assigned. Now let's go look at the members.
    - So if we go back to the Members, we had two of them, Jen Hill and Lucas Brenner. So let's click on user Jen Hill.
    - Let's take a look at her licenses.
    - Now because she's in a group called All Enabled Users that already had that same product assigned, we can see that it's listed here.
    - Not through the group that we just looked at, but through a group she already had it assigned called All Enabled Users.
    - And notice it says, Inherited. Inherited means that the license wasn't assigned directly, in this case, to this user.
  - But rather it's inherited by being a member of a group, in this case, the All Enabled Users group
    - Notice though that up above, for the Azure Active Directory Premium P2 product for this user, be Jen Hill, it says Direct and Inherited.
    - So she was directly assigned this product license.
    - And also she inherited it because she's in the All Enabled Users group.
    - You don't need both of those assignment paths. Either one of them will do just fine for a given product. 

                    
Azure AD Group Ownership
  - You can set owners for Azure AD groups, and as a result, the group owner has the ability to manage that group including things like group membership
    - Which means that the help desk doesn't need to be involved when users need to become a member of a group
    - As an example, because the group owner can handle that.
  - So let's take a look at this in Azure AD we are in our tenant
    - We are going to click on the Groups view over on the left, where we've got a number of groups, one of which is called EastAdmins.
    - We are going to click on that group, and are going to click on Owners over on the left.
  - We'll see any existing owners of the group, but we can add multiple owners.
    - Then we are going to click the Add owners button at the top.
    - We are going to add user Lucas Brenner, an existing Azure AD user, as the owner of this group, in addition to Cody Blackwell being an owner of the group.
    - So Lucas Brenner is listed and we have our notification in the upper right, that says the group owner was successfully added.
  - Here in the web browser, user Lucas Brenner has been signed into account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com.
    - What are the things that's visible here when you sign into this URL is Groups over on the right.
    - So we're going to go ahead and click Groups to open that up.
    - Now that opens up a new web browser window, and notice that under Groups we own there's the option to create a group.
  - But there's also the EastAdmins group because we just finished adding Lucas Brenner in the QUICK24X7 Azure AD tenant as an owner of the EastAdmins group.
    - On the right, we see the groups that this user, Lucas Brenner, is in
    - All Enabled Users, EastAdmins, and also the ability to join a group that's not listed here.
  - So under the Groups that we own, we see the EastAdmins group.
    - Ifwe click on that to open it up, we can see that this user, Lucas Brenner, has the ability to edit the details or delete the group.
    - And the reason for this here is because Lucas Brenner is listed as an Owner.
  - You can also over on the right where we have a list of the members of the group, click the + sign, the add sign, to add members by searching for them.
    - For example, if we search for a user by the name of marcia, well up pops Marcia Lin, we can click Add and then the user is then added to the group.
  - That will be reflected also in the portal, back in the portal
    - Looking at the Members of the EastAdmins group, we'll see that Marcia Lin has just been added by the owner, Lucas Brenner. 


Azure AD Group Self-service
  - The owner of an Azure AD group has the ability to manage all aspects of that group. Now let's verify this here in the portal.
    - Let's go into our Azure AD tenant, which we've already done.
    - And let's go to the Groups view to view existing groups.
  - We are interested in a group called EastAdmins, so click on that group and start by looking at the Members.
    - We've got a single member here in the form of user Jen Hill.
    - If we go to Owners, we'll see that we've got not one but two owners here.
  - User Codey Blackwell, and user Lucas Brenner. We're going to focus on this from the perspective of Lucas Brenner, the group owner
    - We're going to take a look at the member list, which again only consists of Jen Hill.
  - What we're going to do is we're going to go back and look at our Users, in Azure AD, we have a user called Marcia Lin.
    - We want to make sure that Marcia Lin is added as a member of the EastAdmins group, but we want her to make a request to join the group.
  - That's where group self service is going to kick in. So let's go back to our Azure AD tenant. Let's go back into Groups.
    - Then we are going to click in the left-hand navigator under Settings, General.
  - At the top, we're going to have some group self-service options
    - The first of which is whether or not Owners can manage group membership requests in the Access Panel
    - By default in Azure AD, that's set to No, we've already turned it on, so Yes
    - The second option for Self Service Group Management says Restrict access to Groups in the Access Panel, it's set to No, that's also a default
    - Now we want to leave it at that, we don't want to restrict access to groups in the Access Panel web interface
    - We want users to be able to see that, having done that, that's good
    - Now what we're going to do is we're going to log into the Access Panel as user Marcia Lin
    - She's going to request to join the EastAdmins group.
    - In a browser, we are just going to connect to this URL and then sign in as user Marcia Lin.
  - Now that we are signed in as that user, if we were to click Groups here
    - Because we didn't restrict group access in the Access Panel, it's why that showed up.
  - We can see groups that this user, Marcia Lin, is in. All Enabled Users, but she also has the option here to join a group.
    - So we are going to choose EastAdmins.
    - The problem here is that when we go to the EastAdmins group here, it says, This group is not available to join.
  - What's up with this? Well, in order to find out what's up
    - We need to log in as one of the group owners and edit the group properties here in the Access Panel.
    - We've signed in as the owner of the group EastAdmins, Lucas Brenner.
  - What we are going to do is click the Groups panel over on the right.
    - We're going to see that this is a group that is owned by Lucas Berner, it shows up under Groups we own.
    - We are going to click to open up that group.
    - What we want to do is edit the details so we'll click Edit details.
  - Notice that the Group policy here says, Only the owner of this group can add members
    - Well, no wonder users can't request to join the group
    - We are going to open this up, and either select, This group is open to join for all users, or This group requires owner approval.
  - It really depends on the nature of the group and how it's going to be used
    - Let's say we choose, This group requires owner approval, and choose Update, and it's done.
  - Now we're going to log out, log back in as Marcia Lin and she's going to request group membership
    - She's going to try once again for the EastAdmins group. Okay, Marcia Lin is now logged in again, let's go to Groups.
    - And she wants to join a group.
  - So she's going to click Join group. It's going to be EastAdmins.
    - This time, we have the option for her to join the group.
    - So let's click the Join group button.
    - May I please join. And I'll click the Request button.
    - A request is then going to be made available for group owners, and they have to approve it.
    - So we are going to click OK.
  - As you might guess, we're going to log out from Marcia Lin and log in as Lucas Brenner. And check out that request.
    - Okay, we are in as Lucas Brenner. Well, first thing I noticed is I've got a notification here.
