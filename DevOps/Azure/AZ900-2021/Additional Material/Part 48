                    Additional Material Course Notes Part 48


Azure AD Deleted Groups (Cont)
  - We've got our new Off365Group, and of course under the Group Type column, notice it says Office
    - We are going to go ahead and select that group and Delete it. So Delete the selected groups? OK.
    - At the same time, we are going to choose a Security group, it's not Office 365.
  - It's called Team1, and we are going to Delete it as well, then choose OK
    - Now when we go to the Deleted groups view, notice the only thing we see is the Off365Group.
  - Because Security groups don't get this option where you have up to 30 days where you can restore the group
    - We can select my Off365Group, we can elect to delete it permanently
    - Or we can choose to restore it and its members, if there are any members
    - We are going to go ahead and choose Restore group Yes, want to go back to All groups.
  - The Off365Group now shows up again, any group members that were a member of that group before we deleted it will still be a member
    - Just bear in mind that when you delete groups, you are never deleting the members of that group, just the group itself.


Azure AD Windows 10 Device Join
  - You can join Windows 10 devices to an Azure AD tenant. And the benefit of doing this is for centralized management
    - It allows the station to be joined to the domain, and it allows users to use that station 
    - And sign in with their Azure AD credentials and gain access to cloud based resources
    - To get started here in the portal, let's go to our Azure AD tenant.
    - Go to the Devices view. Currently there are no devices in this tenant.
  - It says no device found, but that will change shortly. Let's go back to our tenant and let's go into our list of users.
    - Because you need to join a Windows 10 device to the domain, given a specific set of user credentials, and we're going to use Mr. Lucas Brenner.
  - We are going to go ahead and copy this person's email address
    - Of course we have the password as well and we're going to use these credentials to join a Windows 10 device to the tenant
    - Here on my Windows 10 computer, we've gone into Windows settings from the start menu and we are going to search for work
    - Then we are going to choose access work or school.
  - This is where we want to connect to Azure AD Connect to our account
    - We are going to click Connect. And at this point, it's going to ask for credentials
    - We are going to put in the email address for Lucas Brenner.
  - We are going to click Next. Of course, the next thing is it's going to want to know is what's the password for that account? 
    - Go ahead and put that in and click Sign in
    - We can see it's registering the device with Azure AD and after a moment, it'll say you're all set! 
    - You've added your account, you now have access to your organization's apps and services
  - If we click the Done button after a moment when the screen refreshes
    - We can see here that this computer is connected to an Azure account so we can see the email address listed here.
  - Let's go back and check it out in the portal. So back here in the portal, let's go to our Azure AD tenant and let's go to the Devices view.
    - And sure enough, we can see the Windows computer name here.
    - We can see it's Enabled, the OS is Windows. We can see the version. 
  - It's Azure AD registered, and that was done with Lucas Brenner's credentials. So Lucas Brenner, the user, then, is listed as the Owner
    - There's no Mobile Device Management, or MDM. And we can see when it was Registered and when it last had Activity
    - It's date and time stamped. Users can then sign in using their Azure AD credentials to the Windows 10 device
    - As administrators in Azure, we can even enable conditional access policies 
    - That take a look at the device IP address or the device type to make a decision as to which cloud resources it should have access to.


Azure AD Device Settings
  - There are many benefits to joining Windows 10 devices to an Azure AD tenant
    - One of which is the fact that it allows the user to sign into that Windows 10 station using their Azure AD credentials
    - Additionally, it then gives them access to Azure based resources. Let's take a look at some Azure AD device settings.
    - Here in the portal, we are going to navigate to my Azure AD tenant. Why don't we start by going to the Devices view?
    - We will see any existing devices joined to the tenant.
  - We've got one Windows 10 laptop, we can click on it to pull up details here, so we can see the Device ID, the Object ID.
    - We can also see it's running Windows 10. We can see the owner is someone by the name of Lucas Brenner
    - This is the account that was used to join the device to the domain
    - And we can see when it was registered with the domain and when it last had activity
    - Now if the device is configured to store BitLocker, disk encryption keys in a directory service, then we would have BitLocker key information listed
  - We are going to go back to the Devices portion of Azure AD, and are going to click on Device settings on the left to open up that blade.
    - Now there are a number of device settings here that are important when it comes to determining who is allowed to join devices to the domain.
    - The default here for Users may join devices to Azure AD is set to All.
  - We could set that to None. We could choose Selected, and then follow through by clicking Selected
    - Clicking the Add button, and basically going through and selecting Azure AD groups or users that should have the ability to join devices to Azure AD.
    - Again, the default is that anybody can do that. So let's close out of that.
  - We are going to put that back on the default of All, then we can determine any Azure AD accounts 
    - That should also be added as local administrators on Azure AD joined devices so that they have full admin access to those joined devices.
  - Currently it's None, we could choose Selected, we could go through and select Azure AD users or groups, so we can add them.
    - And these would be accounts that would have access, specifically, we're selecting users here.
    - Not groups, but specific users that should have additional, local admin access on those joint devices, close out of that.
    - We also have the option down below to require Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA to join devices to the domain.
  - We can specify the maximum number of devices that each user can join
    - So we have a number of settings here that are available that control how device join works in Azure AD.


Azure AD Device Disable
  - You have the option of disabling Azure AD joined devices
    - You would disable a device, for example, if the device perhaps is a laptop and it's been lost or stolen
    - Or if you simply don't want to allow that device to be used to access cloud-based resources in Azure.
  - To make this happen, to disable a device, we start by going to our Azure AD Tenant which we are going to do and we go to the Devices view.
    - Now in the Devices view, of course, we will see all of the domain join devices.
  - The one that we want to disable is shown right here
    - We are going to click on the name of it to open up its properties were up at the top, we have the option of disabling it.
  - Notice you can also Delete it, what disabling might be done temporarily?
    - For example, until we determine whether the laptop will be recovered or not, where Delete is more permanent
    - We going to go ahead and choose Disable, and then choose Yes.
  - It tells us that it's successfully disabled that Azure AD device, and of course, we can go back and enable it.
    - For example, if the device was temporarily lost and has now been found, go back to our devices view here in our Azure AD tenant.
    - We can see that it's not Enabled any longer.
  - Now this can take a bit of time, for example, it might take 60 minutes before this is actually known by the device
    - You might wonder, why are users still able to use that disable device to sign in?, because it's not immediate
    - The other thing to bear in mind is that, if a user has signed into that device previously
    - Prior to you disabling it, they will still be able to sign in locally 
    - Even if there's no network connectivity because there's a cached copy of those credentials
    - Of course, the users will not at some point, be able to access cloud-based resources, some point meaning perhaps even up to 60 minutes
    - They might get a message on their device says, your organization has disabled the device.
  - Also, if the user is signed into their apps control panel, so here it's account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com
    - If signed in as Lucas Brenner, that's the owner of the device.
    - If Lucas Brenner goes into his Profile, he'll see that the device is shown here.
    - Normally, before the device is disabled, he'll see here that he can disable it. So back here in the portal, let's go in to that device again.
  - And what we're going to do is Enable it, then it says, it successfully enabled the device.
    - Let's go back into the my apps access penal for Lucas Brenner.
    - If we go back into the Profile for Lucas Brenner, notice the devices here and notice, we have a link now to disable it.
  - Now that's there because, of course, we just re-enabled it  
    - So there are few ways that this might be enabled to disabled
    - The user might actually take this upon themselves if they're traveling for work and realize
    - For example, that their laptop was stolen at the airport, so they can disable it themselves
    - They know about this feature without involving the help desk at this point.
