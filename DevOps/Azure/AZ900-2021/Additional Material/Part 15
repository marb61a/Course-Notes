Azure Backup Service Overview
  - Data backup provides availability in the event that production data becomes corrupted or deleted in some way, we can restore it from backup
    - And there are a few considerations when using "Microsoft Azure Backup" services
    - We can back up "On-premises" data in the form of "Files and folders"
    - Even "Hyper-V and VMware VMs" we're hosting on prem, "SQL server, Exchange server, SharePoint server installations
  - We can even back up system state, which would include things like operating system boot files, registry settings on a Windows Machine
    - If it's a Windows domain controller server, even backing up the database for active directory is part of system state
    - Then we can also perform a "Bare Metal recovery". When you set up a "Bare Metal recovery"
    - What you're really doing is telling Azure Backup you want to backup the entire operating system, so all the OS files and the data on those volumes
    - So really, it's everything except for user data
  - To work with Azure Backup, you need to install the "Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent"
    - Or the "MARS" agent, on your server that contains the services you want backed up
    - That will allow the communication to the Azure cloud, specifically to the recovery services vault for backup purposes
    - Azure backup lets you backup Microsoft Azure virtual machines, "Azure SQL Database" and "Azure File Share"
  - The process for setting up on-premises backup, let's say if we have an on-prem Windows Server we want to back up to the Azure Cloud
    - Would be to first make sure that we have a "Recovery Services Vault" created in Azure
    - Next, we would "Download and install the MARS agent" on the server, whose services we want backed up
    - Then we would "Register MARS agent with the recovery services vault"
    - After that you can enable the backup for the services on that server where the MARS agent is now installed


Recovery Services Vault
  - That's going to let us create a recovery services vault so choose "Create"
    - We need to tie this to a "Resource group" so do that and for the example call this "Vault1"
    - It's going to check that that name is valid and it is, and it's going to be in the, let's place that vault in our configuration
  - We can choose a region but leave it in our main region, we will put it there
    - Then we are going to click "Next" for tagging, we are not going to tag this fault
    - After that, we're just going to click "Review + Create" and after which we will click "Create"
    - We are deploying a recovery services vault
  - Now the vault has been deployed, click "Go to resource" so we can take a look at it
    - You can think of a recovery services vault in Azure as being essentially the launching pad for your business continuity solutions
    - For example, let's scroll down here and we are going to click, under "Getting started", "Backup"
  - This is where we can determine if we want to backup items sourced in "Azure" such as "virtual machines", "SQL Server", "Azure FileShare"
    - Or we might select "On-premises" and choose "Files and folders", or on-premises "Hyper-V" 
    - Or "VMware Virtual Machines", on-premises "SQL Server", "SharePoint", "Exchange", and so on
  - We can also go to our "Site Recovery" option on the left and start to prepare our infrastructure.
    - This is where we might choose, okay, we've got our virtual machines that might exist "On-premises"
    - We want to make them available for high availability in "Azure"
    - It asks, "Are you performing a migration?", we could do that, but choose "No"
    - We can tell it that my source on-premises would be "Hyper-V" or "VMware virtual machines" or they're not virtualized.
  - You can actually enable failover for an on-premises physical server 
    - To an Azure VM Failback isn't supported in that context to the on-prem physical server but failover to the VM in the cloud is
    - Also, here, we have a number of other options available within the recovery services vaults, such as configuring "Backup policies"
  - Not only are we talking about high availability, such as for virtual machines, but also the ability to back data up into the Azure Cloud
    - Which really enables data high availability, he Recovery Services vault then allows for all of this disaster recovery planning.


Azure Backup Policies
  - We are going to use the portal to create a backup policy within a Recovery Services vault
    - We've already got a vault created here, it's a recovery services vault, it's called "Vault1"
    - Click to open it up, within its navigation panel on the left scroll down until "Manage" section where we can see "Backup policies"
    - We are then going to pull up that blade.
  - We see on the right that we have two default backup policies here automatically
    - One is called" HourlyLogBackup" for "SQL Server in Azure VMs"
    - And the other is called "DefaultPolicy", it's for "Azure Virtual Machines"
    - However, we want my own custom policy for "Azure Virtual Machines", so click the "Add" button
  - You might even have a policy for "Azure Virtual Machines" that applies to only some, where you want to use the default VM policy for others
    - Either way, in this case, we can select" Azure Virtual Machine", "Azure File Share", "SQL Server in Azure VM," or "SAP HANA in Azure VM"
    - But we're talking about "Azure Virtual Machine" backup policies here, so select that
  - First thing we have to do is give this a name so we are going to call this "ProdVMs", as in Production Virtual Machines
    - And we can set the backup schedule, whether it be daily, or weekly
    - We are going to leave it at daily and we can set the time of the day we want that to fire off
    - Maybe after hours, at 7:30 PM, and we can select the specific time zone if we so choose, or we can even use "UTC"
    - The next thing is, how many days do we want to use retention of instant recovery snapshots?
    - The default here is two days which is fine so we are going to leave that
  - As we go further down, we have the retention range of the backups, which is going to be 180 days, that can be changed
     - We want the retention of a weekly backup point and we can also specify details related to the "monthly" and "yearly" backup point retention period
     - We can specify the details when exactly that is going to be taken
     - And for how many months or years in the case of the yearly backup point that we want that retained
  - If you're using Azure services that set up VMs for you in the background
    - In other words managed VMs, you can also specify resource group information for those, specifically to store their recovery points
    - We are going to go ahead and click "Create" to create this policy, once it's done, go back to our "Vault1" Backup policies
  - We can now see we've got a new policy called "ProdVMs" and it's of type "Azure Virtual Machines"
    - We can click on it to open it up at any point in time to see the details that were configured
    - At any time, we could go back and modify and change whichever options are required
    - This backup policy, then, can be selected when we start enabling backup for Azure VMs


Azure VM Backup and the Portal
  - One way to enable backup for an Azure VM is to use the portal
    - To get started here be in the "All resources" view and filter the list for our vault
    - We've got a recovery services vault called "Vault1", and it's in the main region
    - We filter this again looking for a virtual machine called "AppServer1", it's also in the main region
    - We want to enable protection of "AppServer1" to our vault, "Vault1"
  - We want to set up backup, so click on our server, our virtual machine
    - What we are going to do in the navigation bar on the left is scroll down under "Operations" and choose "Backup"
    - Now when we look at it from this perspective, we have the option of configuring backup from here
    - You can also do it from the vault, but I'm going to continue from this perspective, from the VM's perspective
  - We can either create a new recovery services vault but there's no need, we already have one in this region called "Vault1"
    - Within the vault, we can select the appropriate backup policy
    - We've got a custom backup policy that we created previously called "ProdVMs"
    - The backup policy determines things like retention periods for backup and restore points
  - We are going to go ahead and set "ProdVMs" as the backup policy in this case
    - We can see that when we do that, it starts showing me down below some of the details within that policy
    - So the "Retention range" for "daily backup points", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"
    - We are okay with that, so go ahead and click "Enable backup"
  - After a moment, we can see on our notification area that it succeeded, the backup configuration
    - Take a look at this time from the perspective of the, well, let's start with the server
    - But then we're going to go into the "Vault1", and see what it looks like on that end of things
    - So back here in our virtual machine, let's go back to where we enabled backup
