                    Additional Material Course Notes Part 41


Azure AD Users and the Portal (Cont)
  - We are going to leave that as it is, and then scroll down and just fill in a couple of other details
    - So Codey Blackwell, that's the full name, and we will just fill in the first name, the last name.
  - Down below because we're creating a new account, it asks whether we want to auto-generate the password, or do we want to specify it?
    - We are going to let it Auto-generate it and choose Show Password and copy it, so we can communicate that to the user.
  - At this time, we can also determine if the user is going to be a member of a group, and which roles they have, which gives them certain permissions
    - However, we are not going to change any of that, we certainly don't want a Block sign in for this user
    - We not going to fill in any other details, go ahead and click Create to create example user Codey Blackwell
    - Before you know it, the user shows up here in the list of Azure AD users, we will then test logging in as Codey Blackwell.
    - One way to do that is to connect to account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/, which we will do now.
  - We are going to specify the full email address of the new user, so cblackwell@ and then of course my Azure AD tenant DNS domain name
    - The default is that it will always end with.onmicrosoft.com unless you create custom DNS domain names, but that's the default setting
    - We can go ahead and click Next, it's going to ask us for the password
    - We are going to go ahead and put in the auto-generated password that we previously copied and choose Sign in.
  - Of course it wants me to change the passwords, so we'll put in the existing auto-generated password, we will specify a new password and confirm it
    - Then we'll click Sign in, when it asks us to stay signed into my web browser, just choose No.
    - We can now see that we are successfully signed in as user Codey Blackwell as part of the QUICK24X7 Azure AD tenant.


Azure AD Users and the CLI
  - Not only can you use the Azure portal to create and manage Azure AD user accounts, but you can also do this using the Azure CLI.
  - The CLI can also be spawned here in the Azure portal as opposed to running it on-premises, and that's how we run it
    - In the portal, we are going to click the Cloud Shell icon at the top in the bar
    - Then we are going to make sure we are in a PowerShell session which allows us to run PowerShell cmdlets as well as Azure CLI commands.
  - The first thing we are going to want to do here is, create an account in Azure AD
    - To do that, we are going to run az ad user, there is a space between each of those words
    - If we are not sure where to progress from here we can use the -h to get help with the next level commands.
  - It looks like create as opposed to add or new
    - We could also use the up arrow key, to bring up the previous command and we know that creates the next level part of the syntax, okay
    - But what after that, we don't know what to put in
    - We could use -h and we can learn more about the various parameters that we could specify to create the user.
  - We can see arguments like display-name, password, user-principal-name, force-password-change-next-login, and so on
    - This gives us enough to get started, az ad user create --display-name and in this case
    - For example say we are going to create a user whose name will be "Jen Hill" -- user-principal-name
    - It's going to be jhill@ and then we have to put in the DNS domain suffix for my tenant
    - If we are not sure what that is, we can, for example, let's minimize this, click to open up our left-hand navigator menu.
    - Go to Azure Active Directory, there's much ways to view this, of course, in the Overview, we'll see the entire name.
  - In this case, it's quick24x7test.onmicrosoft.com
    - So, .onmicrosoft.com is the default DNS suffix unless you've created a custom DNS domain name for your tenant, which we haven't
    - Go back into the CLI here and go ahead and paste that right in there
    - We're just going to right click and choose Paste. Okay, that part is in there
    - Text thing that we want to do is, specify the passwords
    - We can do that with --password and tell that within double quotes, a specific password that we want to use
    - Once we have done that, we can press Enter to create the user account.
  - If we don't have a password that complies with password complexity requirements
    - As we can see has not been done here, then we are going to have to come up with something different
    - We are going to use the up arrow key and specify a different password for this account
    - Once we filled in that password, we can go ahead and try to see if it will accept our newly created password.
  - This time, we didn't get the red error message, so it looks good
    - And as a matter of fact, let's just minimize Cloud Shell for a second, but just check our work here in the GUI.
    - In our Quick24x7 Azure AD tenant, go to the Users view, we'll see the newly created Jen Hill.
  - Let's go back into the CLI and poke around a little bit and clear the screen
    - If we were to run az ad user list, it'll list ou Azure AD users, but notice what we get returned all of the properties.
  - At this level, we'd have to scroll through to find exactly what we wanted to see. 
    - We don't want to have to do that, there's got to be a better way
    - Let us clear the screen with the clear command, we could do stuff like, say az ad user list
    - If you're a UNIX or a Linux shell scripting person or just a command line person
    - You could pipe it to the grep line filtering command and tell it what you want to see
    - For example, all that we want to see is the mailNickname property
    - So only show us those lines and sure enough, it looks like it's working.
  - However, you could also do some CLI-specific stuff
    - What we mean by that is you could run, for example, az ad user list and you could use --query
    - This will work with anything in the CLI to query something out
    - The problem is, it's not a problem, but if we were to just assume we could put in the property name, mailNickname, then we would get nothing.
  - However, you may say well maybe it's case sensitive, it's not going to make a difference. So if I just put it all lowercase, still nothing.
    - The reason is because if you think about the command output, it's returning more than one item
    - It's returning an array or a collection of users and you need to reference that before the property names
    - So up arrow key to bring up previous command and put an open and close square bracket to reference the fact that we're dealing with an array
    - Dot, to separate the array item, the user, from the property, in this case mailnickname and press Enter.
  - Again, if we change the n in nickname to a capital N because it is case sensitive, we can now see that it's returning the mailNickname
    - here are a few things then, that we can do using the Azure CLI to work with user accounts in Azure AD.


Azure AD Users and PowerShell
  - You can use PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage Azure AD user accounts.
    - Of course, you could also use the portal, as we see here to create new users
    - Or to click on existing users to make changes to any properties and so on
    - Here we are going to click on Cloud Shell at the top of the bar here in my Azure Portal screen.
  - We are going to make sure we are in PowerShell, where we can run both PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI commands.
    - We could download PowerShell locally on my computer, but we are going to choose to use the Cloud Shell here instead
    - The first thing we need to figure out is what might the name of the cmdlet be if we want to add a new Azure Active Directory user?
    - We can figure that out using get-command. For example, get-command, maybe we'll use an asterisk
    - Maybe we'll put in azaduser, that's a guess but we are assuming that would be part of the name. Otherwise we could try different variations.
    - Luckily this looks reasonable. we've got a New-AzADUser cmdlet as opposed to add or anything like that or create.
  - That's good news, because now we can get help about that cmdlet now that we know what it's called
    - We might run get-help and we might ask for help for the new-azaduser cmdlet, maybe even ask for details, -details
    - Or detail in singular rather not details
    - Here we can see that it's returned back the information that we wanted for this, so it gives me a brief synopsis, creates a new active directory user.
  - That's true specifically in Azure and we get a sense of how the syntax would be used
    - What's important here because there could be a lot of parameters is that it explains each and every one of them
    - Even more handy, as we go way down, we have some examples of how we might actually create, a new Azure Active Directory user
    - We can see here, they are converting a regular string for a password to a secure string using the ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet
    - Before they actually build the new user and pass the password with the -Password priority.
    - You can see the variable they're using here is $SecureStringPassword.
    - Variables in PowerShell, are always prefixed with a dollar sign, we have some great help here.
  - Clear the screen, and make it happen, the first thing we want to do, is make a password very long
    - So we are going to call it $pw for password
    - We are going to put in =, and run the convertto-securestring cmdlet
    - We are going to use the -string parameter and specify the password that we want to use for this
    - Let's say it's something like this, we are specifying the password here within double quotation marks
    - It's plain text, so -asplaintext and we are going to -force this, and then press Enter.
