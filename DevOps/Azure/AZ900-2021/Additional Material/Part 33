Azure Subscriptions and PowerShell
  - When you're working in PowerShell, you might be working with an Azure AD tenant that is associated with multiple subscriptions
    - And, so you can control the subscription that is going to be used as you issue PowerShell cmdlets
    - Such as the deployment of resources like virtual machines
    - To get started in the portal, launch the Cloud Shell and make sure that is where you are
  - We go to start by running get-command, we will put in asterisk subscription
    - Basically, we are trying to discover which cmdlets are available that relate to subscriptions.
  - There are bunch of them as you can see. For example, Get-AzSubscription
    - If we were to do that, get-azsubscription, when we press Enter, we get some returned information.
  - We can see that we have a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, which is currently active and being used
    - So, if we start deploying virtual machines and storage accounts and so on, it's going to be tied to this currently active subscription
    - We can see the subscription ID. We can also see the Azure Active Directory tenant with which the subscription is associated.
  - When you have multiple subscriptions available for your Azure AD tenant, you may want to be able to switch between them
    - You can do that using select-azurermsubscription
    - For example, in quotes here we could do it by name, pay-as-you-go, close the quotes.
  - What this means is, we are setting that as the current context or active subscription
    - Any commands that follow will be tied to it. Such as deploying virtual machines, storage accounts and so on
    - We can verify that, that's the current context by running get-azurermcontext.
  - We can see it returns that we are using our Pay-As-You-Go subscription
    - Of course, we can see the subscription identifier being listed there as well along with our Azure AD tenant ID
    - Now that we've done that, any PowerShell cmdlets that we run from this point forward in this session will be applied to that subscription.


Management Group Overview
  - Azure management groups are really all about centralized governance
    - Now we can apply this to multiple subscriptions, it allows us to organize subscriptions within a management group
    - Think if it as a hierarchy, because at the top, you have your tenant root group
    - Under which you can then create multiple management groups and organize your subscriptions accordingly within them
    - Now you would organize them for policy and compliance reasons.
  - For example, you might have a policy that requires SQL database encryption
    - You want to check all SQL database instances in multiple subscriptions
    - You might organize those subscriptions into a management group and then assign that policy to the management group
    - You can have up to six levels deep of subordinate management groups
    - If you so need that change, down here, we see we have the management group hierarchy.
  - At the top you have your tenant Root Management Group, by default
    - Underneath it on the left we have Management Group 1 where we could organize subscriptions
    - In the example we can see Subscription 1 and Subscription 2
    - Then on the right we have another management group, Management Group 2, under which we have a different subscription, Subscription 3
    - We can apply or assign policies to Management Group 1.
  - Whatever that policy says should happen, such as checking for SQL database encryption, will flow down and be inherited
    - And be applied to all SQL database deployments in Subscription 1, and Subscription 2 in all resource groups
    - The same thing would be true, if we applied a policy to Management Group 2, it would only apply to, in this case, Subscription 3
    - Now, we've really only got one level in our hierarchy here of management groups that we've created. Bear in mind, you could have up to six
    - So, the way that this works is we would add subscriptions as per usualto our Azure account and associate them with Azure AD tenants.
  - We can then create one or more management groups, then we can move subscriptions under the appropriate management groups
    - And then we can apply our governance options, in other words, assign policies to management groups
    - Which in turn means that the subscriptions in the management groups will inherit that policy assignment.


Configuring a Management Group
  - If your organization's use of Azure includes the use of multiple Azure subscriptions 
    - It can be a little bit cumbersome to apply permissions at the policy level to resources in multiple subscriptions.
  - For example, if you want to limit something such as virtual machine types that can be deployed in certain regions
    - Instead of doing that per subscription, if you have the same requirements for the subscriptions
    - You might organize those subscriptions first into a management group and apply that policy to the management group
    - It'll flow down and be inherited by all of the subscriptions, it works well in that sense
    - Go ahead and see how that works in the portal so in the portal search for management and choose Management groups.
  - Now you always will have your default Tenant Root Group under which subscriptions exist, we can see our Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
    - But you can organize a hierarchy, kind of like how you would organize a hierarchy of organizational units or a use in on-premises Active Directory
    - To organize resources. In this case, we would be creating management groups to organize our subscriptions
    - Even though, we only have a single subscription, we are still going to go through create a management group 
    - And then move that subscription into that management group part of the hierarchy
    - The first thing we are going to do is to click Add management group in the upper left
    - We need an ID for it, call it mgmt1111 and we are going to call this MgmtGroup1, then click Save.
  - Now, if you've got multiple subscriptions, let's say tied to a particular business unit
    - You might name your management group in relation to that business unit name. 
  - Or if it's for particular project, maybe name the management group the name of the project or something along those lines
    - After a moment, we'll see that our management group down below is listed.
  - If we I click on it and open it up, there's nothing in it because we haven't moved any subscriptions there yet
    - We are going to go back to my Tenant Root Group where we see our subscription
  - Pay-As-You-Go, over on the far right, click the more context menu, so the three dots and choose Move
    - It's as simple as choosing the target management group that you want to move the subscription under.
    - There's only one there MgmtGroup1, that we've just created a moment to go.
    - We are going to select that and choose Save.
  - After a moment the subscription disappears here from the Tenant Root Group and if we drilled on into MgmtGroup1
    - Well we are going to see that our subscription is now listed there.
  - The reason we would do this is, so that we can essentially apply centralized governance across multiple subscriptions in Azure
    - Let's see how that would work, search for policy up here in the search bar and choose Policy.
    - What we are going to do is take a look at assigning a policy to a management group
    - We are going to click Assignments over on the left, any assignments that we already have will be shown.
    - We are going to click the Assign policy button, now the first thing we'd have to deal with is the Scope.
  - Where do you want this policy assigned?, go down and choose a policy definition, so we at least have something to think about here
    - We'll search for encrypt as we want to make sure a disk encryption is applied on virtual machines. 
  - If your organization has six policies, well, then you potentially would have to configure this six times for each policy scope
    - The scope would be the subscription level. But here we can go one level above that, because subscriptions can be organized into management groups
    - We are going to select that policy.
  - Up above, notice it automatically assumes that we want to apply this policy definition and scour VMS 
    - Looking for disk encryption within only the Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
  - But we are going to click the scope selector button over on the right
    - We could choose a different subscription, if we had others or even on a Resource group within the subscription where we want this policy applied
    - But that is not what we are talking about here
    - We're talking about management groups which we see at the top
    - Here's MgmtGroup1, we can select it, and then choose Select
    - We are now applying this policy definition to scour all subscriptions under MgmtGroup1, looking for machines where disk encryption has not been applied
    - They will then show up in compliance reports.
