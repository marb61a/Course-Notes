Azure Subscription Overview
  - There is a relationship between Azure AD tenants and Azure subscriptions. 
    - We can register devices in Azure AD, so users can sign in on those devices with their Azure AD credentials
    - That's essentially what it is. It's an identity provider and we can associate a subscription with our Azure AD tenant
  - A subscription is really a way that we get features that allow us, for example, to deploy resources in Azure
    - It's also used for billing purposes, you can add multiple subscriptions to your Azure AD tenant
    - However, the opposite is not true, you can't have a given subscription used by multiple AD tenants
  - There are some limits to what you can do within an Azure subscription, such as how many resources can be deployed and so on
    - As an example, our first item here is the number of subscriptions per Azure AD tenant
    - This is one of those items where there is no limit
    - But there is a number of resource tags that can be specified to an Azure resource, and it maxes out at a value of 50
    - The maximum number of group owners maxes out at 100
    - The maximum number of storage accounts per region maxes out at 250
    - This is only to list a tiny portion of some of these limits
    - There are many other ones that are published online, clearly, in the Microsoft Azure documentation.
  - We have the option with our subscription to also increase any of these limits should they be a little bit too constraining
    - You can do this once you sign into the Azure portal by creating a customer support request
    - Limits for some things, such as the number of vCPUs, virtual CPUs available for a given virtual machine instance
    - Those limits are quoted per Azure region
    - Bear in mind that if you're using an Azure free trial subscription, t you won't have the option of creating a customer support request
    - At least not in it succeeding in increasing any of those limits.
  - The other thing to think about is that when it comes Azure subscriptions
    - Don't forget about how it is related to both the Azure AD tenant and also your Azure account in the first place
    - You can have your Azure account in which you build your Azure AD tenants, and of course, you can have multiple subscriptions
    - Billing is done separately for each of your subscriptions, if you do have a free try, you can actually convert it to a paid subscription.
  - Now there are a number of different types of Azure subscriptions, such as pay-as-you-go
    - Where all of your resource usage is tracked and you pay based on what you use
    - But then depending on the type of support you need, will determine if you select some of the other types of subscriptions
    - Such as Professional Direct support or Developer support
    - Developer support would allow you to get support but only during business hours, not 24/7
    - Then we also have Standard support, if you do need full support, 24/7, then you would look at choosing the appropriate type of Azure subscription
    - This would be the Professional Direct option


Azure Subscriptions and the Portal 
  - You can view your Azure subscriptions in the Azure portal
    - One way to do this is by searching for subscriptions in the search bar at the top center 
  - Now bear in mind that when you search up subscriptions you will see any subscriptions associated with your current Azure AD tenant
    - Which is shown here as Quick24x7, we can see that we have a Pay-As-You-Go active subscription and can even see the Current cost.
  - In the upper right, click on the sign in account information area and click Switch directory
    - If we choose some other Azure AD tenant, let's say EarthFarm in this example.
    - Then when we go to take a look at subscriptions, we can expect to see something different potentially.
  - Because we've visited subscriptions recently, we can just click it from Azure services
    - Of course, we could once again search for it in the top center
    - Either way, we want to look at the subscriptions for this different Azure AD tenant
    - Notice it says, "You don't have any subscriptions"
    - At this point, we have the option of clicking Add where we'll be presented with a list of subscription options.
    - At this point, we are just going to authenticate so we can get to that screen, now we get the option to SELECT AN OFFER.
  - If we want to add a Pay-As-You-Go subscription or Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test, Developer support, Professional Direct support
    - And Standard support where we can see some of the details about these
    - We have some options here, if we were to choose one of these, it would then continue on to the point 
    - Where we would have to make sure that we add a payment method, and so on
    - We are going to close out of that and switch back to the first initial directory that in this case would be the Quick24x7 Azure AD tenant 
    - Where we know, that we have an active subscription.
  - Once again, we are going to go look in the subscriptions associated with that Azure AD tenant and click directly on that existing subscription.
    - We are going to click directly on that existing subscription. 
  - Because when you do that, it opens up a plethora of options in the navigation bar on the left
    - For example, we can go to Cost analysis to analyze costs, to see exactly for example, where the lion's share of our charges are coming from.
    - We could click on Budgets, so we can configure alert notifications when our costs reach a certain point.
  - We can even go through and see our Invoices over on the left under the Billing section
    - But at the same time, we also have some other things that we can do, when we go back to the Overview part of this.
  - We have some buttons across the top, we can cancel the subscription. 
    - We can Rename it, so, if we want to rename it from Pay-As-You-Go to something different, we can do that
    - We can Change directory, which means we can associate this subscription with a different Azure AD tenant
    - We've got a number of options, we can even click on Manage to open up a new browser window where we can further manage my Azure subscription
    - So we have a summary for our Pay-As-You-Go subscription, where we're looking currently at the OVERVIEW.
  - We can see a lot of options available on the right to Manage payment methods or to Download usage details for the subscription 
    - Or even to change the subscription address information, or switch to a different type of subscription offer
    - Again, we have some other options here such as canceling the subscription and so on.


Azure Subscriptions and the CLI
  - You can use the Azure CLI to learn about Azure subscriptions and also to determine which subscription is active
    - To get started here in the Azure portal, we are going to launch the Cloud Shell.
    - In the Cloud Shell, we are going to start by running az account list.
    - Then when we press Enter, it will return some details.
  - We can see the name of the cloud, AzureCloud, as opposed to Azure Cloud for Government or anything like that
    - We can also see the id, it doesn't say subscription ID, but this is the id of our current Azure subscription
    - We can also see our Azure AD tenant ID. Let's examine the subscription ID for a second by jumping into the portal to take a look at that
    - Notice here it starts with 048b and ends with 2109, so just minimize the shell here
    - Go in to Subscriptions, let's see what we've got attached to our current AZ tenant.
  - Now it should be a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. And notice the Subscription ID indeed starts with 048b and ends with 2109
    - We can learn a bit of that information from the az account list command in the CLI.
  - Clear the screen and also run az account set --subscription
    - Here, we are going to put in the name of it which is Pay-As-You-Go, each word separated by a dash
    - Now in this case, it doesn't really matter that we do that.
  - Because if we go back and take a look, we've only got a single subscription here associated with our Azure AD tenant
    - Which is shown here by name in the form of Quick24x7.
  - But when you have multiple subscriptions, this can be an important command
    - Essentially you're setting the context to that subscription
    - Following commands after you do that will run in the context of that set or selected subscription
    - Also bear in mind is that you can also, instead of setting the subscription when you have multiple subscriptions, you can also do it per command
    - What we mean by that as an example, is let's say we were going to use az vm create to create new VM
    - Normally you would specify things like --resource-group and then Rg1, let's say.
  - Then maybe the name, let's call it Linux1, and then maybe the --image would be based on something Ubuntu
    - But the key here is that we can also use the --subscription command line parameter
    - And so, for this individual single command, you can say, well, we want this tied to the Pay-As-You-Go, just type that in, subscription
    - You can do that if you know you have to work with a number of resources and different subscriptions
    - You might choose to just do it at the command-line instead of keeping on setting it as up above
    - It really depends on what you want to do and how many commands you have to issue
    - But either way, it's important to have this knowledge if you're going to be working with Azure subscriptions through the CLI.
