Log Analytics Workspaces
  - In Azure, a Log Analytics workspace is a resource that you can create and configure in the Azure environment.
    - To get started here in the portal, we are going to look at my All resources view
    - We are going to filter it for objects that are Log Analytics workspaces because we already have some here.
  - We are going to filter for Log Analytics workspaces, click outside of it
    - Here we can see that we've got a couple of them, why would you have more than one Log Analytics workspace
    - Here we've got some for different regions or locations, we can the regions see under the Location heading
  - That's one reason, you might want to have your centralized logging through the Log Analytics workspace per region
    - But you could have multiple Log Analytic workspaces within the same region
    - Maybe because you have different monitoring requirements for different resources within the same region
    - So to get started to add a new Log Analytics workspace, we are going to click the Add button.
    - We are going to search up log analytic, and there it is.
    - Then we are going to select Log Analytics and choose Create.
  - The first thing we have to do is create a name for it or specify a name, for the example call it LogAnalytics-2.
    - We are going to deploy this into an existing resource group.
  - Up above, it's kind of outlined my name in red, in a red outline, because that name is taken
    - We are going to put in some characters to make that a unique name and click outside of it, now the name is unique.
  - Make sure you adhere to your naming standards within your organization when you change some of these names
    - We are going to specify the location where we want this specific Log Analytics workspace, so choose a region
    - We are going leave it with my Pay-as-you-go subscription for the pricing tier and choose OK.
    - Back here in the All resources view, we can see our newly created Log Analytics workspace.
  - We are going to go ahead and click on it to open it up
    - Because one of the first things that you really should contend with is which data sources are connected, to your newly created Log Analytics workspace.
  - Remember, this serves as a centralized performance metric and log data feed
    - Where's that coming from? Well, we can scroll down and go under Workspace Data Sources
    - Here we can click Virtual machines and we're going to see all of the virtual machines that we've got deployed.
    - But we can see here that they are connected to other workspaces.
    - We could go in and click on a specific virtual machine and disconnect it from that workspace, and then connect it to this one.
  - They may not already be connected to other Log Analytics workspaces if you don't have any already defined.
    - That would be one thing that we would do.
    - The other thing is to look at Storage account logs and add storage account logs as well.
    - If you go to Azure Activity log, you'll also be able to link a subscription or connect your subscription here into your Log Analytics workspace.
  - That that type of activity, that would be the management of Azure resources, shows up centrally here in your Log Analytics workspace.
    - Also, if you go in the navigation bar in your workspace to Workspace summary.
    - Here you can add components such as Network Performance Monitor.
  - If we were to click Add, we could search in the Azure Marketplace for Network Performance Monitor.
    - We would add this one, this is from Microsoft.
    - If we wanted to be able to monitor connectivity, let's say between virtual machine endpoints or different subnets in my environment.


Log Analytics Workspace Data Sources
  - A Log Analytics workspace in Azure is created automatically.
    - It is automatically created for the region in which you deploy resources
    - In my example, we have two default workspaces, one for the main region used because we've deployed resources there
    - And also another for our other because we've also deployed resources there.
  - You can build your own manual Log Analytics workspace or work with the ones that are created automatically
    - You can think of it as a centralized way as the name implies to analyze logged information
    - Instead of going to view the log details for each and every Azure resource, instead you can have it collected in one location
    - For example, let's open up one of these default Log Analytics workspaces.
  - What's important is determining the data sources attached to the workspace
    - You can see that when you open up the workspace, if you scroll down in the navigation bar on the left
    - You go to the Workspace Data Sources section, you can see that we can click on Virtual machines to pull up that blade.
  - This will give me a list of all of my VMs and we'll see which ones are attached to this workspace
    - As opposed to other workspaces or just not connected to any workspace at all.
    - We have a number of them here that are connected, you can select and click on an individual
    - In this case, virtual machine, and either disconnect or connect it at any point in time.
    - Connect is unavailable because this VM AppServer2 is already connected to this Log Analytics workspace. 
    - Let's say we went to this other virtual machine which is showing us Not connected to any workspace, then we have the option to click Connect.
    - We've got a number of options available from that perspective.
  - By connecting the virtual machine here, you are allowing yourself to have a centralized place here in the Log Analytics workspace
    - To view all of the log information for all of these attached items.
    - Now those are just Virtual machines. Other data sources include Storage accounts logs.
    - In the same way you can go there and you can click Add if there are none there already added.
    - You can specify storage accounts that you want to add to this centralized Log Analytics workspace.
  - If we were to select a Storage account, we can then specify the Data Type.
    - What type of stuff is stored in that storage account in terms of logging that you want it connected here.
    - Maybe, for example, we know that we've got some IIS logs stored there.
    - We could go ahead and select that and add it here.
    - You can also take a look at Azure activity logs.
  - Now activity logs are essentially kind of like audit logs that give you information about the management of Azure resources themselves
    - As opposed to what's happening within them, such as for a virtual machine, you can link or connect your subscriptions 
  - If we go to my subscription, we could choose Connect to connect that here to have that information here as well.
    - You have a number of different data sources then so that you can centrally collect logged information from your Azure environment.


Log Queries
  - In Azure, it's important to have the skills to properly create log queries and also to be able 
    - To interpret the results for the general overall well being and improved performance, perhaps, of your workloads running in Azure
    - Now you can work with log queries for an individual resource.
  - For example, we can open up an individual virtual machine and in the navigation bar on the left
    - If we scroll all the way down, under Monitoring, we can then go to Logs.
    - From here we can start to conduct log queries.
  - We can start typing in things where we can refer over on the left here to table names
    - There's a table, for example, called Event, and if we expand that we can see the fields within it, we can start referring to them.
    - So for example, if we want to see everything in the Event table, we can simply say Event
    - And we can continue on and tell it that we want to count, or sort, and so on
    - If all I want to do is just take a look at that table, then we could just run that query.
  - If there are results, we would see them here. And you also have the option of using a number of Example queries.
    - If we click that up at the top, so for example, maybe we'll look at Performance and availability
    - We could scroll through and there are numerous items here
    - Such as Virtual Machine free disk space, when we click Run, it puts those query statements in here up above.
    - We can go ahead and run the query, of course, we can select the Time range.
    - It doesn't have to be the Last 24 hours, maybe the Last 7 days, and that type of thing.
  - When you're working with these types of queries, that's what you can do.
    - You can also do this from the perspective if we go Home here of a Log Analytics workspace in Azure.
    - If we open up a specific Log Analytics workspace, then go to Logs, and we can pretty much do the same type of thing.
    - When you first enable logging in your Azure environment, it might take time before it starts to populate this and you can start to use it.
  - That's why up here we've got another browser window open, where to learn how to work with log queries, this is very useful
    - You've got a Demo environment made available by Microsoft.
    - Now when you select it, you can sign in using your normal Azure credentials, and then start to work with log queries.
