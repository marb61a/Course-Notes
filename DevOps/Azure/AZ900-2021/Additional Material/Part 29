Log Queries (Cont)
  - We could see on the left, we're in the Demo environment where we can see a number of interesting categories. 
    - For example, go under Security, then we'll start to see a number of table names
    - These are table names. So for example, there's SecurityAlert, expand that then we see the fields or columns if you wish within the SecurityAlert table.
    - If we start typing in, watch it, let's put in securityalert, but we going to put it in all lowercase letters.
  - If we try to run this query, we are going to get a SYNTAX ERROR
    - That's because the table names are case sensitive
    - If we were to put in SecurityAlert in proper or initial caps and then run it, now we have some results showing up down there
    - Now when you're constructing these log queries, you can start to type things in, we are going to put in a space
    - We are going to type in a vertical pipe, which is a pipe symbol
    - We want to take the result of what's on the left and feed it into something on the right 
    - Such as counting the number of occurrences or ordering them or summarizing them or doing something of that nature
    - Let's say, for example, that we want to run a search
    - Type in the word search in and then specify the name of the table
    - We know that the name of the table is going to be case sensitive
    - SecurityAlert, It would tell it that we are looking for ssh
    - We could even, if we really wanted to, pipe it and tell it we want to only take, let's say, 5 entries.
  - Then, of course, what I'm going to do is click Run to run that query
    - We can see the result of the query is now showing down below
    - We've got some security alerts for Failed SSH brute force attacks
    - In your environment, you'll be able to click the Save button to save the query so you can run it in the future
    - This is not a complicated query that we've got here, it's a one liner
    - But sometimes it can get quite complex and you're going to want to reuse them as opposed to recreating them every time
    - You'll find them by going into the Query explorer under Saved Queries.
    - You can also go into Azure Monitor. So Azure Monitor up at the top, just click Monitor.
  - Monitor is simply a way to bring together a lot of your different log information throughout your entire subscription, for example
    - So let's say here in Monitor, we were to click on Logs over on the left.
    - From here we can select a scope. So let's say, we select Pay-As-You-Go subscription and click Apply
  - Now we're in the very familiar interface where we can begin running our queries
    - We can also navigate different types of tables
    - And of course we can see the columns so we can start building our queries 
    - And working with the results and saving them and getting to them from the Query explorer.


Dashboard Queries
  - You can run Azure log queries from within specific resources or from a Log Analytics workspace, or even from Azure Monitor.
    - We are going to go into Monitor by searching for that in the portal here in the top search bar and choose Monitor
  - Azure Monitor brings everything together in one location. So that you can query Logs for items
    - For example, in the scope of your entire subscription, or it could be a resource group
    - But at any rate here, we've got a default workspace Log Analytics workspace object selected here.
  - We could choose Select Scope and change that up if we so chose, but we are going to leave it as it is 
    - Because all that we want to do is just run a basic query here
    - We are going to look in the Heartbeat table and let's say we run it
  - Well, there are no results found for the Last 24 hours, but how about we go back 7 days and run that again?
    - Think of a Heartbeat as being a "I am alive" type of message sent by computers in Azure
    - We can see down below, we do have some activity related to that, including showing the ComputerIP addresses
    - Now, we know that we can save log queries, we could click the little Save button here.
    - We can give this a name and save it as either a Query or a Function.
  - If you save it as a Function, then you could call that from another query using the short name of the function
    - But at any rate, and then you can specify a Category, that's fine but we can also pin this to a dashboard.
    - We are going to go ahead and click the Pin to dashboard button here.
    - We could choose an existing one or create a new one, we are going to create a new one and call it Dashboard1.
  - It's going to be for my Pay-As-You-Go subscription and we can specify the Location, it can be any.
    - Then we are going to choose Apply.
    - In the portal, you can search for dashboard at any time up in the bar and to choose Shared dashboards.
    - We can see Dashboard1 listed here, so we are going to click to open that up.
  - However, it says No data for the given query. And if I try to refresh the update, still no joy
    - Now, that's because it's the Past 24 hours by default, so there's no data to show for that
    - So let's choose the Past 7 days, then we can click Apply.
  - After a moment we should see that we have our result for Heartbeat messages sent from computers
    - At this point, it says This dashboard has unpublished changes, e just changed the time range filter, go ahead and choose Publish changes.
    - This way, we can put the types of resultant log query information that's relevant to us at the time on a dashboard for quick access.
    
                    
Performance Metrics
  - Using performance metrics and monitoring them in Azure helps you optimize the performance of resources
    - For things like virtual machines or for web applications, if you're using, for example, Application Insights to track the performance of a web app.
    - Let's open up an existing virtual machine here in the portal to view its individual performance metrics. 
  - Now we can do that by scrolling down in the navigation bar or the properties for that VM
    - All the way down under the Monitoring section where we can click on Metrics.
  - Over here on the right, we can select a metric from the drop-down list
    - For example, we are going to go down, let's say into the P's and choose Percentage CPU
    - We can see that the CPU performance metric has been mapped on a chart.
    - We can see the percentages going up on the left. And it's plotted against a timeline going across the bottom from left to right.
  - But you can also click the Add metric button to add more than one metric on a single graph
    - So for example, maybe we are interested in some other metric like Disk Write Bytes if we are interested in disk performance.
  - Now we've got both items plotted, we can see by the legend that in this particular case, the Disk Write Bytes is shown in red
    - We can track that performance metric separately from my Percentage CPU
    - If we hover over any of those metrics, it allows me to zoom in on that specific metric
    - Because it's highlighted and everything else is dimmed on the graph
    - We can also pin this to a dashboard so that we have an easy convenient way to look at this
    - Instead of coming in each time we're interested in this and setting it up from scratch. 
    - If we go back to the Overview blade for this VM over on the right, if we scroll down. 
    - We can also see some standard performance metrics, which by default shows me activity for the last hour, we could choose the last 7 days
  - Where we can see the CPU usage average, the network traffic total, we can see the disk bytes total, disk operations per second
    - We've got a lot of these items that are here automatically by default, search here in the search bar in the portal for monitor
    - Azure Monitor is a centralized tool that allows you to also view performance metrics from here, instead of from an individual resource
    - Now from here I have to select a scope.
  - This is different because we're not already in a resource like a VM, so it doesn't know what to show us
    - We have to select a scope, we can drill down within a subscription and then ultimately within a resource group
    - We could even select, for example, a Log Analytics workspace.
  - What we could do here is we have the ability because notice that we can expand and collapse our subscriptions
    - This is a way for you to be able to monitor performance metrics across different subscriptions by adding different scopes
    - We are going to add a Log Analytics workspace here and then we will click Apply.
  - Now what you have to think about is the data sources attached to that Log Analytics workspace
    - So the specific virtual machines or storage account logs
    - Because from there you'll be able to then determine which specific metrics you might be interested in. 
  - For example, if we were to choose, let's say Disk Writes/sec, then we will have some information plotted 
    - That is available based on all of the information that's made available to that Log Analytics workspace.
