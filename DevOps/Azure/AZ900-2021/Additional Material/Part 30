Action Groups and Alert Rules
  - Instead of going to each and every resource in Azure to monitor the performance, you can configure instead alerts
    - Alerts can send you notifications through your configuration of what are called action groups
    - This way, you are notified when there are issues based on your configured thresholds
    - Instead of you having to go through and peruse all of your Azure resources, which is much more time consuming
    - So let's get started with this. First thing I want to do here is open up an existing Log Analytics workspace
  - The reason we are doing this is because a Log Analytics workspace is a centralized logging hub
    - Where if we scroll down in the navigation bar, we have a number of different types of data sources 
    - That can feed their performance metric and log data into this Log Analytics workspace
    - As a result, we can configure some alerting here within the Log Analytics workspace
    - So if we scroll down under the Monitoring section in the left-hand navigator, there's Alerts.
  - Now these are alerts that will be specific to this Log Analytics workspace
    - Before we create an alert rule, we are going to first click on Manage actions
    - When we do that, we can create a new action group, we can add an action group
    - There might be some that are here already based on what you might have configured previously, but we are going to add a new action group.
    - This action group is going to be used for notification for administrators, we are going to call it AdminNotify.
  - The short name will be the same because the Short name field is required
    - The next thing down below is to add an action type, you can add multiple action types to this action group
    - We can see here we can trigger an Automation Runbook or an Azure Function
    - Or we can have an e-mail message sent or in our case we want an SMS text message sent. 
  - We are going to select that item, that's going to open up a new blade 
    - Where we are going to turn on the check mark for SMS and we are going to specify a phone number.
    - The next thing we need to do is supply a name, so for the example we are going to call it TextITDirector. 
    - Then click OK, we've got my action group configuration created and it now shows up in the list, it says AdminNotify.
  - Go back into the Alerts for our Log Analytics workspace, in the Alerts blade or view, click New alert rule.
    - We want to create an alert to be notified when something happens
    - In this case, specifically be notified through an SMS text message based on the phone number we've configured
    - The resource here in the alert rule is already specified
    - It's a specific Log Analytics workspace and it could be based on something else
    - We mean we could have done this, we could have configured an alert for a specific virtual machine for example
    - In this case, the resource is the Log Analytics workspace, we now have to add a condition, so under CONDITION click Add.
  - For the Monitor service in the upper right in that drop-down list, we are going to choose Platform
    - We are going to see platform-specific items and filter the list for processor and there we should see, % Processor Time.
    - We are going to select that item to configure a condition.
  - We want to look for busy or overburdened processor utilization
    - Scroll down and we can select a specific dimension if we want to filter or zoom into a specific Computer or an ObjectName and so on.
  - We don't, we just want it overall, what want to do is essentially to be notified when we've got an 80% Greater than, 80% on Average of CPU utilization
    - Now we can see the frequency of evaluating this type of condition which is going to be every minute
    - We can see the Aggregation granularity (Period) is set to 5 minutes, go ahead and click Done.
  - We've now got our condition whenever the CPU processor utilization is above a certain amount
    - Then we have to go down and apply this to an action group. We don't have an action group selected, but we just created one recently
    - Then we are going to go ahead and click on Add.
    - There's the AdminNotify action group where we've got 1 SMS text message that will be sent so choose Select.
  - Then all the way down at the bottom, we have to give this a name
    - We are going to call this alert rule example BusyCPU, and scroll down further and click Create alert rule.
    - If we have any issues related to that alert rule, they will show up here in the Alerts blade or the Alerts view.
    - We can also use our action groups and configure alerts for an individual resource as we've alluded to.
  - Let's say for example that we opened up an individual virtual machine here in the portal.
    - What we could do is scroll down in its navigation bar on the left, and go down under Monitoring and there's Alerts.
    - When we go into Alerts, it's the same type of interface that we just saw.
  - For example if we click Manage alert rules, we will see any alert rules created for this specific resource of which there are none
    - We could click New alert rule, and could go through and configure the same type of thing we did.
    - The difference being that the resource is a specific VM as opposed to a Log Analytics workspace
    - We could go through the same types of motions and add a condition for it. 
    - When it comes to the action groups, if we click Add, then we would see our global list of action groups including AdminNotify.


Application Insights
  - One common use of Microsoft Azure is the deployment of customized web applications
    - So developers will always be interested in monitoring how the app is being used and how it's performing, we can do that by enabling Application Insights.
    - In the portal, to do that, we are going to create a new web application.
  - During the creation we are going to make sure we enable Application Insights, you can also turn it on after the fact.
    - When we go to create a web app, there are some common things that we need to fill in.
    - Including the resource group it will be deployed into, a name for it.
    - We are just going to put in a unique name here, custom name.
    - And we are going to use a code-based application, just choose here, let's say ASP.NET.
    - We are able to deploy this in any region of our choosing.
  - It's going to create a new application service plan, App Service Plan
    - That's fine, it determines the underlying horsepower and the pricing tier, accept the default for the sizing
    - We are going to click Next on monitoring, so Next: Monitoring.
  - This is where we want to make sure that Application Insights is enabled, it is, it's set to Yes
    - It's going to create a new Application Insights resource, it's pretty much got the name of our web application which is perfect
  - We are going to go ahead and choose Next, and continue all the way through accepting defaults by clicking the Next button.
    - Finally, we'll click the Create button to create this web app where App Insights is actually enabled now.
    - We can now see our deployment is complete, click Go to resource to go into the web application.
    - Where in the left-hand navigation bar, scroll down under the Settings section
    - We will see Application Insights we are now going to click to open up that blade.
  - We're over on the right, we can see it's enabled, this is where you can enable or disable it
    - We can see that it's connected to my Application Insights resource
    - There's a separate resource that's created and there's a link to it here, which we will click on.
  - In the Overview blade of the App Insights object, so that's what we're looking at now, over on the right
    - We can see some performance metrics such as Failed requests for the app, Server response time, Server requests, and overall Availability. 
  - If we click Live Metrics over on the left, after a moment we'll get some new live metrics related to my application
    - So Incoming Requests, Request Duration, failure rates, and so on
    - For developers, this is going to be absolutely crucial so that they might know what to tweak within the application to optimize performance.


Network Performance Monitor
  - In Azure, the Network Performance Monitor tool allows you to monitor and identify network problems
    - Whether they're related to firewall issues or maybe they're related to routing configuration errors.
  - Either way, here in a Log Analytics workspace, when you want to work with the Network Performance Monitor, you have to add it here
    - Here's what that means, if we scroll down in the left-hand navigation bar for this Log Analytics workspace
    - We can then click on Workspace summary over on the left.
  - Now you're not going to see the Network Performance Monitor listed here by default. It's showing up here because we've already added it.  
    - What you would normally do is click the Add button up at the top and you would search for Network Performance Monitor.
    - You could add it by selecting it from the marketplace, here it is
    - Network Performance Monitor from Microsoft, but we've already got that done
    - We are going to go back here to the Overview where the Network Performance Monitor panel is listed here.
  - When you first go into that, you're going to be configuring it, so go ahead and click on the Configure link up at the top.
    - And then on the left we are going to click SETUP.
