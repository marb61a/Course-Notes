Action Groups and Alert Rules
  - Instead of going to each and every resource in Azure to monitor the performance, you can configure instead alerts
    - Alerts can send you notifications through your configuration of what are called action groups
    - This way, you are notified when there are issues based on your configured thresholds
    - Instead of you having to go through and peruse all of your Azure resources, which is much more time consuming
    - So let's get started with this. First thing I want to do here is open up an existing Log Analytics workspace
  - The reason we are doing this is because a Log Analytics workspace is a centralized logging hub
    - Where if we scroll down in the navigation bar, we have a number of different types of data sources 
    - That can feed their performance metric and log data into this Log Analytics workspace
    - As a result, we can configure some alerting here within the Log Analytics workspace
    - So if we scroll down under the Monitoring section in the left-hand navigator, there's Alerts.
  - Now these are alerts that will be specific to this Log Analytics workspace
    - Before we create an alert rule, we are going to first click on Manage actions
    - When we do that, we can create a new action group, we can add an action group
    - There might be some that are here already based on what you might have configured previously, but we are going to add a new action group.
    - This action group is going to be used for notification for administrators, we are going to call it AdminNotify.
  - The short name will be the same because the Short name field is required
    - The next thing down below is to add an action type, you can add multiple action types to this action group
    - We can see here we can trigger an Automation Runbook or an Azure Function
    - Or we can have an e-mail message sent or in our case we want an SMS text message sent. 
  - We are going to select that item, that's going to open up a new blade 
    - Where we are going to turn on the check mark for SMS and we are going to specify a phone number.
    - The next thing we need to do is supply a name, so for the example we are going to call it TextITDirector. 
    - Then click OK, we've got my action group configuration created and it now shows up in the list, it says AdminNotify.
Let's go back into the Alerts for our Log Analytics workspace. And in the Alerts blade or view, I'm going to click New alert rule.
I want to create an alert to be notified when something happens. In this case, specifically be notified through an SMS text message based on the phone number we've configured. So the resource here in the alert rule is already specified. It's a specific Log Analytics workspace. It could be based on something else. I mean we could have done this, we could have configured an alert for a specific virtual machine for example. But in this case, the resource is the Log Analytics workspace. Now we have to add a condition. So under CONDITION, I will click Add.
So for the Monitor service in the upper right in that drop-down list, I'm going to choose Platform. I'm going to see platform-specific items and I'm going to filter the list for processor and there we go, % Processor Time.
So I'm going to select that item to configure a condition.
I want to look for busy or overburdened processor utilization. Then I'm going to scroll down and I can select a specific dimension if I want to filter or zoom into a specific Computer or an ObjectName and so on.
But I don't, I just want it overall. So what I want to do is essentially I want to be notified when we've got an 80% Greater than, 80% on Average of CPU utilization. Now we can see the frequency of evaluating this type of condition which is going to be every minute. And we can see the Aggregation granularity (Period) is set to 5 minutes. So I'm going to go ahead and click Done.
So we've now got our condition whenever the CPU processor utilization is above a certain amount. Then we have to go down and apply this to an action group. We don't have an action group selected, but we just created one recently. So I'm going to go ahead and click on Add.
There's the AdminNotify action group where we've got 1 SMS text message that will be sent, and I'm going to go ahead and choose Select.
  - Then all the way down at the bottom, I have to give this a name. So I'm going to call this alert rule BusyCPU, and I'm going to scroll down further and just click outside of that, and then I can click Create alert rule.
    - If we have any issues related to that alert rule, they will show up here in the Alerts blade or the Alerts view.
    - We can also use our action groups and configure alerts for an individual resource as we've alluded to.
  - Let's say for example that we opened up an individual virtual machine here in the portal.
    - What we could do is scroll down in its navigation bar on the left, and go down under Monitoring and there's Alerts.
    - When we go into Alerts, it's the same type of interface that we just saw.
  - For example if we click Manage alert rules, we will see any alert rules created for this specific resource of which there are none
    - We could click New alert rule, and could go through and configure the same type of thing we did.
    - The difference being that the resource is a specific VM as opposed to a Log Analytics workspace
    - We could go through the same types of motions and add a condition for it. 
    - When it comes to the action groups, if we click Add, then we would see our global list of action groups including AdminNotify.


Application Insights
  - One common use of Microsoft Azure is the deployment of customized web applications
    - So developers will always be interested in monitoring how the app is being used and how it's performing, we can do that by enabling Application Insights.
    - In the portal, to do that, we are going to create a new web application.
  - During the creation I'm going to make sure I enable Application Insights, you can also turn it on after the fact.
So when I go to create a web app, there are some common things I need to fill in.
Including the resource group it will be deployed into, a name for it.
So I'm just going to put in a unique name here, custom name.
And I'm going to use a code-based application, I'll just choose here, let's say ASP.NET.
I'm going to deploy this in Canada Central as a region.
And it's going to create a new application service plan, App Service Plan. That's fine, it determines the underlying horsepower and the pricing tier, I'm going to accept the default for the sizing. I'm going to click Next on monitoring, so Next: Monitoring.
This is where we want to make sure that Application Insights is enabled. And it is, it's set to Yes. And it's going to create a new Application Insights resource. And here, it's pretty much got the name of my web application. That's fine, perfect. 
So I'm going to go ahead and choose Next, and continue all the way through accepting defaults by clicking the Next button.
Finally, I'll click the Create button to create this web app where App Insights is actually enabled now.
We can now see our deployment is complete, I'm going to click Go to resource to go into the web application.
Where in the left-hand navigation bar, if I scroll down under the Settings section, I'll see Application Insights. I'm going to click to open up that blade.
  - We're over on the right, we can see it's enabled, this is where you can enable or disable it
    - We can see that it's connected to my Application Insights resource
    - There's a separate resource that's created and there's a link to it here, which we will click on.
  - In the Overview blade of the App Insights object, so that's what we're looking at now, over on the right
    - We can see some performance metrics such as Failed requests for the app, Server response time, Server requests, and overall Availability. 
  - If we click Live Metrics over on the left, after a moment we'll get some new live metrics related to my application
    - So Incoming Requests, Request Duration, failure rates, and so on
    - For developers, this is going to be absolutely crucial so that they might know what to tweak within the application to optimize performance.


Network Performance Monitor
  - In Azure, the Network Performance Monitor tool allows you to monitor and identify network problems
    - Whether they're related to firewall issues or maybe they're related to routing configuration errors.
  - Either way, here in a Log Analytics workspace, when you want to work with the Network Performance Monitor, you have to add it here
    - Here's what that means, if we scroll down in the left-hand navigation bar for this Log Analytics workspace
    - We can then click on Workspace summary over on the left.
  - Now you're not going to see the Network Performance Monitor listed here by default. It's showing up here because I've already added it.  
What you would normally do is click the Add button up at the top and you would search for Network Performance Monitor.
And you could add it by selecting it from the marketplace, here it is. Network Performance Monitor from Microsoft, but I've already got that done. So I'm going to go back here to the Overview where the Network Performance Monitor panel is listed here.
So, when you first go into that, you're going to be configuring it. So I'm going to go ahead and click on the Configure link up at the top.
And then on the left I'm going to click SETUP.
This is what you're going to see the first time you come in. It wants you to install the OMS agents, the monitoring agents within your hosts. Now if you added virtual machines to this Log Analytics workspace. They automatically already have the Microsoft monitoring agent extension installed. So it's already done. You can also tweak and configure performance monitoring.
You can also tweak and configure service connectivity monitoring such as for Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics.
You can also monitor ExpressRoute dedicated circuit connections.
So over on the left, I'm going to click NETWORKS.
I've already added a couple of networks here. I've got my default network and I can see the subnetwork range for that VNet is 10.0.1.0. But I've also already added VNet9 here. You can click the Add network button and just fill in the details for the network name. And you'll be able to select an unallocated subnet that it's detected down below here. So I've done that and I've called it VNet9. 
IThen if I click on SUBNETWORKS over on the left, 'll see the subnets that stem from those virtual networks.  
And if I click on NODES, I can see here I've got three virtual machines in Azure. They're up and running. The AGENT STATUS shows as being Healthy. Now these three virtual machines in my case are added to this Log Analytics workspace. And as we've mentioned, they automatically get the monitoring agent installed, so they're good and ready to go. 
And if I click PERFORMANCE MONITOR on the left, I can click add a rule.
Now when I add a rule over on the right, I can select a network, I can select a subnet, and I can choose connectivity to another subnet.
I can add exceptions and I can tell it I want to use ICMP versus TCP to test the connectivity.
  - We can determine when it will generate an alert if the connectivity between those subnets is not available
    - The default is to autodetect sudden change, but we can say if there is a loss
    - Apacket condition loss, greater than or equal to a certain percentage
    - Or latency, network latency, speed greater than or equal to a certain number of milliseconds
    - Network latency means network slow down issues, we can have that trigger
    - Once we've got that done, then our rule will show up, we can go back to the overview here for our workspace summary.
    - That's when, when you come into Network Performance Monitor, you get to see here that you've got some problems.
  - Potentially, hopefully not. So we know that within a Log Analytics workspace
    - If we scroll down and look at the workspace data sources that virtual machines can serve as a data source.
  - We've got a couple of them here, WinSrv2019-1, -2 and 3, they're added to this workspace
    - Of course, we can just click on it to open it up and connect or disconnect it.
  - Once you actually connect a virtual machine to a workspace, the Microsoft monitoring agent is automatically installed in the VM.
    - That way the VM can report back to this Log Analytics workspace, so just flip over and take a look at one of those virtual machines.
    - If we actually click to open it up, and if we take a look at the virtual machine extensions.
  - What will have been added because it won't have been there before is the Microsoft Azure monitoring dependency agent
    - That gets installed when you connect or link that VM to a workspace
    - Now in the case of Network Performance Monitoring, that's going to be important.
  - If we take a look at the result of our configuration. If we go under Workspace summary here in the Log Analytics workspace.
    - We could see that now that it's had time for those servers to start reporting back information about network connectivity
    - We're going to start seeing some potential alerts, we can see there's an alert here
    - There's 1 of 1 subnetwork link that is considered unhealthy. 
  - If we click on that panel to open it up, then we can read more details about exactly what the issue is
    - We can see that that health event was generated by a rule called Rule1
    - If we kind of click on that rule to see what it's about, we've got a 100% transmission loss.
  - We can see it's between subnets within the rule that were specified
    - In this case, those subnets are the 10.0.1.0 subnet, and the 13.0.1.0 subnet
    - There's a link on the right that says View affected node links, we could also click on that to get even further detail
  - From here we can see the node links where on the left we have the name of a virtual machine
    - It's pointing to another one listed to the right of it
    - We can see the IP address interfaces, and we can see in this case we have a 100% packet loss
    - That often might be due to routing problems between subnets and so on
    - But this is one of the overall purposes of using Network Performance Monitor or NPM in Azure
    - To identify these types of network connectivity issues.


Network Watcher
Before you can troubleshoot network connectivity issues in Azure, you need to be aware of the network configuration. You've got to know what's there. How many VNets, subnets, VNet peering is enabled and so on.
So here in the portal, I'm going to search for network and I'm going to select Network Watcher from the list.
One of the things I can do here is click on Topology over in the left-hand navigation bar to open up the Topology blade.
Now on the right, it's got my subscription automatically selected from the Resource Group drop-down list. I'm going to choose a resource group I'm interested in here.
And I can also select a VNet to further filter my topology map.
It draws a topology map in a hierarchy, where at the top, we have our virtual network. In this case, it's called VNet1 under which we then see the subnets. And this is part of knowing what you have. If you're called in to troubleshoot something and you didn't set it up, it's helpful to know what's there. So we can see we have a number of subnets, including a GatewaySubnet, an AzureFireWallSubnet, an AzureBastionSubnet. And under each subnet we can then see the associated network interfaces and ultimately the public IP addresses associated with those interfaces and of course the virtual machines. So this is one of the things we can do with the Network Watcher tool, is learn a bit about our topology in the Azure environment. Over on the left, I can also click on Connection monitor.
So I can click the Add button over on the right to add a connection monitor.
I'm going to call this Monitor1.
And I'm going to select a virtual machine here that would be a virtual machine that is the source I want to monitor from and then I want to select a destination virtual machine.
I can also specify a port number on which I want that connectivity to be checked.
So I'll put in Port 80 and I'll just click Add to add that connection monitor.
And we can now see the monitor has been added to the list and under the Status column it says it is currently running.
Now we can actually click on that connection monitor configuration and that'll open up another panel down below where we can scroll down and see some details over the last hour, six hour all the way up to the last 30 days. And down below according to the legend, we can see that we've got percentage of probes that have failed is 100. That's not good. Well, that could be due to a number of reasons. Perhaps the target virtual machine isn't reachable due to routing problems, but if they're in the same subnet, it's not a routing issue. Or it could be a network security group preventing connectivity to a port. Or perhaps Port 80 simply isn't in a listening state on that machine, there's no web server. So there are plenty of reasons that could happen, but we can identify that this is happening here using Network Watcher. We can also run a Packet capture as we can see over here on the left, we can view our Effective security rules, network security group security rule.
So from here we can select the subscription, a resource group and ultimately a virtual machine.
So when I do that I can see a network interface for that virtual machine and the association with the network security group here at the subnet level that says as opposed to linked directly to the network interface, and we can see any rules that might be applicable.
We can also click on Packet capture on the left and click the Add button to add a packet capturing session.
Sometimes you'll create a packet capturing session because you want to be able to actually examine the detailed specific network traffic that is occurring on a network.
Now specifically what you're going to do is to choose the target virtual machine that you're interested in and you can select to store the resultant packet file name, the packet capture file name in a storage account. Or you can have it stored in a file within the virtual machine in question, the target virtual machine that we have to select above or you can have it stored in both places. The packet capture file will use a .cap format. So you can open it up with standard tools like Wireshark.

                    
Azure Subscription Overview
There is a relationship between Azure AD tenants and Azure subscriptions. 
Pictured in our diagram on the left, we see our Azure AD tenant. Azure AD or Azure Active Directory is a centralized directory service in the cloud. And it allows us to create user accounts for authentication, organize them into groups, assign permissions. We can register devices in Azure AD, so users can sign in on those devices with their Azure AD credentials. That's essentially what it is. It's an identity provider. And we can associate a subscription with our Azure AD tenant, listed here as Subscription 1.
A subscription is really a way that we get features that allow us, for example, to deploy resources in Azure. It's also used for billing purposes. But what you can do is you can add multiple subscriptions to your Azure AD tenant. However, the opposite is not true. You can't have a given subscription used by multiple AD tenants. So we see here that subscriptions are related to billing.
Now there are some limits to what you can do within an Azure subscription, such as how many resources can be deployed and so on. As an example, our first item here is the number of subscriptions per Azure AD tenant. This is one of those items where there is no limit. But there is a number of resource tags that can be specified to an Azure resource, and it maxes out at a value of 50. The maximum number of group owners maxes out at 100. The maximum number of storage accounts per region maxes out at 250. Now, this is only to list a tiny portion of some of these limits. There are many other ones that are published online, clearly, in the Microsoft Azure documentation.
So we have the option with our subscription to also increase any of these limits should they be a little bit too constraining. You can do this once you sign into the Azure portal by creating a customer support request. Now limits for some things, such as the number of vCPUs, virtual CPUs available for a given virtual machine instance, those limits are quoted per Azure region. Now, you also have to bear in mind that if you're using an Azure free trial subscription, that you won't have the option of creating a customer support request, at least not in it succeeding in increasing any of those limits.
The other thing to think about is that when it comes Azure subscriptions, don't forget about how it is related to both the Azure AD tenant and also your Azure account in the first place. So you can have your Azure account in which you build your Azure AD tenants, and of course, you can have multiple subscriptions. Billing is done separately for each of your subscriptions. And if you do have a free try, you can actually convert it to a paid subscription.
Now there are a number of different types of Azure subscriptions, such as pay-as-you-go, where all of your resource usage is tracked and you pay based on what you use. But then depending on the type of support you need, will determine if you select some of the other types of subscriptions, like Professional Direct support or Developer support. Developer support would allow you to get support but only during business hours, not 24/7. Then we also have Standard support. So, if you do need full support, 24/7, then you would look at choosing the appropriate type of Azure subscription, such as Professional Direct.


Azure Subscriptions and the Portal 
  - You can view your Azure subscriptions in the Azure portal
    - One way to do this is by searching for subscriptions in the search bar at the top center 
  - Now bear in mind that when you search up subscriptions you will see any subscriptions associated with your current Azure AD tenant
    - Which is shown here as Quick24x7, we can see that we have a Pay-As-You-Go active subscription and can even see the Current cost.
  - In the upper right, if I click on my sign in account information area and click Switch directory and, if I choose some other Azure AD tenant, let's say EarthFarm in this example.
Then when I go to take a look at subscriptions, I can expect to see something different potentially.
So because I've visited subscriptions recently, I can just click it from Azure services, of course, I could once again search for it in the top center. Either way, I want to look at the subscriptions for this different Azure AD tenant. Notice it says, "You don't have any subscriptions". So at this point, we have the option of clicking Add where we'll be presented with a list of subscription options.
So at this point, I'm just going to authenticate so I can get to that screen. So now I get the option to SELECT AN OFFER.
If I want to add a Pay-As-You-Go subscription or Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test, Developer support, Professional Direct support, and Standard support where I can see some of the details about these. So we have some options here. And, if I were to choose one of these, it would then continue on to the point where I have to make sure I add a payment method, and so on. But I'm going to close out of that. And I'm going to switch back to my first initial directory that in this case would be the Quick24x7 Azure AD tenant where I know, I have an active subscription.
And once again, I'm going to go look in the subscriptions associated with that Azure AD tenant. Now I'm going to click directly on that existing subscription.
Now I'm going to click directly on that existing subscription. 
Because when you do that, it opens up a plethora of options in the navigation bar on the left. For example, we can go to Cost analysis to analyze costs, to see exactly for example, where the lion's share of our charges are coming from.
We could click on Budgets, so we can configure alert notifications when our costs reach a certain point.
We can even go through and see our Invoices over on the left under the Billing section. But at the same time, we also have some other things that we can do, when I go back to the Overview part of this.
We have some buttons across the top. I can cancel the subscription. I can Rename it, so, if I want to rename it from Pay-As-You-Go to something different, I can do that. I can Change directory. That means I can associate this subscription with a different Azure AD tenant. So I've got a number of options. So, I can even click on Manage to open up a new browser window where I can further manage my Azure subscription. So we have a summary for our Pay-As-You-Go subscription, where we're looking currently at the OVERVIEW.
And we can see a lot of options available on the right to Manage payment methods or to Download usage details for the subscription or to change the subscription address information. Or I want to switch to a different type of subscription offer. Again, I have some other options here such as canceling the subscription and so on.


Azure Subscriptions and the CLI
You can use the Azure CLI to learn about Azure subscriptions and also to determine which subscription is active. To get started here in the Azure portal, I'm going to launch the Cloud Shell.
Now in the Cloud Shell, I'm going to start by running az account list.
And when I press Enter, it'll return some details.
So we can see the name of the cloud, AzureCloud, as opposed to Azure Cloud for Government or anything like that. And we can also see the id. Now, it doesn't say subscription ID, but this is the id of our current Azure subscription. We can also see our Azure AD tenant ID. Let's examine the subscription ID for a second by jumping into the portal to take a look at that. So, notice here it starts with 048b and ends with 2109. So let's just minimize the shell here. Let's go in to Subscriptions, let's see what we've got attached to our current AZ tenant.
Now it should be a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. And notice the Subscription ID indeed starts with 048b and ends with 2109. So we can learn a bit of that information from the az account list command in the CLI.
Let's clear the screen. Let's also run az account set --subscription. And here, I'm going to put in the name of it which is Pay-As-You-Go, each word separated by a dash. Now in my case, it doesn't really matter that I do that.
Because if we go back and take a look, we've only got a single subscription here associated with our Azure AD tenant. Which is shown here by name in the form of Quick24x7.
But when you have multiple subscriptions, this can be an important command. Essentially you're setting the context to that subscription. And so following commands after you do that will run in the context of that set or selected subscription. The other thing to bear in mind is that you can also, instead of setting the subscription when you have multiple subscriptions, you can also do it per command. What I mean by that as an example, is let's say we were going to use az vm create to create new VM. And normally you would specify things like --resource-group and then Rg1, let's say.
  - Then maybe the name, let's call it Linux1, and then maybe the --image would be based on something Ubuntu
    - But the key here is that we can also use the --subscription command line parameter
    - And so, for this individual single command, you can say, well, we want this tied to the Pay-As-You-Go, just type that in, subscription
    - You can do that if you know you have to work with a number of resources and different subscriptions
    - You might choose to just do it at the command-line instead of keeping on setting it as up above
    - It really depends on what you want to do and how many commands you have to issue
    - But either way, it's important to have this knowledge if you're going to be working with Azure subscriptions through the CLI.


Azure Subscriptions and PowerShell
  - When you're working in PowerShell, you might be working with an Azure AD tenant that is associated with multiple subscriptions
    - And, so you can control the subscription that is going to be used as you issue PowerShell cmdlets. Such as the deployment of resources like virtual machines. To get started here in the portal, I'm going to launch the Cloud Shell, and I'm in PowerShell here.
  - We go to start by running get-command. And I'll put in asterisk subscription. So basically, I'm trying to discover which cmdlets are available that relate to subscriptions.
And there are bunch of them as you can see. For example, Get-AzSubscription. Okay, so if we were to do that, get-azsubscription, when we press Enter, we get some returned information.
We can see that we have a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, which is currently active and being used. So, if we start deploying virtual machines and storage accounts and so on, it's going to be tied to this currently active subscription. We can see the subscription ID. We can also see the Azure Active Directory tenant with which the subscription is associated.
Now, when you have multiple subscriptions available for your Azure AD tenant, you may want to be able to switch between them. And you can do that using select-azurermsubscription. So for example, in quotes here I could do it by name, pay-as-you-go, close the quotes.
What this means is, I'm setting that as the current context or active subscription. Any commands that follow will be tied to it. Such as deploying virtual machines, storage accounts and so on. And I can verify that, that's the current context by running get-azurermcontext.
And we can see it returns that we are using our Pay-As-You-Go subscription. And of course, we can see the subscription identifier being listed there as well along with our Azure AD tenant ID. So now that we've done that, any PowerShell cmdlets that I run from this point forward in this session will be applied to that subscription.


Management Group Overview
Azure management groups are really all about centralized governance. Now we can apply this to multiple subscriptions, it allows us to organize subscriptions within a management group. Think if it as a hierarchy. Because at the top, you have your tenant root group. Under which you can then create multiple management groups and organize your subscriptions accordingly within them. Now you would organize them for policy and compliance reasons.
For example, you might have a policy that requires SQL database encryption. And you want to check all SQL database instances in multiple subscriptions. So, you might organize those subscriptions into a management group and then assign that policy to the management group. You can have up to six levels deep of subordinate management groups. If you so need that change. So down here, we see we have the management group hierarchy.
At the top you have your tenant Root Management Group, by default. And underneath it on the left we have Management Group 1 where we could organize subscriptions. We see here Subscription 1 and Subscription 2. But then on the right we have another management group, Management Group 2, under which we have a different subscription, Subscription 3. So we can apply or assign policies to Management Group 1.
And whatever that policy says should happen, such as checking for SQL database encryption, will flow down and be inherited. And be applied to all SQL database deployments in Subscription 1, and Subscription 2 in all resource groups. And the same thing would be true, if we applied a policy to Management Group 2, it would only apply to, in this case, Subscription 3. Now, we've really only got one level in our hierarchy here of management groups that we've created. Bear in mind, you could have up to six. So, the way that this works is we would add subscriptions as per usualto our Azure account and associate them with Azure AD tenants.
We can then create one or more management groups. Then we can move subscriptions under the appropriate management groups. And then we can apply our governance options, in other words, assign policies to management groups. Which in turn means that the subscriptions in the management groups will inherit that policy assignment.


Configuring a Management Group
If your organization's use of Azure includes the use of multiple Azure subscriptions it can be a little bit cumbersome to apply permissions at the policy level to resources in multiple subscriptions.
For example, if you want to limit something such as virtual machine types that can be deployed in certain regions. Instead of doing that per subscription, if you have the same requirements for the subscriptions. You might organize those subscriptions first into a management group and apply that policy to the management group. It'll flow down and be inherited by all of the subscriptions. So it works well in that sense. So let's go ahead and see how that works in the portal. I'm going to go ahead and search the portal for management and I'll choose Management groups.
Now you always will have your default Tenant Root Group under which subscriptions exist. Here I can see my Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
But you can organize a hierarchy, kind of like how you would organize a hierarchy of organizational units or a use in on-premises Active Directory, to organize resources. In this case, we would be creating management groups to organize our subscriptions. Now even though, I only have a single subscription, I'm still going to go through create a management group and then move that subscription into that management group part of the hierarchy. The first thing I'm going to do. I'm going to click Add management group in the upper left.
I need an ID for it. I'm going to call it mgmt1111 and I'm going to call this MgmtGroup1, then I'm going to click Save.
Now, if you've got multiple subscriptions, let's say tied to a particular business unit, you might name your management group in relation to that business unit name. 
Or if it's for particular project, maybe name the management group the name of the project or something along those lines. After a moment, we'll see that our management group down below is listed.
And if I click on it and open it up, there's nothing in it because we haven't moved any subscriptions there yet. So I'm going to go back to my Tenant Root Group where I see my subscription
Pay-As-You-Go. And over on the far right, I'm going to click the more context menu, so the three dots and I'm going to choose Move. It's as simple as choosing the target management group that you want to move the subscription under.
Well, there's only one there MgmtGroup1, that we've just created a moment to go.
So I'm going to select that and choose Save.
In after a moment the subscription disappears here from the Tenant Root Group and if I drilled on into MgmtGroup1, well we're going to see that our subscription is now listed there.
So the reason we would do this is, so that we can essentially apply centralized governance across multiple subscriptions in Azure. Let's see how that would work. So let me search for policy up here in the search bar. I'll choose Policy.
So what I'm going to do is take a look at assigning a policy to a management group. So I'm going to click Assignments over on the left. Any assignments that we already have will be shown.
I'm going to click the Assign policy button. Now the first thing we'd have to deal with is the Scope.
Where do you want this policy assigned? Well, let's go down and choose a policy definition, so we at least have something to think about here. Maybe I'll search for encrypt.
And I want to make sure a disk encryption is applied on virtual machines. 
Now if your organization has six policies, well, then you potentially would have to configure this six times for each policy scope. The scope would be the subscription level. But here we can go one level above that, because subscriptions can be organized into management groups. So I'm going to select that policy.
And up above, notice it automatically assumes that we want to apply this policy definition and scour VMS looking for disk encryption within only the Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
But I'm going to click the scope selector button over on the right. Now I could choose a different subscription, if I had others or even on a Resource group within the subscription where I want this policy applied, but that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about management groups which we see at the top. So here's MgmtGroup1, I can select it, and then choose Select. And we are now applying this policy definition to scour all subscriptions under MgmtGroup1, looking for machines where disk encryption has not been applied. They'll then show up in compliance reports.

Azure Cost Analysis
One important aspect of cloud computing is being able to manage costs, even though it's often pay-as-you-go, you get charged for your resource consumption. You want to make sure that you are tracking it and identifying where most of those charges are coming from. So we can do that by looking at Azure cost analysis.
To get started here in the portal, I'm going to go into Subscriptions, because billing occurs at the subscription level.
So I've got a Pay-As-You-Go subscription listed here, I can see the Current cost, and I can see that it's Active.
So I'm going to click directly on the subscription.
Because when I do that, I get this new navigation bar on the left, and one of the things I see is Cost analysis, which is precisely what I want to do right now.
Knowing that I have a specific dollar amount based on my Azure usage is not enough. I want to know how it's broken down. So here for example, we can see it's Canadian dollars. It's only $1 and 48 cents. And we can see that it's charted here. I'll just scroll little bit over to the right according to days of the month as we can see, and it looks like the usage has been increasing since about March 4th. Now, if I scroll down a little bit, we can also see the Service name breakdown. Well, where is that money being spent? Is it virtual machines? Is it storage? Is it databases? Well, we can see by looking under Service name at this graph, that we've got the bulk of it coming from SQL database.
Little bit coming from virtual machines and storage. And we can also then see it's broken down here by Location, well, which regions. We might have different Azure administrators using our Azure account to deploy resources in different Azure regions. So I can see the cost here per region that looks like all of the cost is stemming from the US East region. Now, depending on how you use resource groups to organize related Azure resources it will determine how useful it is to look at the cost per resource group.
Often many organizations will create resource groups for specific apps that might have multiple components like a web server type of app. And it might have some custom code. It might have a back-end database. All of those resources might be organised in one resource group and then you can see the charges per resource group. So basically, in that example, you'd be able to see the charges per web application. Or you might have resource groups for different departments, if that make sense in your organization or different projects, and then deploy resources into them accordingly. And again, you'll then be able to see the cost breakdown per resource group. It really depends on what your requirements are. And you can also click the Export button to export this information as a PNG type of graphic file or as Excel data or as a CSV file.
And then you can download the charts. You can also schedule the export of this information on a periodic basis maybe to a storage account for business analysts that might require this type of cost breakdown.
Now, we can also get a little more granular at the top by clicking Cost by resource.
Now, why is this useful? Because it's showing us the individual Azure resources, like specific SQL servers that were deployed specific virtual machines, disks for virtual machines, storage accounts, and so on.
And we have a cost associated with it over in the right hand column.
So it's just a way to really drill right down to the specific deployed resources that are incurring costs in your Azure account through your subscription.


Azure Budgets
While it's important to analyze costs and pore over the numbers, it's also equally important to save time and get notified when costs on a monthly basis exceed a certain value. And that's where Azure budgets come in as being useful.
So I'm going to click here in the portal on Subscriptions. I see, I have a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, which I'm going to click on.
Now we know that we can click on Cost analysis, and of course, that is very important.
But we're talking here about getting notified when a certain threshold value is exceeded. So for that, we're going to go to Budgets over here on the left.
Now we don't have any budget shown on the right.
So I'm going to go ahead and click Add. The first thing you have to think about is the scope to which you want the budget applied. What do you want to look at costs for, do you want to look at it for your entire subscription?
I can click Change scope and from here, I could switch to a different directory.
Right now, I'm using the Quick24x7 Azure AD tenant. And we could also drill down, for example, under our root management group for our tenant. So I can click that.
I can then click down on a management group, perhaps that's the level where I want to apply my budget.
But I can also click on the management group and then go down under my subscription, and even go down into a specific resource group.
So you have all of these scopes that you can apply your budget to. I'm just going to Cancel out of there. We're going to leave it directly on our Pay-As-You-Go subscription.
I could also click Add filter, because maybe what I want to do is filter by something specific. So for example, I could specify that I want to look at a type of service I want to filter on. Or maybe a ResourceLocation, so we can choose a specific region if we wanted to filter on that.
However, I'm going to click the x to remove the filter, I don't want to apply that.
Next thing I need to do here is, I need to specify a unique name for the budget.
So I'm going to call this Budget1.
Now the Reset period will be on a monthly basis, but I could change that to whatever time period makes the most sense for me. I could set an Expiration date.
I'm going to leave those default settings, and I'm going to set the budget amount. For example, I want to know once we're exceeding $500 a month. Now to help along with this, down below, I can see last month's costs. And I can see the past six months' cost, and the maximum monthly forecast cost. So based on those small values, perhaps 500 is a little large. So maybe for example, if we get above a 100, which might be indicative of abnormal cloud usage in our particular case, then we can put that value in.
Now having done that, I'm going to scroll down and click on the Next> button. Now up at the top, if I scroll back up, we can set alerts.
So when we get to a percentage of that value, let's see when we get to 80% of our $100, then we want to have something happen.
So we can work with an Action group. Now the Action group allows me to specify things like, what you want to occur. Now, do you want to trigger some kind of code, or do you want to trigger some kind of a notification? And I even have a Manage action group option here. If I click on that, it'll take me in where I can see what I could do, what could be triggered when 80% of our budget is reached.
So I could click Add action group, maybe what I want to do send something like an SMS text message.
So I'm going to call this AG1 for action group 1. Same thing for the Short name, which is a required field, as indicated by the red asterisk.
And down below, what I want to do is Select an action type.
In this case, it's going to be Email/SMS/Push/Voice.
And let's say that I want to send SMS text notifications. So it's country code, and I could just fill in the number. After I've done that, I would then go down and click OK. Now, of course, it wants me to fill in a valid phone number. So we'll just change it into something else. All 5s in a phone number is actually reserved and used for works of fiction like movies and television shows. So I'm just going to go ahead and leave that as it is for SMS. So we're just basically adding this specific type of notification. And I'm just going to call this TextMsgNotify. This is in my action group AG1, and I'll click OK.
And essentially, we want to be able to use that within our budget.
So it's showing up in the list. I'm just going to go ahead and select it to get back to where we were in configuring our notifications.
So I'm just going to scroll back here, we've got AG1, and let's just go back here. So that's where we want this to be showing up.
And after a moment, you might have to go to the previous screen and back, you'll see the group. So here it is, AG1. Down below, I can also specify, of course, the recipients' email. So I'm just going to scroll over to the right so I can see my scroll bar, there it is.
So maybe, I've got a group called admins@quick24x7.com, and I want them to receive notifications, so in addition to our SMS text messaging. Okay, so having done that, I'm just good to go down and create the budget.
And there you have it, the budget creation succeeded, we now have our budget called Budget1.
And we can expect to be notified when we get to 80% of our budgeted value in the currency specified for the subscription, in this case, CA$100.00.


Azure Invoices
While the use of cloud computing can mean less capital expenditures for IT services. Such as, not having to acquire a lot of on-premises physical computing hardware. We still have to be able to track charges in the cost on a per-use basis by reviewing invoices.
So to get started here in the Azure portal, I'm going to click on Subscriptions.
Now, the subscription of course is tied to an Azure AD tenant which is shown here as being Quick24x7. My subscription is called Pay-As-You-Go. I'm going to go ahead and click on it to open up this navigation bar which gives me options related to my subscription.
One of which, if I scroll down under Billing, is Invoices.
Now, we can see on the right that we have the Last 3 months worth of invoices shown. We can see the Billing Periods, starting and ending. We can see the date of the invoice. And we can also see the Amount. And we can see the Type, in this case it's for Azure Services. Now we also, if we scroll to the right, have the option of downloading each of these. Now, if I click on the download link, it's a CSV file format download or it could be a PDF.
Now, this could be important for accounting reasons and certainly for business expense or taxation reasons. So this is something that we can do by looking at the invoices. But notice also that each of these specific dollar amounts for each invoice is a hyperlink, it's blue.
And so, if I were to click directly on it, I could actually jump into the Cost analysis for that particular invoice.
So I can see for example, looks like premium solid state drive or ssd managed disks. Were really the bulk of the cost for that particular invoice within that time frame.
Followed by, it looks like, virtual machines. So we can see how this breaks down. We can even filter it.
If I want to click on Filter items, we could start typing things in and then filtering based on that.
So for example, if I put in ssd, all we're doing now is looking at SSD charges related to the time frame listed up above.
So I'm just going to go ahead and click the X to close out of that. Now, it's one thing to come here and view the invoices. But we want to try to avoid having to do things in the sense of thinking of doing it. We want to automate things. And we can click the Email Invoice option up at the top.
Currently it says, You are not receiving emailed invoices. Well, that's something I want to do. So I'm going to click on Opt In to make that happen.
I acknowledge that it's going to be sent via non-encrypted email. That's fine, I Agree.
So this could be an important aspect of your configuration when it comes to having your invoices emailed to you automatically. The other thing to think about is we have this Access Invoice button up at the top. Now, this is currently On.
And it would apply for example to users in your subscription that would have roles such as the the billing reader role. So we have that option available as well.
Also notice that the default here, Timespan is listed as being 3 months. But you can click on that and change it.
So for example, I can set it to the Last year if that's what I want to see.
And sure enough, we now see our invoices for the Last year.
