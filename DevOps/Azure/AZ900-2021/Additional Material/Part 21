Policy Compliance
  - While you can use Azure Policies to limit resource management in the Azure environment
    - You can also use it to check for compliance, such as with security standards.
  - To get started here in the portal, we are going to search for Policy up in the top bar
    - We are going to open up the Policy tool, where the first thing we should do is look at any existing policy assignments.
    - Bear in mind that when you make a policy assignment, such as at the subscription level for that type of scope.
  - Depending on how many objects are in your subscription will determine how long it takes before you can expect compliance reports
    - For example, we've got an assignment here for a policy called Disk encryption should be applied on virtual machines
    - That's been applied at the Pay-As-You-Go subscription level.
  - When we go to the Compliance view, if it's not yet had time to run we have to just wait 
    - And click on Refresh until such time we start getting some information
    - For example, we can see the Disk encryption should be applied on virtual machines compliance report here for the Pay-As-You-Go subscription
    - Currently the Compliance state is Non-compliant, so 0 out of 1
    - It means we have zero out of one applicable item that are compliant with that.
  - If we take a look at that by opening it up, opening up the assignment details
    - Then when we scroll down towards the bottom, we'll see the offender
    - What is the one item that was not compliant?
    - Well, in this case we're talking about disk encryption, which applies to a virtual machine, shows us the name of the virtual machine
    - We can see the Compliance state for it is that it's Non-compliant.
    - If we click on the Details link for that, we'll get a bit more insight as to what's going on.
    - Here it says, No related resources match the effect details in the policy definition. In this case, looking for encrypted disks.
  - By viewing these compliance reports, we can determine whether certain machines are compliant with security standards such as this one
    - If not, we know where to focus our energy to bring those devices into compliance.


Policy Remediation
  - You can configure remediation tasks for certain types of Azure Policies when it comes to non-compliant resources.
    - An example of this would be a custom policy that uses the modify policy effect. Let's take a look at this here in the portal. I'm going to start by going to the Azure Policy tool.
  - We'll first start by looking at an existing definition for a custom built policy.
So I'm going to change the Type drop-down list here on the right to Custom, there it is. Add Cost Center Tag, going to click to open up that custom policy definition, and let's take a look at the definition down below.
What's happening is we're looking for a tag in resources called CostCenter.
Now, depending on where we assign this policy will determine what it's going to look at.
Is it going to look at all resources in the subscription or just certain ones in a resource group? Depends on where this custom policy is assigned at which scope level. So if there is not a CostCenter tag, so if that works out to be false, what should we do?
Well, we want to add a CostCenter tag with an appropriate value. So then the effect is modify. 
And what we want to do is make sure that we add a specific tag, in this case the CostCenter tag, with the value of YHZ.
Now, this will certainly apply to newly created resources, they will automatically have this tag added. But for existing ones, we'd have to check the compliance. So let's see what that looks like. 
Let's close out of here, and let's go back to our Compliance view over here on the left, where we can see our Add Cost Center Tag has been applied to the Pay-As-You-Go or subscription scope.
And we can see that currently the state is Non-compliant, 0 out of 34 resources are compliant with that. So if we click on that, we'll be able to see the resources in question. In this case, it's going to be any resource that does not have that tag value.
So, CostCenter with a value of YHZ. We can scroll down and we can see the identity of those specific resources. So for example, the first one is a virtual machine called winsrv2019-1. Over on the far right, if I click the three dots button, I can select the Compliance reason to see why it's not compliant.
It's not compliant because the CostCenter tag doesn't even have a value, so there's nothing there. It needs to have a value of YHZ. 
So what I can do is create a remediation task by clicking that button of the same name up here at the top. 
When you create a remediation task, you are remediating in alignment with what that policy says should exist. In this case, that's the Add Cost Center Tag policy that wants the CostCenter tag with the value of YHZ to be applied. So we have a list of the resources here in our subscription that really need to be remediated and have that item added, that tag. So I'm going to go ahead and click the Remediate button at the bottom. And we can see a remediation task has successfully been created.
And it shows it here, when we're looking at our Policy compliance, we can see under the Remediation tasks tab that it's currently In Progress. So back here in our Compliance view, if we click Refresh, we can see that for our Add Cost Center Tag custom policy, the non-compliant state is changing.
 It will take a bit of time, we can keep on clicking the Refresh button. But now we've got 86% resource compliance. 
So if I click to open that up, let's go back and take a peek at the status of our remediation task. So if go to the Remediation tasks, we can see its Complete.
And if I clicked on it, then we'll be able to see some further detail.
  - Just because it's complete, it doesn't mean that every resource in the subscription has been modified to be compliant. It means that it's complete in that the instructions have been sent, it just might not completely be done. So here we can see the resources against which that modify effect for adding that tag value has succeeded. So for example, for vnet1, a virtual network, let's take a look at that. If we actually click to open up that resource, did it or did it not automatically tag it?
    - We will take a look so we are going to go Tags
    - If there were any tags here already, we'll see those in addition to the new one
    - We apparently had a tag here called Project with the value of ABC
    - Now we can see CostCenter: YHZ has been added. And this is a result of having created a remediation task.

                    
Azure AD Role Overview
  - In Azure Role-Based Access Control, otherwise called RBAC is a way to delegate permissions to others to manage Azure resources.  
    - There are a number of built in roles that you can select from or you can define your own custom roles if they don't suit your needs
    - Some examples of built in roles include the owner role.
  - If you have the owner role, you have full resource management control of all resources in Azure
    - We haven't yet talked about the scope of where that applies, but unto itself that's what it means
    - Think of an RBAC role as being a collection of related permissions
    - You've got the contributor role. So resource control, other than changing RBAC access
    - Reader role, which implies read-only access. Other examples would include CDN endpoint reader for Content Delivery Network endpoint reader
    - You can read endpoints, but that's it, can you configure them?
    - Cost Management contributors you can read and write Azure cost configurations 
    - Including working with budgets, virtual machine administrator login as it implies
    - You can read VMs in the portal and login with admin credentials.
  - There are many more built in roles than that, that's just to give us a sampling of what we might expect
    - But you can also work with custom roles, maybe you need one role that combines virtual machine and cost management permissions for example
    - What you would do is create a custom JSON role file, this is just a text file that uses JSON syntax
    - You have to know what that syntax is to properly define the role, and then you can create the role from that file
    - For example in PowerShell, you can do that with the New-AzRoleDefinition cmdlet, or in the CLI you might use AZ role definition create.
  - Working with a custom RBAC role file uses JSON syntax, you could even type this into your favorite text editor, it doesn't matter
    - Notice we've got the opening and closing curly braces at the very top and the very bottom
    - The first item we see defined here is the "Name": custom VM roles It's got its own ID, the IsCustom flag third line down is set to true
    - We have a Description, and then we have a collection of actions
    - What are the permissions grouped together here within this role?
    - So it looks like we have a bunch of read access to all items indicated with the asterisk in storage, network and compute
    - And then the ability to start and restart virtual machines, this is what we would see within a custom RBAC role definition file.
  - Now we can assign roles, whether they're built in or custom at a variety of levels within the hierarchy in Azure
    - But before we get to that, let's talk about which principals we can assign it to
    - You can assign roles to users individually, but it's normally easier to do it on a group level
    - You just add members to the group, they get the permissions for the roles assigned to the group
    - You could also do it for service principles, think of a service principle as being kind of a dummy user account used by software
    - It's not actually user logging in, it's a software component that might require access, let's say, to some other resource like a storage account
  - Then you've got managed identities, this is something this is a built in type of security principle that's managed automatically by Azure
    - This would be used for example, if you're a software developer, you building custom solutions in Azure that need to authenticate to certain Azure services
    - So depending on what you're working with, will determine whether Azure creates the managed identity or not, let's say that we've assigned a role to a group
  - Where does that apply in the Azure hierarchy? we can assign that at the subscription level
    - Which means that the group members would have those permissions from the role for everything in the entire subscription
    - It flows down through the hierarchy down to resource groups and down to individual resources in resource groups
    - However, you could also assign RBAC roles to a specific resource group
    - Naturally those permissions would only apply for resources in the resource group
    - If you need to be very granular, you can also assign it to a specific resource
    - Let's say you need to allow a virtual machine login for a group for one particular virtual machine
    - You can certainly do that by assigning the scope for that particular virtual machine resource.


Azure AD Role Portal Assignment
  - You can use the Azure Portal to assign roles and also to view where the roles are effective. 
    - We're talking about Role-Based Access Control, or RBAC
    - To get started in the portal search for subscription, and go to the subscription level, because we want to start by applying a role there
  - Then we can examine how those permissions flow down the hierarchy
    - That means to resource groups within the subscription and within resource groups to individual resources, start by opening up a subscription
  - When you want to assign RBAC roles, regardless of which level you're doing it at, you always go into the properties of the item, in this case, the Subscription. And in the navigation bar, you click on Access control (IAM). Now from here, you'll be able to see any role assignments.
You can choose to View role assignments.
So if I click View, I can see that listed over here on the right, but I can also +Add role assignments, which we're going to do. So I'm going to click +Add, Add a role assignment. And the first thing I need to do is select the appropriate Role.
I can choose from the alphabetical list of role names. And bear in mind that a role is really just a collection of related permissions. So what I'm going to do is type in the word virtual just to filter this out. And we'll see here we've got a Virtual Machine Contributor role, which allows with the creation of virtual machines and management of them. So I'm going to leave that as the Role.
Now I can assign the access to Azure AD users, groups, or service principals.
So what I'm going to do here is take a look for a group by the name of east. And sure enough, I have an existing Azure AD group I've created previously called EastAdmins. I want to assign this role to that group. So EastAdmins is now showing up down below as a selected member.
I'm going to save that.
Now at this point, we want to check our work right here at this level, at the subscription level. So I'm just going to scroll over a little bit to the right so we can kind of see everything, including our scroll bar. And at the subscription level, notice for the Virtual Machine Contributor role, EastAdmins is part of that. And we can see that that is a Group and that it was assigned at the Scope of This resource. Now why don't we take a look at a resource group somewhere within the Subscriptions.
So for that I'm just going to go to Home, actually, I'll just open up my navigation bar on the left, and I'll just choose Resource groups.
I'm going to open up the properties of an existing Resource group.
And we know that to get to the RBAC portion of that item, we need to click on Access control (IAM), so I'm going to do that.
Now I don't want to make a role assignment here, what I want to do is View role assignments, so I'm going to click the View button. And I'm just going to scroll over just a little bit so we can see what's happening here.
And as I scroll down, notice that EastAdmins has the Virtual Machine Contributor role that is effective here in my resource group. However, it says Inherited, and it was inherited from the Subscription level. So why don't we go into an object within this resource group to take a peek.
So for example, if I click on Overview here for the resource group, one of the things I'll be able to do is see the resources down below that are in that resource group. It doesn't matter which one I pick. I'm just going to click on this network security group to open it up.
And as is the case with what we've been looking at so far to get to the RBAC section, we click Access control (IAM), so this is for an individual resource.
  - View the role assignments over on the right, and we'll see, of course, that Virtual Machine Contributor EastAdmins is shown here with inheritance coming from the Subscription level.
    - That's all that we need to do to be able to grant permissions to Azure resources through the use of roles in the portal.


Azure AD Role CLI Assignment
RBAC roles can be assigned using the Azure CLI.
Here in the portal I'm going to click on Cloud Shell to start up the CLI, and I'm going to start by creating a role assignment using az role assignment create.
The first thing I have to do is specify the name of the role that I want to grant, in this case --role and in quotes, "SQL DB contributor". I then have to determine who the assignee is with the --assignee parameter who you assigning this to. Now it could be a service principle and Azure AD group, in this case, it's an Azure AD user, specifically jhill. And then I've got the full email address or user name of that account. I want to make sure that the SQL DB contributor role is assigned to jhill, and I want the scope to be a resource group. So --resource-group, and Rg1. Could go ahead and press Enter to create that role assignment.
And it looks like it's good. We've got some returned JSON, and we can check our work here in the portal. Let's just minimize this.
Let's go into the Rg1 Resource group to see if user J Hill is shown there with the SQL DB Contributor role.
So I'm going to go to Access control (IAM) for Rg1.
And what we want to do in there is View the role assignments, so I'll just go ahead and click on that, scroll over a little bit and let's go down and take a peek.
Sure enough their SQL DB Contributor and Jen Hill is a member of that role at this level, This resource. It wasn't inherited from the subscription, so let's go back into the CLI.
So I can also view assignments from within here, of course as you might imagine, so az role assignment list --, let's say resource group rg1 since that's what we just looked at in the portal.
And we can see here that user principalName J Hill is assigned here.
And we can also see that the roleDefinitionName is SQL DB Contributor, and this is for the resource group of course Rg1 that we asked for, up above in the command line.
We can also remove role assignments from here as well.
To do that I would use the az role assignment delete command syntax. I need to specify the assignee, so --assignee, and it's going to be the user we just added here in this example, jhill. And have to specify the role because she might be assigned with multiple roles at that level, so --role SQL DB Contributor. And the scope where that was applied, that I want to remove it from, is the Rg1 resource group. So let's go ahead and press Enter. Now, that's going to remove that role assignment.
So I'm just going to use the up arrow key, back to where we were listing role assignments for resource group 1, or Rg1. And notice now nothing is returned.


Azure AD Role PowerShell Assignment
PowerShell cmdlets can be used to manage RBAC role assignments. Here in the portal, I'm going to launch the Cloud Shell to access those PowerShell cmdlets.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure web portal opens. He clicks an icon called “Cloud Shell” and the PowerShell command prompt window opens. The following prompt is displayed: PS /home/danlachance72>. [Video description ends]

The first thing I'm going to do is create a new role assignment. Now to do that, I'm going to use the New-AzRoleAssignment PowerShell cmdlet. I'm going to use the -SignInName parameter. And I'm going to assign this to an Azure AD user jhill@quick24x7test.onmicrosoft.com. Now I could also apply this to a service principle in Azure AD or a group. But in this case, it's an individual Azure AD user. I have to specify the RoleDefinitionName, so I'll specify that parameter. In this example, it's going to be the SQL DB Contributor. And as we know when we work with RBAC, we have to determine the scope where the assignee can exercise those privileges. In this case -ResourceGroupName, Rg1. I could specify a subscription or an individual resource, here I want it done at the resource group level. So I'm going to go ahead and press Enter.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: New-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName jhill@quick24x7test.onmicrosoft.com -RoleDefinitionName "SQL DB Contributor" -ResourceGroupName Rg1. The output displays the details of the role assignment. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Now we can verify this using PowerShell cmdlets. So I'm just going to clear the screen and what we're going to do, is we're going to retrieve role assignments for Rg1 for that user.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: cls. The screen gets cleared and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

To do that, I'm going to use Get-AzRoleAssignment -ResourceGroupName is Rg1, that's where we just assigned it. -SignInName is going to be our user J Hill. Let's go ahead and press Enter and see what it returns.
So we're seeing that user Jen Hill has been assigned the SQL DB Contributor role. And of course we asked for this at the Rg1 resource group level so she has those permissions for SQL database deployments within the Rg1 resource group. Now naturally, we need to know how to be able to remove role assignments using PowerShell.
We know how to add them and check them, what about removing them? We do that with the Remove-AzRoleAssignment PowerShell cmdlet. As you might expect, in this case, we're going to use -SignInName and specify our Azure AD user sign in name, the email address. I'm going to specify the role with -RoleDefinitionName. It's going to be SQL DB Contributor. And I have to apply that to a scope. Where do you want to remove that from? Well, that would be -ResourceGroupName of Rg1, so I'm going to go ahead and press Enter to remove the role assignment.
We're going to check our work. I'll use the up arrow key to bring up previous commands.
Up to where we get back to Get-AzRoleAssignment and when I press Enter, nothing is returned because user J Hill no longer has that role assigned in Rg1.


Azure AD Custom Roles
If the built in roles for RBAC in Azure don't meet your needs, you can then define your own custom roles in a JSON formatted file as I've got open here. So it's a JSON formatted file, it's just a text file really.
I've got the opening and the closing curly braces. And here, I'm defining the Name of my custom role to be Custom - Network Resource Reader. IsCustom is set to true and I've also got a description here that says, Ability to view network resources. Then you have to define what this role's actions are, what can someone do in terms of permissions if they are assigned this role. So here for actions, I'm specifying Microsoft.Network/*, so all Microsoft Network types of resources in Azure, but the ability to only read them, read.
There are no definitions for NotActions, only actions that we want to allow. And for the AssignableScopes here, I've set it at the subscription level with the ID of my Azure subscription. So now, how do we take this and create a custom role? Well, there are a number of ways that that can be done. We can do this in PowerShell and that's actually what I'm going to do here. So the next thing I need to do is launch the Cloud Shell so I can get to a place where I can issue PowerShell commands.
So I'm going to go ahead and launch Cloud Shell. Now, the first thing I have to think about is that the file that we just looked at for our custom JSON role definition was on-premises. I need to get it up here in the cloud in Cloud Shell. So I've got this button at the top here in the bar where I can upload and download files. I'm going to go ahead and click Upload/Download files, and then I'll choose Upload. So I've specified my file and it looks like the upload has completed. So the first time you open Cloud Shell, you're asked to set up storage. And this is one of the reasons so you can have persistent storage of items that you might deal with, in this case, a file I've uploaded. If I do dir, I can see indeed, there's the Create_Custom_Role.json file that we were just looking at in WordPad just a few minutes ago.
So what I want to do then is I want to make sure I create a new role from this. So I'm going to do that with the new-azroledefinition PowerShell cmdlet. I'm going to pass it the -inputfile parameter with the value of, in this case, create. And I can even use my tab completion to spell out the rest of it since I'm in the same subdirectory. Let's see what happens. I'm going to go ahead and press Enter to create this custom role, and it should be done.
Now, we can check this here in the portal. So again, it's called Custom - Network Resource Reader. So let's say we were going to go to the subscription level and apply that role.
So I'm going to go into my subscription.
We know that in the GUI when you want to work with RBAC, you go into Access control (IAM). So I'm going to do that.
And one of the things that we're going to do here is click +Add, Add role assignment.
And, we have a unified drop down list here of both built in and custom roles. Now remember, our role starts with the word custom. And you can actually select it from the list, or you can even filter the list if you so choose.
So if I type in custom, we can see right away, Custom - Network Resource Reader. That's the role we just created. And we can see the description here, Ability to view network resources. That's what we've just created. Now, you can also remove that from PowerShell. So let me just go back here into PowerShell.

[Video description begins] He closes the page. He switches back to the PowerShell command prompt window. [Video description ends]

Let's get rid of that.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: cls. The screen gets cleared and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

I'm going to run get-azroledefinition, and I'm going to specify the name of it, which is going to be Custom - Network Resource Reader, the spaces between those items. Now when I do that, all it does is return that yes, that role is there, that definition exists. So I'm going to bring up that command again with the up arrow key.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azroledefinition -name "Custom - Network Resource Reader". The output displays the details of the role. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

What I want to do is pipe the result of that to the remove-azroledefinition cmdlet. So we're going to retrieve that specific role and pass it through and delete it. Are you sure you want to do, or we can actually suppress that message.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azroledefinition -name "Custom - Network Resource Reader" | remove-azroledefinition. A confirmation message appears. [Video description ends]

Let me just Control+C out of there.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So, if I bring back that full command again, I can just add -force, if I could spell that over correctly over here. And it will suppress that message so it will remove that role.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azroledefinition -name "Custom - Network Resource Reader" | remove-azroledefinition -force. No output is displayed and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So if we use our up arrow key to go back a little bit, where we were getting that role definition, it no longer exists.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azroledefinition -name "Custom - Network Resource Reader". No output is displayed and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Resource Locking Overview

[Video description begins] Topic title: Resource Locking Overview. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

The purpose of Microsoft Azure resource locks is to control when others can modify or delete Azure resources of any type, whether that's intentional or unintentional.

[Video description begins] Azure Resource Locks. [Video description ends]

So it's a way to basically check out a resource, so to speak. And while it's checked out, in a manner of speaking, it can't be either modified or it can't be entirely deleted. We can set resource locks at the subscription level. And similar to how you apply RBAC roles at the subscription level and it flows down to everything in the subscription, like resource groups and resources, the same thing is true with Azure resource locks. If you set a resource lock at the subscription level, it will flow down to resource groups and resources. You could, of course, apply an Azure resource lock initially at the resource group level, or you might lock an individual resource such as a storage account, to prevent the modification of its properties. Now you can set the Azure resource lock to be read-only.

[Video description begins] Azure Resource Lock Levels. [Video description ends]

What that means is you are allowing read-only access to the item, so that it can't be reconfigured, so to speak. Or you could set it to not allow deletion or to prevent deletion of the resource.

[Video description begins] Azure Resource Lock Inheritance. [Video description ends]

So the inheritance, as we've mentioned, starts at the subscription level, then applies to resource groups, and then applies to individual resources. Now if you don't want that, in other words, you don't want the locking applying everywhere, simply specify the lock at the resource group or the individual resource level.

[Video description begins] VM and storage account are displayed as the individual resources. [Video description ends]

And you can disable or unlock the subscription, the resource group or the resource, at any point in time, once you've deemed it appropriate to allow modifications or the potential for deletion. Bear in mind that modification and deletion of an Azure resource is only possible anyways if somebody has the appropriate permissions to do so, which is usually granted through RBAC roles.


Resource Locking and the Portal
In Microsoft Azure, a resource is an object that you define in the cloud, such as a virtual machine or a disk that you would attach to a virtual machine or a storage account or a SQL server. Any of those things are resources. And so we have the ability to use the portal to lock resources. Why would you do that? You would do it because you want to prevent either a modification of a resource, you want it to be read-only, or you want to prevent the deletion of it.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure web portal opens. [Video description ends]

So we can set locking at various levels in the Azure hierarchy, such as at the subscription level. Now, that's what I'm going to do.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Subscriptions option and the corresponding page opens.[Video description ends]

For example, here if I go into the subscription, I'll be able to open it up, to reveal its properties, and I am interested primarily in resource locking.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Pay-As-You-Go row entry and the corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to scroll all the way down under Settings where I see Resource locks.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called "Resource locks" and the corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

Any existing resource locks at this level will be shown. It says This resource has no locks. Okay, well, I could click +Add, and I could add a lock at this level.

[Video description begins] A section called "Add lock" opens. [Video description ends]

And when I do that, I specify a name and I can determine if it should be a Read-only lock, so to prevent modifications, or if I want to prevent deletions.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button called "Cancel". [Video description ends]

 I'm not going to do that though I could, but I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going to navigate to Resource groups.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called "Resource groups" from the left-hand navigator and a page called "Resource groups" opens. [Video description ends]

So what I want to do then is take a look at the resource locking options at the Resource group level, which would be inherited by the resources in the Resource group. I'm going to click on my resource group Rg1.

[Video description begins] The corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. [Video description ends]

And in the Overview blade, one of the things you'll see over on the bottom right are the resources in that resource group. So let's scroll down in the navigation bar and let's take a look at resource locks. So it's listed a little bit differently here. Under Settings, it just says Locks.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called “Locks” and the corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

If we take a look, we'll see if there are any locks that have been made here. Now, we've got the Subscription icon where we could take a look at subscription level locks.

[Video description begins] He clicks an icon called "Subscription" and a page called "Resource locks" opens. [Video description ends]

We were just there a few moments ago.

[Video description begins] He clicks a link called “Rg1 | Locks” and the Locks page opens. [Video description ends]

It's just a shortcut to get there. However, we can also add locks at this specific level for this particular Resource group.

[Video description begins] He points to Rg1. [Video description ends]

So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to click Add. And I'm going to call this, let's say Lock1. And I'm going to set it as a Read-only lock here.

[Video description begins] He clicks a drop-down list box called “Lock type” and selects an option called “Read-only”. [Video description ends]

I could add Notes if I so chose, I don't choose to so I'm just going to click OK. And after a moment, we can see that Lock1 shows up here as Read-only for resource group 1. If I click Subscription once again, then we can see that it shows up at the subscription level and we can see the Scope that it's applied to is only rg1.

[Video description begins] The Resource locks page opens. [Video description ends]

Notice, you can Edit it to change any settings related to that or Delete that lock.

[Video description begins] He switches back to the Locks page. [Video description ends]

 If I go back to the Resource group, you can see the lock here.

[Video description begins] He clicks a link called "Lock1" and a page called "Edit lock" opens. [Video description ends]

And if you click on it, it'll pull up the items where you can modify its settings. But you can't delete it from here, you'd have to go to the subscription level and that's to be expected. Now, let's take a look at some of the resources within Rg1.

[Video description begins] He closes the page. [Video description ends]

We can do that by just scrolling up, clicking Overview. We'll see any resources deployed into this resource group, as we mentioned previously, listed in the bottom right.

[Video description begins] The corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

For example, here's a resource group called, or pardon me, here's a network security group NSG called NSG-Windows.

[Video description begins] A blade called "NSG-Windows" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. [Video description ends]

If I click to open it up, we'll be able to look at the Locks for that particular individual resource.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called "Locks" in the navigation pane and the corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

When I click Locks here, notice we can see Lock1 is applied Read-only. And it says Parent resource locks, can't edit them here. Click on the locks scope to go to that scope. Okay, so we'd have to go up to in this case rg1 to take a look at it. But interestingly, if we try to delete this resource, so let's say go back to Overview and normally we'll just go to Delete here.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called "Overview" in the navigation pane and the corresponding page opens in the content pane. He clicks a button called "Delete" and a message box labeled “Delete network security group” opens. [Video description ends]

And normally, if you have the role permissions to do this it would succeed. Let's go ahead and say, Yes get rid of it.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button called “Yes”. [Video description ends]

It says, I can't do it, cannot do it because there is a lock.

[Video description begins] Another message box opens. [Video description ends]

And it's at the Rg1 level. So therefore, that's not going to happen. It's read-only, which will also prevent modifications here to this particular object.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called "Inbound security rules" and the corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

So for example, if I go to Inbound security rules, let's say I go to +Add a new rule, we'll just fill in a couple of blanks here really quickly.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button called "Add" and a page called "Add inbound security rule" opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to accept all of the defaults and I'm going to click Add.

[Video description begins] The page closes and a message box opens. [Video description ends]

Well, it didn't even like that. So I can't even modify it, let alone delete it. Bear in mind, we set a read-only type of lock at the resource group level and it's flowing down at the resource level. So to get rid of all of this, what I could do is go up to the subscription level, as we saw because that's where it allows us to actually delete locks.

[Video description begins] He switches back to the Subscriptions page. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to do that, I'm going to go back into my Pay-As-You-Go subscription. And I'm going to scroll down and look at Resource locks.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Pay-As-You-Go" row entry and the corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

And we'll see the resource lock applied at the resource group level.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called “Resource locks” and the corresponding page opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to take a look at that.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Lock1" link and the "Edit lock" page opens. [Video description ends]

Now of course, we can only edit what's there, but if we scroll to the right to see what's over on the far end, there's the Delete option.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Cancel button and the page closes. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to press Delete, and now it's gone.


Resource Locking and the CLI
Resource locking can be managed using CLI commands just as well as it can be done using the portal.
So I'm going go into the Azure CLI and I'm going to start by using the az -h command because I don't know what the syntax is. So there's a lot of stuff here, the next level commands after az.
I'm going to guess it might be in the Rs for resource lock, but I don't see anything like that. Okay, not that. I'm going to next guess that it's somewhere in the Ls. Here it is, lock, Manage Azure locks.
So therefore, I can do az lock -h to try to figure out how to proceed from here.
So, to Create a lock, Delete a lock, list locks, and so on. Got it. So, I'm going to run az lock create, and I'm going to create a lock here called Lock2.
And I'm going to set it at the resource group level. I don't have to, I could set it at the subscription level. I could even set it at an individual resource level. But commonly, you would find it would be done at the resource group level, in this case, Rg1. I'm going to specify --lock-type and I'm going to set it to readonly. So I want to prevent modification, which also includes preventing deletion. So it's called Lock2, this looks good.
Let's check it out in the portal to see what it looks like in Rg1. So let's see.
I'm going to go to my navigator up here on the left and go to the Resource groups view, where we are going to see Rg1.
I'm just going to go ahead and click to open that up.
Let's go down and check the locks for it shall we. So scroll down and we're going to take a look at the locks, there it is, Locks. And we can see that Lock2 Read-only has been set here.
And again, it's been set at this level rg1. Now of course, if we scroll over to the far right, we can choose to Edit or Delete it. We could also go up to the Subscription level, where we'll see all the locks in the subscription, even if they weren't tied to the subscription levels.
There it is. And from here, we can also Edit and Delete it at that level. But of course, we can also do that in the CLI.
Back here in the CLI, for example, we might run az lock list.
And here, we'll see that we do have a lock that's applied it's called Lock2, it's been applied to Rg1, and the locking level has been set to ReadOnly.


Resource Locking and PowerShell
You can use PowerShell cmdlets to manage resource locking in Azure.
To get started here in PowerShell, I'm going to run get command and I'm going to search for any cmdlets that have resourcelock in their name. So I'm going to pad the string resource lock with an asterisk on either end. So as long as it's got resource lock in the name, I want to see the cmdlet.
And right away we can see for instance, New-AZResourceLock to create a new lock, or Get-AZResourceLock to retrieve a list of locks through Azure. We even have the option to remove or set a lock.
And if I wanted more details on any one of these, I could run get-help, let's say a new-azresourcelock. I could ask for detail, and maybe pipe it to more to stop after the first screen full of output.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-help new-azresourcelock -detail | more. The output displays the details and syntax of the command. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Here I can see the syntax for this cmdlet, including the parameters, such as -LockId, -LockLevel and so on, even to the point where I'll see an example of how I can actually create a resource lock.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Let's get started by retrieving resource locks with get-azresourcelock. I'm going to press Enter.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azresourcelock. The output displays the details related to resource lock. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So it looks like we already have a lock called Lock2 that has been applied to a resource group called Rg1. And the level we can see here has been set as ReadOnly. So what I want to do is remove that lock. In order to do that, I need to get this LockId.

[Video description begins] He highlights the LockId value in the output. [Video description ends]

So in order to do that through variables, I'm going to create a variable called $lock.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

So the variable's $lock and it's going to equal the return value of running get-azresourcelock. I'll specify a lock name of lock2 and we know that that applies to a resource group called rg1. But I need the lockid property. Notice I've enclosed that expression within opening and closing parentheses. That's because .lockid will be a property of us retrieving that lock with that statement. Otherwise it'll think we're looking at lockid as being a property of rg1.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: $lock=get-azresourcelock -lockname lock2 -resourcegroupname rg1.lockid. The output reads: Get-AzResourceLock: LockNotFound : The lock 'lock2' could not be found. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Actually, let's see what that would look like in terms of an error if we didn't have those parenthesis there, what would it look like? Okay, well, we're getting some kind of a message about lock2 could not be found. So it's having a problem finding all of this. However, if I bring up the previous command where we did have our open and close parentheses, it didn't give us any complaints.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: $lock=(get-azresourcelock -lockname lock2 -resourcegroupname rg1).lockid. No output displayed and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

And so if we just run $lock to see what's in the variable, looks like it's got the lockid because that's what we asked for, that's the property that's stored in the variable.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: $lock. The output reads: /subscriptions/048b82ac-4519-403b-ab05-6b4305502109/resourceGroups/Rg1/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/locks/Lock2. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Then given that we have that it's at this point that we are able to remove that resource locks. We have a lockid. We can do that with remove-azresourcelock -lockid, and we'll just pass it my variable now $lock. And actually if I don't tell them anything, it asks me for confirmation which I'll Ctrl C to that and then I'll clear the screen and bring up that command again, I'm just going to add -force to suppress it asking me and after a moment looks like it's done.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: remove-azresourcelock -lockid $lock -force. The output reads: True. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

We can verify this with get -azresourcelock.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azresourcelock. No output displayed and the prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Previously it showed us lock2 for rg1, the resource group but now it shows nothing because it's been successfully removed.


Resource Locking and Templates
Not only can you use the CLI PowerShell and the portal to manage resource tags in Azure, but you can also apply tagging from an ARM template. ARM standing for Azure Resource Manager. I've got an example here in WordPad, where essentially what we're looking at here is the type.
This is Microsoft.Authorization/locks. I've got a name here. So I'm going to create a resource lock here, and I'm going to name it Rg3Lock. The level will be ReadOnly, and we can specify any additional notes.
What we don't see in here is the scope to which the resource lock will be applied. That happens at deployment time when the template is deployed.
So let's go ahead and see that. Here in the portal, I'm going to click Create a resource because I want to create a template deployment from my template.
So I'm going to search for template, I'll choose Template deployment.
I'll choose Create, there are a bunch of ways that this could be done, I could have created this template deployment from the CLI or PowerShell.
I've decided I want to do it this way. So I can choose for example, Build your own template in the editor, now we already have it so I can just click Load file.
So I've specified the template file that we looked at a moment ago in WordPad.
So it's going to create a lock called Rg3Lock. It's going to be ReadOnly. So I'm going to go ahead and Save that.
And it automatically pops up into the Custom deployment for that template where we can choose the Resource group where you want that applied.
Let's say Rg3, and I'm going to have to go down and agree to the terms and conditions and I can click Purchase. So now the template deployment has begun. In other words, the lock to resource group Rg3 is in the midst of being applied. Now once it says it's done, which it just did, we're going to go to the resource group and take a look at the locks. So in the Resource group navigation bar, I'm going to click down on Locks and lo and behold there's our lock Rg3 and it's set as Read-only.


Resource Tagging Overview
In Azure, we know that a resource is something that can be deployed in the cloud, whether it's a SQL database or whether it's a virtual machine, a storage account, a network interface, and so on.
Well, we can tag resources and what that really means we're doing is we're adding metadata to them. Now why would you want to do that? You want to add tagging to resources because it allows you to add meaningful additional information to them. Such as related to a department, that that resource might have been deployed by, or a client, that resource should be billed to, or a project it should be billed to, or a cost center.
You can also use policies in Azure to enforce tagging. For example, you could set a policy so that any new resources deployed let's say in a particular resource group will automatically have a cost center tag applied with a specific value. That can be automated. Each resource can have up to a maximum of 50 tags. Now not every single type of Azure resource will support tags, but the vast majority of what you're going to want to do it to, they will support it. The other thing about this is that resource group tags are not inherited. So if you add a tag to a resource group, that does not mean it will automatically flow down and set that tag for all of the resources in the resource group. If you want to do that, look at working with Azure policies that have a modify effect for tagging purposes. You can use the CLI to work with resource tagging.
In our first example, we've got az tag list that's being piped to the line filtering grep tool in UNIX and Linux. And we're asking to display the tagName property.

[Video description begins] The following command is displayed: az tag list | grep "tagName". [Video description ends]

What that will do is give you a list of all of the tags in the entire Azure subscription. You can create a tag with az tag create, here we're naming it DeptID.

[Video description begins] The following command is displayed: az tag create --name DeptID. [Video description ends]

We can also add tag values with az tag add-value.

[Video description begins] The following command is displayed: az tag add-value --name DeptID --value 1234. [Video description ends]

So here we're adding it to DeptID, the value is 1234. You can even apply to a specific resource such as az network vnet update.

[Video description begins] The following command is displayed: az network vnet update -g rg1 -n vnet1 --set tags.DepID=4555. [Video description ends]

So we're applying a tag to a specific VNet in a resource group called rg1. And the name of that is vnet1. And we're using --set tags. and then Dept ID equals in this case the values of 4555. Resource tagging is also possible using PowerShell.

[Video description begins] Azure Resource Tagging - PowerShell. [Video description ends]

In our first example, we're creating a variable called $storaccount. And it's essentially going to point to a storage account. Now we get that by running get-azresource.

[Video description begins] The following command is displayed: $storacct=get-azresource -resourcename storacct3345 -resourcegroupname rg3. [Video description ends]

We specify the name of the resource, in this case, the storage account name and the resource group it's deployed into. So then our variable can be used to refer to that storage account. And in our second example, that's exactly what's being done. We're calling upon our variable. Then we're calling upon .tags and .add, because we want to add the CostCenter tag with the value of YHZ to the storage account.

[Video description begins] The following command is displayed: $storacct.tags.add("CostCenter","YHZ"). [Video description ends]

Then to commit that to the resource to the storage account, we run set-azresource. We use the -tag parameter.
And in this case, we refer to the $storacct variable .tags property. And we use the -resourceid parameter and give the ID, the resource ID of our storage account variable to write to. And I'm using -force here just to suppress any messages that might pop-up asking you for sure here in PowerShell. The next thing I can do is retrieve resources.
Here, I'm using Get-AzResource with the -Tag parameter. And I refer to the tag within curly braces after the @ symbol. So in quotes, I've got CostCenter, it's the name of the tag, equals and then in quotes, I've got the value I'm looking for, YHZ. Now all of that is enclosed within open and close parentheses because if I don't do that, it's going to try to use .Name as a property of YHZ. That's not quite it. We need .Name to be a property of the return result of what executes first within the parentheses, in other words, retrieving the tags. We want to make sure we get the name of the resource. So what that command will really do is it's going to show us the names of all Azure resources in the subscription that have "CostCenter" = "YHZ". So it could potentially be a pretty long listing. In our last example, we can also remove tags.
So in this case, we've already got our storage account pointing to in this case to storage account. Doesn't have to be a storage account, could be pretty much any type of resource that supports tagging. But we're calling upon the variable .tags.remove. And in parentheses and double quotes, I'm just giving it the name of the tag I want to remove, in this case CostCenter.


Resource Tagging and the Portal
Tagging resources in Azure is useful because tags are metadata. It's key and value pairs up to 50 that you could add for each individual Azure resource. You might want to tie a resource to a cost center, or a department, or a project, or something like that. Which facilitates searching, grouping, and even looking at things on a per billing basis for specific tags.
So I'm going to go ahead here and get started in Azure by going to the All resources view where I'm going to open up an existing resource.
It doesn't matter which one it is, let's say I scroll down and open up a virtual machine.

[Video description begins] He clicks a resource name called "WinSrv2019-1" and the corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. [Video description ends]

When you click on an Azure resource, in the navigation panel, you'll see Tags. And when you click Tags, you'll see any existing tags or key and value pairs that have been assigned to that resource. And you can make changes to them up to having 50 key and value pairs.

[Video description begins] He clicks an option called “Tags” and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Currently this virtual machine has two. Project : ABC is the first tag and CostCenter with the value of YHZ is the second one. And I can even add a third one here. So for example, I might tie it to a department. So I'm going to put it Department. Now if I've already created that, as I start typing it'll show up.

[Video description begins] He enters Department in a text box under a column name called "Name". [Video description ends]

However, nothing's popping up so this is a brand new tag I'm creating. And I'm going to set the Value to IT.

[Video description begins] He enters IT in a text box under a column name called "Value". [Video description ends]

So we've now got a third tag that we are adding here to this particular resource. Now we can go back and remove any one of these at any point in time. However, I'm going to click Save. So now that we've got those listed, we see the third one has been added at the bottom. If I were to go to another resource, let's close out of this virtual machine. Let's just pick a storage account and let's look at the tags for it.

[Video description begins] He clicks a resource name called "storacct333325" in the All resources page and the corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

And when I click on Tags, I'll see whatever it's been tagged with already.
And bear in mind, Azure administrators can apply policies that can add default tags. So there might be times when you're creating a resource and you don't add tags. And after you check it, after it's been created, there are tags. That's because of a policy. Anyway, here we can see this storage account has CostCenter : YHZ. If I were to type department, we'll notice it already knows it exists. And in the same way, it knows it's already got a value that's been typed in for another resource. And that's fine, we can go ahead and work with that.
When I click that, it's kind of like a little filter, Now, notice that we've also got a little square icon also over here, and it allows me to show resources with this tag. So let's do it for the first one here, CostCenter : YHZ.
it'll show me resources that have been tagged with that item. So specifically, we can see that all of these items are listed here. And let's just kind of move over a little bit so we can see them all. So they're all listed here as being items that are tagged with that same value. So we can see at the top here, Resources with tag CostCenter : YHZ. Now when you're creating a new resource, for example, let's just get out of here, we're not going to save that. I'm going to click Create a resource.
Let's say we were going to create a brand new storage account. It could be anything but let's say that's what it was.
Now when you're in the midst of creating a new resource in Azure, during the creation, whether in the GUI or at the command line, you can specify tags.
We can see the Tags part of the wizard right here.
And when you go there, it's going to look familiar, you can put in the name and value, up to 50 of them. Okay, so we can do that as well. Let's go back to our All resources view.
Because another aspect of working with tags in the GUI here in the portal, is that you can modify a selection of objects in terms of tagging. What that means is if I were to, let's say, put check marks by a couple of these resources, I can then click the Assign tags button up at the top of the view.
Now within here, I'll see each of the selected items listed and I can delete tags and make changes. But I can also add one up here. So for example, if I wanted to, I could put in a tag, let's call it Stage. And for Value I'm going to put in Testing.
So it's the testing stage that I'm applying to this and I'm going to go ahead and click Save.
So if I look at any one of these items, let's say this storage account, this second one here that was part of our initial selection.
We can also see it says it assigned it to three resources. But let's just check this one anyway. If I go to Tags, I'll see whatever was already applied previous to my last action.
But I will also see that Stage was added with the value of Testing.


Resource Tagging and the CLI
The CLI can prove very handy when it comes to manipulating tags in an Azure environment. 
To get started here, I'm going to type in az tag list. Now when I do that, it should show me details about all of the tags in this entire subscription, but there's too much metadata here.
All I really want to see are the names of tags. So I'm going to clear the screen, I'm going to use the up arrow key to bring up that previous command.
And I'm going to use --query [ ] because it's an array or list of items. And for each of them, we want to see tagName, where Name has a capital N.
That's better. So now I can see the names of tags, not the values that have been applied in my entire subscription. I want to add a new one. So I'm going to run az tag create. And I want to create one, --name, called ClientID. We might want to do this if we want to track resources based on clients, for doing projects for clients, for billing purposes, for chargeback to clients.
So what I've done is created the tag called ClientID.
And we can verify this, of course, if we bring up, using the up arrow key, our az tag list command where we're querying for tagName.
There's ClientID shown at the bottom of the list, perfect. Now I want to add a value for the ClientID tag and then we can apply it to a resource. So to add a value, I'm going to run az tag add-value --name, well, the name of the tag is ClientID and --value. I'm going to set it to a value of 1234.
Now I want to apply that to a resource. So to do that, I'm going to use, let's say, az network vnet update. I'm going to apply this to a VNet, a virtual network, that's deployed in a group, -g, called rg1, resource group 1. -n for the name of the VNet, is Vnet1, and --set tags. in this case ClientID. And of course, I could also specify the value here, 1234, that I want to add to that VNet.
So by adding the value up above, what we're really simply doing is making it available to be assigned to individual resources.
And if we flip over here into the portal where I've pulled up the tags for Vnet1, we indeed will see that ClientID with a value of 1234 has been successfully added.
