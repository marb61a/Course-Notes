Policy Compliance
  - While you can use Azure Policies to limit resource management in the Azure environment
    - You can also use it to check for compliance, such as with security standards.
  - To get started here in the portal, we are going to search for Policy up in the top bar
    - We are going to open up the Policy tool, where the first thing we should do is look at any existing policy assignments.
    - Bear in mind that when you make a policy assignment, such as at the subscription level for that type of scope.
  - Depending on how many objects are in your subscription will determine how long it takes before you can expect compliance reports
    - For example, we've got an assignment here for a policy called Disk encryption should be applied on virtual machines
    - That's been applied at the Pay-As-You-Go subscription level.
  - When we go to the Compliance view, if it's not yet had time to run we have to just wait 
    - And click on Refresh until such time we start getting some information
    - For example, we can see the Disk encryption should be applied on virtual machines compliance report here for the Pay-As-You-Go subscription
    - Currently the Compliance state is Non-compliant, so 0 out of 1
    - It means we have zero out of one applicable item that are compliant with that.
  - If we take a look at that by opening it up, opening up the assignment details
    - Then when we scroll down towards the bottom, we'll see the offender
    - What is the one item that was not compliant?
    - Well, in this case we're talking about disk encryption, which applies to a virtual machine, shows us the name of the virtual machine
    - We can see the Compliance state for it is that it's Non-compliant.
    - If we click on the Details link for that, we'll get a bit more insight as to what's going on.
    - Here it says, No related resources match the effect details in the policy definition. In this case, looking for encrypted disks.
  - By viewing these compliance reports, we can determine whether certain machines are compliant with security standards such as this one
    - If not, we know where to focus our energy to bring those devices into compliance.


Policy Remediation
  - You can configure remediation tasks for certain types of Azure Policies when it comes to non-compliant resources.
    - An example of this would be a custom policy that uses the modify policy effect, take a look at this here in the portal
    - We are going to start by going to the Azure Policy tool.
  - We'll first start by looking at an existing definition for a custom built policy.
    - We are going to change the Type drop-down list here on the right to Custom, there it is
    - Add Cost Center Tag, going to click to open up that custom policy definition, and let's take a look at the definition down below.
  - What's happening is we're looking for a tag in resources called CostCenter.
    - Depending on where we assign this policy will determine what it's going to look at.
  - Is it going to look at all resources in the subscription or just certain ones in a resource group? 
    - Depends on where this custom policy is assigned at which scope level
    - So if there is not a CostCenter tag, so if that works out to be false, what should we do?
    - Well, we want to add a CostCenter tag with an appropriate value. So then the effect is modify. 
    - What we want to do is make sure that we add a specific tag, in this case the CostCenter tag, with the value of YHZ.
  - This will certainly apply to newly created resources, they will automatically have this tag added
    - But for existing ones, we'd have to check the compliance. So let's see what that looks like. 
  - Close out of here, and let's go back to our Compliance view over here on the left
    - Where we can see our Add Cost Center Tag has been applied to the Pay-As-You-Go or subscription scope.
  - We can see that currently the state is Non-compliant, 0 out of 34 resources are compliant with that
    - If we click on that, we'll be able to see the resources in question
    - In this case, it's going to be any resource that does not have that tag value.
  - CostCenter with a value of YHZ, we can scroll down and we can see the identity of those specific resources
    - For example, the first one is a virtual machine called winsrv2019-1
    - Over on the far right, click the three dots button, we can select the Compliance reason to see why it's not compliant.
    - It's not compliant because the CostCenter tag doesn't even have a value, so there's nothing there. It needs to have a value of YHZ. 
    - What we can do is create a remediation task by clicking that button of the same name up here at the top. 
  - When you create a remediation task, you are remediating in alignment with what that policy says should exist
    - In this case, that's the Add Cost Center Tag policy that wants the CostCenter tag with the value of YHZ to be applied
    - So we have a list of the resources here in our subscription that really need to be remediated and have that item added, that tag
    - We are going to go ahead and click the Remediate button at the bottom. And we can see a remediation task has successfully been created.
  - It shows it here, when we're looking at our Policy compliance, we can see under the Remediation tasks tab that it's currently In Progress
    - So back here in our Compliance view, if we click Refresh, we can see that for our Add Cost Center Tag custom policy, the non-compliant state is changing.
    - It will take a bit of time, we can keep on clicking the Refresh button. But now we've got 86% resource compliance. 
    - Click to open that up, let's go back and take a peek at the status of our remediation task, go to the Remediation tasks, we can see its Complete.
    - If we clicked on it, then we'll be able to see some further detail.
  - Just because it's complete, it doesn't mean that every resource in the subscription has been modified to be compliant
    - It means that it's complete in that the instructions have been sent, it just might not completely be done
    - So here we can see the resources against which that modify effect for adding that tag value has succeeded
    - So for example, for vnet1, a virtual network, let's take a look at that
    - If we actually click to open up that resource, did it or did it not automatically tag it?
    - We will take a look so we are going to go Tags
    - If there were any tags here already, we'll see those in addition to the new one
    - We apparently had a tag here called Project with the value of ABC
    - Now we can see CostCenter: YHZ has been added. And this is a result of having created a remediation task.

                    
Azure AD Role Overview
  - In Azure Role-Based Access Control, otherwise called RBAC is a way to delegate permissions to others to manage Azure resources.  
    - There are a number of built in roles that you can select from or you can define your own custom roles if they don't suit your needs
    - Some examples of built in roles include the owner role.
  - If you have the owner role, you have full resource management control of all resources in Azure
    - We haven't yet talked about the scope of where that applies, but unto itself that's what it means
    - Think of an RBAC role as being a collection of related permissions
    - You've got the contributor role. So resource control, other than changing RBAC access
    - Reader role, which implies read-only access. Other examples would include CDN endpoint reader for Content Delivery Network endpoint reader
    - You can read endpoints, but that's it, can you configure them?
    - Cost Management contributors you can read and write Azure cost configurations 
    - Including working with budgets, virtual machine administrator login as it implies
    - You can read VMs in the portal and login with admin credentials.
  - There are many more built in roles than that, that's just to give us a sampling of what we might expect
    - But you can also work with custom roles, maybe you need one role that combines virtual machine and cost management permissions for example
    - What you would do is create a custom JSON role file, this is just a text file that uses JSON syntax
    - You have to know what that syntax is to properly define the role, and then you can create the role from that file
    - For example in PowerShell, you can do that with the New-AzRoleDefinition cmdlet, or in the CLI you might use AZ role definition create.
  - Working with a custom RBAC role file uses JSON syntax, you could even type this into your favorite text editor, it doesn't matter
    - Notice we've got the opening and closing curly braces at the very top and the very bottom
    - The first item we see defined here is the "Name": custom VM roles It's got its own ID, the IsCustom flag third line down is set to true
    - We have a Description, and then we have a collection of actions
    - What are the permissions grouped together here within this role?
    - So it looks like we have a bunch of read access to all items indicated with the asterisk in storage, network and compute
    - And then the ability to start and restart virtual machines, this is what we would see within a custom RBAC role definition file.
