Azure AD Users and PowerShell (Cont)
  - If we just do $pw to see what's in that variable, it doesn't even return the actual password
    - That's the point, it's been converted to a secure string item, and we can pass that, to the new-azaduser cmdlet.
  - We are going to set -displayname, let's say here -displayname to a user Sharon Bishop
    - Creating Sharon Bishop the -userprincipalname will be determined by well first of all 
    - It's going to be determined by organizational naming conventions but in this case 
    - It's going to be sbishop@ and then the DNS name of our Azure AD tenant
    - And we'll just close the double quotes after that and specify -password, this is where we're going to pass it our variable
    - So $pw, which we know from above is a secure string representation of the password we specified up above.
    - It requires the MailNickname parameters, because we did not supply it, it asks for it, cancel this for a moment
  - We'll clear the screen, if we were to use the up arrow key to bring up the new-azaduser cmdlet, we could add the -MailNickname parameter
    - So -mailnickname, for example say it's just going to be sbishop
    - If we press Enter, it creates the account and doesn't ask us anything
    - That's going to be an important thing to consider mandatory parameter values when it comes to trying to automate some of these things.
  - Just check our work, first of all here, directly in the portal since we have it opened up, go to the users view of our Azure AD tenant
    - And indeed we can see Sharon Bishop has been created.
  - Let's go back into PowerShell for a second, because there are some cmdlets that we can use
    - For example, get-azaduser to check to see what's in our Azure AD tenant.
  - We can see the last user here, of course, is user Sharon Bishop
    - Of course in PowerShell, we can start filtering out what we want to see
    - For example, get-azaduser, we can pipe the result of a PowerShell command using the pipe symbol, the vertical bar symbol
    - Most keyboards you can get that symbol by shifting your backslash key
    - We can then refer to select and tell it what we want to see
    - Let's say we want to see the display name property, you have to know what the properties are called comma, and the id.
  - There's the display name and there's the internal Id identifier for the Azure AD user accounts
    - We have the option then of using a number of PowerShell cmdlets for managing Azure AD users, and we can take that a step further
    - Clear the screen, remember how we ran get-command, we are going to use wildcards here and going to put azaduser. We used New-AzADUser and Get-AzADUser.
  - If you want to make modifications to a user account, you could use Set-AzADUser
    - You could also remove accounts also using Remove-AzADUser, there are a lot of options that are available
    - For example, let's say we wanted to change Sharon Bishop's last name, we could use update -azaduser and specify the -objectId
    - Wee're going to have to go back to a previous command to see what Sharon Bishop's ID is
    - We are going to go ahead and copy that to my clipboard, let's clear the screen here and let's try this, run update-azaduser-objectid.
  - He we'll just right-click and paste Sharon Bishop's ID, say we want to change the display names, so -displayname
    - Now we want it to be Sharon and for lack of a better choice, just so we can illustrate the example, her last name will now say changed
    - So Sharon Changed and if we do that looks like, it took let's kind of use our up arrow key to go back to get-azaduser
    - And indeed we can see Sharon's last name is now changed.

                    
Azure Guest Users
  - User accounts in Azure AD provide accountability. Everyone would have their own account that they would use to sign in, to access cloud based apps
    - Or in some cases even on-premises based apps. But sometimes the users that you want to participate in that kind of
    - Functionality already have an account with an external provider, now talk about how to add guest user in Azure AD.
    - Here on the portal, we are going to navigate to Azure Active Directory and then into the Users view.
  - We are going to go ahead and click the New guest user button, up at the top of the All users view
    - Although, technically, if we were just to click New user
    - The first part of the wizard is whether you want to create the user directly in Azure AD
    - Or you want to invite them, inviting is the same as just clicking the guest user button, it doesn't make a difference.
  - Go back to the All users view, we are going to click the New guest user button up at the top.
    - The first thing we have to do is fill in some details, who is this user? 
    - We are just going to call this user Fake External user and specify an email address for an account
    - We now have a sample account that we can use here. It's a Hotmail account
    - We going to go ahead and specify that information, just put some information in here for the first and last names.
  - We can also personalize the message. Welcome! You can join us to access APP1
    - We did just as an example and we could also specify the group and role affiliation for this account
    - The roles will be important when it comes to permissions that might be required by that account
    - We don't want to block the sign in or anything like that, we are not going to fill in job information
    - We are just going to click Invite, it's inviting the users, the next thing to do is to check that person's mail account.
    - In that users inbox, I'm going to have a Microsoft Invitation messages that says, You're invited to the QUICK24X7 organization.
  - How nice is that? And there's my personalized message. Welcome! You can join us to access APP1
    - The user can click the Get Started button. This is what the user will then see, so review the permissions here
    - We are going to accept all of this, we'll click Accept
    - It automatically takes that user to Access Panel Applications that might have been made available for this user to access
    - In the QUICK24X7 Azure Active Directory tenant
    - Of course, there are no applications configured, but the user is successfully signed in.
  - Back in the Azure portal, when we take a look at our list of users in our Azure AD tenant, we can see our Fake External User
    - Notice the icon is a little bit different because they aren't actually a part of Azure Active Directory.
  - Here we can see, we have a user that just says Microsoft Account. That's the original accounts that signed up for Azure.
    - Then we've got a couple of users created in Azure Active Directory. And then we've got our User type of Guest. 
    - If you're a PowerShell person, we are just going to launch Cloud Shell up here in the portal, you might also run connect-azuread.
  - Then from there, you might run a command like to review guest users, just make sure it took
    - So get-azureaduser -filter, we are going to put in quotes usertype eq and single quotes Guest, that's what we re looking for
    - We'll spell that correctly, close the single quote, close the double quote and press Enter. 
    - Indeed, we can see that our Fake External User is the only account that shows up here.


Azure Bulk User Create
  - When you have multiple Azure AD user accounts that you need to create, you could create them one at a time, such as in the GUI, but there's a better way.
    - You could of course also write a script in PowerShell or in the CLI, but we're going to use the bulk create option
    - To get started in the portal, we are going to navigate to Azure Active Directory and specifically go to the Users view.
  - We are going to see any existing users but we've got a Bulk create button at the top
    - Now that's used when you want to essentially import a number of Azure AD or Azure Active Directory users
    - Whereas Bulk invite is for external users that you want to invite to participate
    - We are going to choose Bulk create, we can then Download a CSV template
    - The example has already done this and edited it and been populated which is what we take a look at
  - We are using Microsoft Excel where we've added the required information but you need to make sure you save it as a CSV file
    - Here it says some of your features in your workbook might not be available
    - That's okay, it needs to be CSV. So yes, we want to use that format
    - What you get in this template when you download it is the version number at the top and then all of these column headers
    - You need to leave that stuff in there, some of these column headers have an asterisk
    - That means that it's required information. So things like First name, Last name, Job title, Department
    - That stuff isn't required to create the account in Azure AD
    - But the Name, the User name, and also the Initial password and whether the account is enabled, that is needed
    - For the example we've got that stored in a file, called Azure_BulkUserCreate_Users
    - Bring that into Azure AD. Now what you're looking for here is it to say, File uploaded successfully.
  - If there's a problem, maybe you deleted the header row from the file 
    - Or perhaps you didn't specify something that's required as denoted with the asterisk, you'll see it here listed in red
    - At this point, we are going to click Submit, we can see currently, it's in progress
    - Naturally, it might take a while if you have a lot of users that you're creating all at the same time
    - You can also, as it says, click to view the status of each operation
    - When you do that, it takes us to the Bulk operations results, part of our Azure AD tenant, here it says it's Completed with no errors
  - We have our message up here that popped up in the upper right, in the notification area that tells us the same type of thing
    - Go to the All users view to see if our two new users exist. And they do, there's Lucas Brenner and there's Marcia Lin.
