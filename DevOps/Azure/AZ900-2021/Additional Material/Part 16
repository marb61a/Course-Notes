Azure Cost Analysis
One important aspect of cloud computing is being able to manage costs, even though it's often pay-as-you-go, you get charged for your resource consumption. You want to make sure that you are tracking it and identifying where most of those charges are coming from. So we can do that by looking at Azure cost analysis.
To get started here in the portal, I'm going to go into Subscriptions, because billing occurs at the subscription level.
So I've got a Pay-As-You-Go subscription listed here, I can see the Current cost, and I can see that it's Active.

[Video description begins] He points to the following row entry, which includes: Subscription name: Pay-As-You-Go, Current cost: CA$1.48, and Status: Active. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click directly on the subscription.
Because when I do that, I get this new navigation bar on the left, and one of the things I see is Cost analysis, which is precisely what I want to do right now.
Knowing that I have a specific dollar amount based on my Azure usage is not enough. I want to know how it's broken down. So here for example, we can see it's Canadian dollars. It's only $1 and 48 cents. And we can see that it's charted here. I'll just scroll little bit over to the right according to days of the month as we can see, and it looks like the usage has been increasing since about March 4th. Now, if I scroll down a little bit, we can also see the Service name breakdown. Well, where is that money being spent? Is it virtual machines? Is it storage? Is it databases? Well, we can see by looking under Service name at this graph, that we've got the bulk of it coming from SQL database.
Little bit coming from virtual machines and storage. And we can also then see it's broken down here by Location, well, which regions. We might have different Azure administrators using our Azure account to deploy resources in different Azure regions. So I can see the cost here per region that looks like all of the cost is stemming from the US East region. Now, depending on how you use resource groups to organize related Azure resources it will determine how useful it is to look at the cost per resource group.
Often many organizations will create resource groups for specific apps that might have multiple components like a web server type of app. And it might have some custom code. It might have a back-end database. All of those resources might be organised in one resource group and then you can see the charges per resource group. So basically, in that example, you'd be able to see the charges per web application. Or you might have resource groups for different departments, if that make sense in your organization or different projects, and then deploy resources into them accordingly. And again, you'll then be able to see the cost breakdown per resource group. It really depends on what your requirements are. And you can also click the Export button to export this information as a PNG type of graphic file or as Excel data or as a CSV file.
And then you can download the charts. You can also schedule the export of this information on a periodic basis maybe to a storage account for business analysts that might require this type of cost breakdown.
Now, we can also get a little more granular at the top by clicking Cost by resource.
Now, why is this useful? Because it's showing us the individual Azure resources, like specific SQL servers that were deployed specific virtual machines, disks for virtual machines, storage accounts, and so on.
And we have a cost associated with it over in the right hand column.
So it's just a way to really drill right down to the specific deployed resources that are incurring costs in your Azure account through your subscription.


Azure Budgets
While it's important to analyze costs and pore over the numbers, it's also equally important to save time and get notified when costs on a monthly basis exceed a certain value. And that's where Azure budgets come in as being useful.
So I'm going to click here in the portal on Subscriptions. I see, I have a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, which I'm going to click on.
Now we know that we can click on Cost analysis, and of course, that is very important.
But we're talking here about getting notified when a certain threshold value is exceeded. So for that, we're going to go to Budgets over here on the left.
Now we don't have any budget shown on the right.
So I'm going to go ahead and click Add. The first thing you have to think about is the scope to which you want the budget applied. What do you want to look at costs for, do you want to look at it for your entire subscription?
I can click Change scope and from here, I could switch to a different directory.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Select scope" opens. It includes a button labeled "Cancel" and a list of items. The list contains the following node: Quick24x7 (root). [Video description ends]

Right now, I'm using the Quick24x7 Azure AD tenant. And we could also drill down, for example, under our root management group for our tenant. So I can click that.

[Video description begins] He clicks the node "Quick24x7 (root)" and a subnode called "MgmtGroup1" appears. [Video description ends]

I can then click down on a management group, perhaps that's the level where I want to apply my budget.

[Video description begins] He clicks the subnode "MgmtGroup1" and a subnode called "Pay-As-You-Go" appears. [Video description ends]

But I can also click on the management group and then go down under my subscription, and even go down into a specific resource group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the subnode "Pay-As-You-Go" and several subnodes appear. [Video description ends]

So you have all of these scopes that you can apply your budget to. I'm just going to Cancel out of there. We're going to leave it directly on our Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

[Video description begins] Two drop-down list boxes appear adjacent to the "Add filter" button. [Video description ends]

I could also click Add filter, because maybe what I want to do is filter by something specific. So for example, I could specify that I want to look at a type of service I want to filter on. Or maybe a ResourceLocation, so we can choose a specific region if we wanted to filter on that.

[Video description begins] In the first drop-down list box he selects the "ResourceLocation" option. [Video description ends]

However, I'm going to click the x to remove the filter, I don't want to apply that.

[Video description begins] He removes the filters. [Video description ends]

Next thing I need to do here is, I need to specify a unique name for the budget.

[Video description begins] The "Create budget" page also includes a section called "BUDGET DETAILS". This section includes a text box labeled "Name", a drop-down list box labeled "Reset period", and another text box labeled "Amount ($)". [Video description ends]

So I'm going to call this Budget1.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the "name" text box: Budget1. [Video description ends]

Now the Reset period will be on a monthly basis, but I could change that to whatever time period makes the most sense for me. I could set an Expiration date.

[Video description begins] The following option is preselected in the "Reset period" drop-down list box: Billing month. [Video description ends]

I'm going to leave those default settings, and I'm going to set the budget amount. For example, I want to know once we're exceeding $500 a month. Now to help along with this, down below, I can see last month's costs. And I can see the past six months' cost, and the maximum monthly forecast cost. So based on those small values, perhaps 500 is a little large. So maybe for example, if we get above a 100, which might be indicative of abnormal cloud usage in our particular case, then we can put that value in.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the "Amount ($)" text box: 100. [Video description ends]

Now having done that, I'm going to scroll down and click on the Next> button. Now up at the top, if I scroll back up, we can set alerts.

[Video description begins] A page called "Set alerts" opens. It includes a table with several columns and one row entry. The column headers include "% of budget" and "Action group". Under the "% of budget" column header the row entry is a text box. Under the "Action group" column header the row entry is a drop-down list box. Under the table there is a link called "Manage action group". [Video description ends]

So when we get to a percentage of that value, let's see when we get to 80% of our $100, then we want to have something happen.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the row entry under the "% of budget" column header: 80. [Video description ends]

So we can work with an Action group. Now the Action group allows me to specify things like, what you want to occur. Now, do you want to trigger some kind of code, or do you want to trigger some kind of a notification? And I even have a Manage action group option here. If I click on that, it'll take me in where I can see what I could do, what could be triggered when 80% of our budget is reached.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Manage actions" opens. It includes a button labeled "Add action group" and a table with several columns and one row. The column headers include "Action group name" and "Short name". [Video description ends]

So I could click Add action group, maybe what I want to do send something like an SMS text message.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Add action group" opens. It includes two text boxes labeled "Action group name" and "Short name" and a button labeled "OK". [Video description ends]

So I'm going to call this AG1 for action group 1. Same thing for the Short name, which is a required field, as indicated by the red asterisk.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the "Action group name" and "Short name" text boxes: AG1. [Video description ends]

And down below, what I want to do is Select an action type.

[Video description begins] The blade also includes a table with several columns and one row. The column headers include "Action name" and "Action type". The row entry in the "Action name" column is a text box. The row entry in the "Action type" column is a drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

In this case, it's going to be Email/SMS/Push/Voice.

[Video description begins] He selects the following option in the drop-down list box in the "Action type" column: Email/SMS/Push/Voice. A blade called "Email/SMS/Push/Voice" opens. It includes an "OK" button and a radio button labeled "SMS". He selects the radio button and the following text boxes get enabled: Country code and Phone number. [Video description ends]

And let's say that I want to send SMS text notifications. So it's country code, and I could just fill in the number. After I've done that, I would then go down and click OK. Now, of course, it wants me to fill in a valid phone number. So we'll just change it into something else. All 5s in a phone number is actually reserved and used for works of fiction like movies and television shows. So I'm just going to go ahead and leave that as it is for SMS. So we're just basically adding this specific type of notification. And I'm just going to call this TextMsgNotify. This is in my action group AG1, and I'll click OK.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the text box in the "Action name" column: TextMsgNotify. [Video description ends]

And essentially, we want to be able to use that within our budget.

[Video description begins] The table on the "Manage actions" blade now has two row entries. [Video description ends]

So it's showing up in the list. I'm just going to go ahead and select it to get back to where we were in configuring our notifications.

[Video description begins] He clicks the new row entry, which includes: Action group name: AG1. A blade called "AG1" opens. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to scroll back here, we've got AG1, and let's just go back here. So that's where we want this to be showing up.

[Video description begins] He navigates back to the "Set alerts" page in the "Pay-As-You-Go" blade. He points to the drop-down list box in the "Action group" column of the table. He then selects the "AG1" option in the drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

And after a moment, you might have to go to the previous screen and back, you'll see the group. So here it is, AG1. Down below, I can also specify, of course, the recipients' email. So I'm just going to scroll over to the right so I can see my scroll bar, there it is.
So maybe, I've got a group called admins@quick24x7.com, and I want them to receive notifications, so in addition to our SMS text messaging. Okay, so having done that, I'm just good to go down and create the budget.
And there you have it, the budget creation succeeded, we now have our budget called Budget1.
And we can expect to be notified when we get to 80% of our budgeted value in the currency specified for the subscription, in this case, CA$100.00.


Azure Invoices
While the use of cloud computing can mean less capital expenditures for IT services. Such as, not having to acquire a lot of on-premises physical computing hardware. We still have to be able to track charges in the cost on a per-use basis by reviewing invoices.
So to get started here in the Azure portal, I'm going to click on Subscriptions.
Now, the subscription of course is tied to an Azure AD tenant which is shown here as being Quick24x7. My subscription is called Pay-As-You-Go. I'm going to go ahead and click on it to open up this navigation bar which gives me options related to my subscription.
One of which, if I scroll down under Billing, is Invoices.
Now, we can see on the right that we have the Last 3 months worth of invoices shown. We can see the Billing Periods, starting and ending. We can see the date of the invoice. And we can also see the Amount. And we can see the Type, in this case it's for Azure Services. Now we also, if we scroll to the right, have the option of downloading each of these. Now, if I click on the download link, it's a CSV file format download or it could be a PDF.

[Video description begins] He clicks the download link of the third row entry and its corresponding blade opens. [Video description ends]

Now, this could be important for accounting reasons and certainly for business expense or taxation reasons. So this is something that we can do by looking at the invoices. But notice also that each of these specific dollar amounts for each invoice is a hyperlink, it's blue.

[Video description begins] He points to the row entries in the "Amount" column. [Video description ends]

And so, if I were to click directly on it, I could actually jump into the Cost analysis for that particular invoice.

[Video description begins] He clicks the third row entry in the "Amount" column and a blade called "Cost analysis" opens. It includes a table with several columns and several rows. The column headers include "Service name", "Service tier", and "Cost". The blade also includes a date drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

So I can see for example, looks like premium solid state drive or ssd managed disks. Were really the bulk of the cost for that particular invoice within that time frame.

[Video description begins] He points to the first row entry in the table. [Video description ends]

Followed by, it looks like, virtual machines. So we can see how this breaks down. We can even filter it.

[Video description begins] He points to the second row entry in the table. [Video description ends]

If I want to click on Filter items, we could start typing things in and then filtering based on that.

[Video description begins] He points to a text box labeled "Filter items". [Video description ends]

So for example, if I put in ssd, all we're doing now is looking at SSD charges related to the time frame listed up above.

[Video description begins] He types "ssd" in the "Filter items" text box and the row entries in the table get filtered. [Video description ends]

So I'm just going to go ahead and click the X to close out of that. Now, it's one thing to come here and view the invoices. But we want to try to avoid having to do things in the sense of thinking of doing it. We want to automate things. And we can click the Email Invoice option up at the top.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Email invoice" opens. It includes a button labeled "Opt In". [Video description ends]

Currently it says, You are not receiving emailed invoices. Well, that's something I want to do. So I'm going to click on Opt In to make that happen.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Email statement notice" opens. It includes a button labeled "Agree". [Video description ends]

I acknowledge that it's going to be sent via non-encrypted email. That's fine, I Agree.

[Video description begins] The following pop-up box appears: Opt-in Complete. He closes the "Email invoice" blade. [Video description ends]

So this could be an important aspect of your configuration when it comes to having your invoices emailed to you automatically. The other thing to think about is we have this Access Invoice button up at the top. Now, this is currently On.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Access to invoice" opens. [Video description ends]

 And it would apply for example to users in your subscription that would have roles such as the the billing reader role. So we have that option available as well.

[Video description begins] He closes the "Access to invoice" blade. [Video description ends]

Also notice that the default here, Timespan is listed as being 3 months. But you can click on that and change it.
So for example, I can set it to the Last year if that's what I want to see.
And sure enough, we now see our invoices for the Last year.


Azure Resource Groups and the Portal
In Microsoft Azure, a resource group is a way to organize related resources together, such as creating a resource group for a web application and deploying all of the underlying resources that make that web app work within the resource group. Or maybe creating a resource group for a department. And when that department in the organization deploys resources, they deploy them into that resource group, or you might do it for a project. Either way, it allows us to track billing for resources in that resource group. It also allows us to track usage of items or see deployments within that resource group.
So here in the portal, let's get started by creating a resource group, we're going to do that by beginning within the Resource groups view. So in the upper left, I'll open up the navigator and I'll click Resource groups.
And you're going to see any existing resource groups, you'll see any subscriptions that they may be tied to, and their geographical location.
Now, if you click on a specific resource group and open up its properties blade, you'll be able to see things like Tags, you could tag it.
You can also see any deployments that were made into that resource group and the state of them, whether they succeeded or whether they failed. 
You can also even see Cost analysis and Cost alerts and Budgets per resource group, so at the resource group level.
However, in this case, we're going to create a new resource group, so back here at my main Azure portal page, I'll click Create a resource.
Now from here, I'm just going to search for resource group, and there it is, Resource group. So, I'm going to go ahead and click the Create button, and then I have to fill in a few little details.
Basically I have to give it a name and specify the region where I want to create it.
And, of course, tie it to a particular Subscription, of which I have only one, the Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

[Video description begins] He selects the "Pay-As-You-Go" option in the "Subscription" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

I'm going to call this Rg2, Resource group 2, and it's going to be, let's see, in a different location, I'm going to put this one in Canada Central.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the "Resource group" text box: Rg2. [Video description ends]

I'm doing that because I know that most of my resources will be deployed in that same type of region.

[Video description begins] He selects the "(Canada) Canada Central" option in the "Region" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

Then I'll click next for tags.

[Video description begins] The "Tags" step gets selected in the first section and its corresponding page opens in the second section. It includes a table with three columns and one row and a button labeled "Next : Review + create >". The column headers include Name and Value. The row entries under both these column headers are text boxes. [Video description ends]

Now we could specify a tag key and value pair. For example, if this is going to be tied to a project, we can specify a Project and a Value, let's say project ABC.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the row entry in the "Name" column: Project. He types the following text in the row entry in the "Value" column: ABC. [Video description ends]

 But bear in mind, depending on how you plan on using this, you might just name the resource group project ABC, so really depends how you want to use it.

[Video description begins] The "Review + create" step gets selected in the first section and its corresponding page opens in the second section. It includes a button labeled "Create". [Video description ends]

At any rate, I'm going to click the next button, validation is passed, I'm going to click Create, and after a moment it will create our resource group.

[Video description begins] The following pop-up box appears: Resource group created. It includes a button labeled "Go to resource group". [Video description ends]

I'm going to click the Go to resource group link.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Rg2" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Well, actually, before we do that, let's go back to the Resource groups view, just to shows up there.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the "Resource groups" blade. [Video description ends]

We know it will, so we just have to, click Refresh, maybe a few times, and wait a moment and then we'll see resource group show up, resource group 2, Rg2 show up.

[Video description begins] A new row entry for Rg2 gets added to the table. He clicks this row entry and the "Rg2" blade opens again. [Video description ends]

We can click on it and then start to explore it.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Deployments" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and no rows. [Video description ends]

Now, of course, it's not really being used at this point, you could go under Deployments and you would see that there's no deployments that have been sent here because it's newly created. But when you deploy new resources, for example, if I were to go, let's say to the All resources view, not that we have to do it this way, but we can.

[Video description begins] He opens the navigator and selects an option called "All resources". The "All resources" blade opens. It includes a button labeled "Add". [Video description ends]

And, if I were to click the Add button, let's say we want to add a virtual machine, Windows Server 2016 Datacenter.

[Video description begins] A blade called "New" opens. He selects an option called "Windows Server 2016 Datacenter". A blade called "Create a virtual machine" opens. It includes a "Resource group" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

Part of that deployment is going to be specifying the resource group into which we want to deploy it. So, I can see I've got a drop-down list here for resource groups, and I could specify the Resource group, in this case, Rg2, where I want this resource deployed.


Azure Resource Groups and the CLI
In this demonstration, I'm going to use the Azure CLI to manage Azure resource groups.
But first, here in the portal, I've navigated to the Resource groups view where I can see, I currently have two resource groups.

[Video description begins] He clicks the second row entry, which includes: Name: Rg1. A blade called "Rg1" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. He selects an option called "Deployments" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and two rows. The column headers include "Deployment name" and "Status". [Video description ends]

And if I click on any one of them to open them up, I could click on Deployments to open up that blade to see any items that were deployed into that resource group. Whether it Succeeded or whether it failed.

[Video description begins] He points to the "Status" column. [Video description ends]

And I can even perform a Cost analysis against the resource deployments inside of this resource group and so on.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Cost analysis" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So let's go to the CLI and let's start managing resource groups. The first thing I'll do is run az group -h.

[Video description begins] He opens the command prompt window. The following prompt is displayed: D: \>. [Video description ends]

Now on help, I'm working with resource groups.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az group -h. The output displays a list of groups, subgroups, and commands. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

And it does say here that this allows me to Manage resource groups and template deployments. Perfect. So the next thing I'm going to do is get the next level command, which in this case to create a resource group would be create, so az group create. Now, if I need more help, I can run az group create -h to learn more about any parameters that I might need to pass on the command line to work with this. So such as --location or -l to specify the location or the region.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. He executes the following command: az group create -h. The output displays a list of arguments and global arguments. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

And it even says, if you want to know how to type in those items, you could see the values by typing in az account list-locations. Of course, we'll have to specify the name and so on. So I'm going to go ahead and clear the screen with cls and I'm going to do this. I'm going to run az group create -l for location, in my case canadaeast. And I'm going to call this resource group -n Rg2.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az group create -l canadaeast -n Rg2. The output displays that the provisioning succeeded. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Now after I've done that, I should get some returned JSON output which is indicative of the fact the provisioning succeeded, which it says it did. So I'm going to go ahead and run az group to list my resource groups.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az group list. The output displays a list of resource groups and their properties. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

However, it lists all of the properties and it's a little hard to digest that output. So what I could do is run az group list, I could pipe it to the grep line filtering tool. And I could tell it I'm looking for the name property.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. He executes the following command: az group list | grep name. The output reads: 'grep' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

But here it says 'grep' is not recognized. Well, that's because I'm running the Azure CLI locally on my Windows machine as opposed to within a Cloud Shell. This is not a Linux host. I don't have the Linux subsystem for Windows installed, there's no way to grep this. So what I could do is also pipe that instead to the Windows find command. Now, in this case I'd have to specify that the name be within quotations in order for that to work correctly.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az group list | find "name". The output displays the names of 3 resource groups. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

And once I do that, it will show me just the names of the accounts. Now the next thing I could do also is use the az group list, I could use the --query parameter. This is built into the Azure CLI, it's probably the best way to do it. And because we have an array of items, in this case, we have three resource groups, we have to refer to the fact that we have more than one. And I can specify that we have an array or a collection of them by specifying open and close square brackets. Then I separate that reference from the property, in this case, name with a dot so .name. And now we'll see just the names of those specific resource groups.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az group list --query [].name. The output displays the names of 3 resource groups within square brackets. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Now the thing is though, you can also delete a resource group. For example, here I'm going to run az group delete, and in this case, -n for name. Let's delete our first one, resource group 1, Rg1. But let's go back and check it out in the portal before we actually press Enter.

[Video description begins] He switches back to the Microsoft Azure portal. [Video description ends]

So back here in the portal, I want to go Home and I'm going to go to the All resources view. And I see that I've got two storage account here deployed in the Rg1 Resource group.

[Video description begins] He opens the "All resources" blade. It includes a table with several columns and three rows. He points to the second and third row entries. [Video description ends]

Okay, so they still exist. Now I could have seen that of course by going into Rg1, the Resource group, and then going into Deployments. I would see that those two storage accounts had successfully been deployed here. All right, having that in mind, let's go back to the CLI.

[Video description begins] He switches back to the command prompt window. [Video description ends]

And I'm going to press Enter to delete resource group 1 or Rg1, are you sure you want to do it?

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az group delete -n Rg1. The screen prompts to confirm if you want to perform this operation. [Video description ends]

Yes, put in the letter y, and I'll press Enter, and it says it's Running. Now even while that's in the midst of running here back here in the portal, I've refreshed my All resources view. And notice that our two storage accounts have been removed.

[Video description begins] He switches back to the Microsoft Azure portal. The table on the "All resources" blade now has only one row entry. [Video description ends]

So the message here is clear, when you delete a resource group, you're also removing all of the resources deployed into it.

Azure Resource Groups and PowerShell

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure Resource Groups and PowerShell. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In this demonstration, I'm going to use PowerShell to create an Azure resource group.

[Video description begins] The PowerShell window is open. The following prompt is displayed: PS /home/danlachance72>. [Video description ends]

So to get started here, I'm going to run get-command in my Cloud Shell, and I'm going to use an * followed by the text resourcegroup. And then after that, I'm going to put in another *. So in other words, showing PowerShell cmdlets that contain the text resource group in their name. And we can see that we have quite a few of them.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-command *resourcegroup*. The output displays a list of cmdlets that contain 'resource group' in their name. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

I'm interested in building a new one, and I can see we have the New-AzureRmResourceGroup PowerShell cmdlet, so I'm going to go ahead and use that. And, I am going to clear the screen, I'm going to run new-azurermresourcegroup. I'm going to specify the name. In this case, I want to build a resource group called Rg2, resource group 2. And I'm going to set the location with -location in this case to the canada east region. So I'm going to use the new-azurermresourcegroup cmdlet -name. I want to call this Rg1 for resource group 1, and -location, I'm going to set in quotes to canada east. I'm using quotes because there's a space between canada and east within that region name, and I'll press Enter.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: new-azurermresourcegroup -name Rg1 -location "canada east". The output displays that the provisioning has succeeded. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

After a moment we can see the ProvisioningState of having created resource group one or Rg1, is that it Succeeded. We can verify this by retrieving information get-azurermresourcegroup. When we do that it returns our resource groups including the one that we just created, Rg1.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azurermresourcegroup. The output displays the three resource groups and information about them. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Notice the property tied to that is ResourceGroupName at least as it's labeled here. So I'm going to clear the screen, we're going to use the up arrow key to bring up our get command line. I'm going to pipe this to select and we are going to tell we want to select only the resourcegroupname property. So then all we are seeing are the names of our specific resource groups.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get-azurermresourcegroup | select resourcegroupname. The output displays three resource group names. The prompt does not change. [Video description ends]

Now we also have the option of removing a resource group. But before we do that, why don't we minimize our Cloud Shell here in the portal, and let's go to the Resource groups view where we will see any resource groups, there are three here.

[Video description begins] He switches to the Microsoft Azure portal. He opens the "Resource groups" blade. It includes a table with several columns and three rows. He points to the second and third row entries. [Video description ends]

Including Rg1 and Rg2. So what I want to do is issue a command to delete Rg2 using PowerShell. So back in our command shell, we're going to go ahead and do that by using the remove-azurermresourcegroup cmdlet. And I'm going to tell it the name in this case is going to be Rg2. It says are you sure you want to remove that resource group?

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: remove-azurermresourcegroup -name Rg2. The screen prompts to confirm the removal of the resource group 'Rg2'. [Video description ends]

I'll type in the letter y for yes, just bear in mind that when you are removing a resource group, you are also removing the resources deployed into it.

Moving Azure Resources

[Video description begins] Topic title: Moving Azure Resources. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

You can use the portal to move Azure resources from one resource group to another. And remember that resource groups allow us to organize related cloud components, such as all of those underlying items required to support a web app. Or maybe we simply want to deploy virtual machines into a resource group called Project X, and so that we can track it by project, including at the building level. Either way, let's go ahead and do a move.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. [Video description ends]

To get started here, let's go to the Resource groups view. I've got two resource groups, Rg1 and Rg3.

[Video description begins] In the "Azure services" section he clicks the "Resource groups" option. The "Resource groups" blade opens. It includes a table with three columns and three rows. The column headers are Name, Subscription, and Location. He points to the second and third row entries, which include: Name: Rg1 and Name: Rg2. [Video description ends]

Let's go look at our Storage accounts, because we're going to move a storage account from one resource group to another.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the home page. In the "Azure services" section he clicks an option called "Storage accounts". A blade called "Storage accounts" opens. It includes a table with several columns and two rows. The column headers include Name, Resource group, and Location. [Video description ends]

It doesn't have to be a storage account, that just happens to be what we're using as our example. So I've got a storage account, and we can see right here, it's in a Resource group named Rg1, we're going to move it to Rg3.

[Video description begins] He points to the second row entry, which includes: Name: storacct33445, Resource group: Rg1, and Location: Canada Central. [Video description ends]

We might do this as part of a reorganization effort. So I'm going to click on the name of the storage account to open up its details.

[Video description begins] He clicks the second row entry and a blade called "storacct33445" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a button labeled "Move". [Video description ends]

And in the Overview blade, I have a Move button. So I could choose Move and move it to another resource group within the current subscription, or in another subscription.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Move" button and two options appear: Move to another resource group and Move to another subscription. [Video description ends]

I'm going to choose Move to another resource group.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Move resources" opens. It includes a drop-down list box labeled "Resource group" and a button labeled "OK". [Video description ends]

All I have to do here at the bottom is specify the target Resource group that I would like to move this item to, the Storage account. So I'm going to select Rg3.

[Video description begins] He selects the "Rg3" option in the "Resource group" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

I'll turn on the checkmark that says, I understand that tools and scripts associated with move resources might not work because I'm moving it to a different location. And I also might have to update them with the new resource ID.

[Video description begins] He switches to a new tab in the browser. The Microsoft Azure portal is open. The "storacct33445" blade is open. An option called "Properties" is selected in the navigation pane and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a field labeled "Storage account resource ID". [Video description ends]

So I've opened up another browser window here for my storage account, the one that we're moving, and I've gone to the Properties blade, where we can see the Storage account resource ID. Now, we're going to go ahead and verify that it is changed after we move it to our new resource group. Notice that part of that account resource ID includes the resource group name in the path. So let's go back over, we've checked that checkmark. Let's click OK to actually perform the move. Just make sure you're patient as the move occurs, especially if you're moving more than one resource at a time.

[Video description begins] He switches to the previous tab where the "Move resources" blade is open in the Microsoft Azure portal. He clicks the "OK" button. [Video description ends]

So if I click my notification bell icon in the upper right, we can still see it's moving that storage account resource. While that's happening, let's go back into our Resource groups view. And I'm going to open up an existing resource group, because what you can also do is choose to move at the resource group level.

[Video description begins] He opens the "Resource groups" blade. He selects the second row entry, which includes: Name: Rg1. The "Rg1" blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a button labeled "Move". [Video description ends]

What does this do? This will allow you to move all of the deployments associated with the resource group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Move" button and two options appear: Move to another resource group and Move to another subscription. He selects the "Move to another resource group" option. A blade called "Move resources" opens. It includes a drop-down list box labeled "Resource group" and a button labeled "OK". It also includes a table with two columns and one row. The column headers include "Resources to move" and "Type". The row entry includes, Name: storacct33445. [Video description ends]

And we can see currently, it still registers that our storage account is a part of this resource group. If you had many resources deployed here, they would all be listed. And you can see, you can select or deselect the ones and choose the target resource group to move them to. So you can do it at the resource group level or from the individual resource level.

[Video description begins] He closes the "Move resources" blade. [Video description ends]

Okay, before too long, we'll see that the moving of the resource is now complete. So we looked at the original storage account ID prior to the move. So the ID itself will not be changed, this numeric value, it starts with the 048b, it ends with 2109. I've opened up another web browser window after the move, so looking at the same resource, and the ID itself in terms of the numeric value portion has not changed. What's changed is the reference in the overall resource ID for the storage account. The reference to the resource group, here it's Rg3, and originally, it existed in Rg1. So as was suggested when we were doing this, you know, if you have any programmatic code or scripts that refer to the old resource ID, make sure they change to the new one.

Resource Group Deployments

[Video description begins] Topic title: Resource Group Deployments. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

You can view past resource deployments into an Azure resource group by opening up its properties in the portal, which we're going to do here. 

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. [Video description ends]

So to start with, let's go to the Resource groups view where we're going to see the resource groups within this subscription.

[Video description begins] In the "Azure services" section he clicks the "Resource groups" option. The "Resource groups" blade opens. It includes a table with three columns and three rows. The column headers are Name, Subscription, and Location. [Video description ends]

So for example, Rg1, resource group 1. If I click to open that resource group in the Overview blade, I'll see any resources currently deployed in that resource group.

[Video description begins] He clicks the second row entry, which includes: Name: Rg1. The "Rg1" blade opens. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a table with two columns and no rows. The column headers are Name and Type. It also includes a button labeled "Redeploy". [Video description ends]

Now here it says there are No resources to display. However, if I click on the Deployments item in the navigation bar, I can see that there have been deployments to this resource group in the past. So either those resources were deleted, or they were moved to another resource group.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Deployments" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and two rows. The column headers include "Deployment name" and "Status". [Video description ends]

So let's close this resource group for a moment and let's go into our second resource group here called Rg3.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the home page and opens a blade called "Rg3". It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a table with three columns and one row. [Video description ends]

So again in the Overview part of that, we do see there is an active object here within this resource group. It's a storage account.

[Video description begins] He points to the row entry, which includes: Name: storacct33445 and Location: Canada Central. [Video description ends]

And in the same way, if we go to the Deployments part, we'll see see that there are no deployments listed to this.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Deployments" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and no rows. The column headers include "Deployment name" and "Status". [Video description ends]

Well, how can that be when we can see there's a storage account currently assigned to Rg3? That would be because it must have been moved from another one. So let's go back into our initial resource group, Rg1, let's go the Deployments section.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the home page and opens "Rg1" blade. He selects an option called "Deployments" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

Now here I can see that there was a template deployment for one or more resources. We don't quite know yet, into this resource group on a specific date and time.

[Video description begins] He points to the first row entry, which includes: Deployment name: Microsoft.Template. He clicks the row entry, which includes: Deployment name: Microsoft.Template. A blade called "Microsoft.Template" opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a "download" link. [Video description ends]

Now if I click on the link for that template, I can actually Download the details related to that template, it's a zip file.

[Video description begins] The zip file opens in the file explorer window. It includes a file called "deployment.json". [Video description ends]

I'm just going to choose Open to open it up directly, and it going to open up the deployment.json file. This gives you the details about what in that template was deployed to the resource group.

[Video description begins] The file contains several lines of code. [Video description ends]

Unless we scroll down through here, it looks like it was a storage account, that looks like the only thing that was deployed here. So we can learn that quite easily by viewing that information.

[Video description begins] He closes the deployment.json file. He switches back to the browser. [Video description ends]

Now what's equally interesting about that, if I go back here to the Deployments, is if I select an existing deployment.

[Video description begins] He navigates back to the Deployments page in the "Rg1" blade. [Video description ends]

So we're here have a deployment of the storage account into this resource group. We have a Redeploy button up at the top.

[Video description begins] He selects the second row entry in the table, which includes: Deployment name: Microsoft.StorageAccount. [Video description ends]

And it means what it says, based on the selection, you can deploy that item again. Now you would only do that if it doesn't already exist. So for example, I'm going to click Redeploy. So this is what you would normally see if you were deploying from a template.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Custom deployment" opens. It includes a drop-down list box labeled "Resource group", a text box labeled "Storage Account Name", and a button labeled "Purchase". The following text is populated in the "Storage Account Name" text box: storacct33445. [Video description ends]

So I can select a Resource group where I want to deploy this item. So for example, Rg3 or I can create a new resource group, whatever the case might be. Now interestingly, even though it was originally deployed into Rg1, this storage account was moved to another resource group. And so it doesn't actually exist here anymore. So I'm going to deploy it back into Rg1. What I'm doing is creating a new storage account from that original deployment. I would do that if I want to use a lot of the settings from it as opposed to deploying a brand new storage account from scratch.

[Video description begins] He selects the "Rg1" option in the "Resource group" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

It's the only reason you would do this. So assuming I'm okay with all of these settings as per my original deployment. Then down at the bottom, I could choose that I agree to the terms and conditions stated above. The only thing I'll have to account for though is the name of the storage account. If that storage account is still being used somewhere, then the name isn't unique. So I'll just add a 2, let's say to the end of it, to make sure that the Storage Account Name is unique. I'll choose Purchase.

[Video description begins] He enters the following text in the "Storage Account Name" text box: storacct334452. [Video description ends]

And let's see if it validated, excellent. So the deployment is currently in progress. What we're doing is redeploying a storage account into this resource group based on a past deployment. Of course, the original storage account is no longer here. It's in Rg3. And after a moment, if I go look at my notification bell icon in the upper right, it looks like the resource deployment succeeded. Let's go back and look at the deployments here for our resource group.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the Deployments page in the "Rg1" blade. [Video description ends]

And let's take a look at the Overview here where we can see active current items here. And we can see that there is now a storage account that was deployed into Rg1 and we redeployed it from a past deployment.

[Video description begins] He selects the Overview option in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. The table now has one row entry, which includes: Name: storacct334452. [Video description ends]

Resource Group Cost Analysis

[Video description begins] Topic title: Resource Group Cost Analysis. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In Azure, you can view and track your costs based at the subscription level.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. In the "Azure services" section he clicks the "Subscriptions" option. The "Subscriptions" blade opens. It includes a table with several columns and one row. The column headers are Subscription name, Current cost, and Status. He clicks the row entry, which includes: Subscription name: Pay-As-You-Go. The "Pay-As-You-Go" blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So for example, here in the portal if I go to my Subscriptions, and if I click on an active subscription, when I open it up, I'll have the option of clicking Cost analysis over on the left.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Cost analysis" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a drop-down list box labeled "Invoice". [Video description ends]

And then I'll see all the costs associated with this subscription. Of course, I can change the time period or time frame for which that is representative of, but we have the option of doing that. But what we're talking about here is doing a cost analysis at the resource group level. Now think about how you might use a resource group in Azure, you might use it for a project, so you might have a project called Project X. So you'd create a resource group with that same name and deploy project resources into it. That way you have a single unit of management in the resource group and also for tracking costs. Let's take a look at that.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the home page. In the "Azure services" section, he selects the "Resource groups" option. The "Resource groups" blade opens. It includes a table with three columns and three rows. The column headers are Name, Subscription, and Location. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go into my Resource groups view here in Azure, and I'm going to open up an existing resource group I've got named Rg1, so I'll click on it.

[Video description begins] He clicks the second row entry, which includes: Name: Rg1. The "Rg1" blade opens. It is divided into two parts: navigation pane and content pane. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. [Video description ends]

And what I want to do is scroll down in the navigation bar and click on Cost analysis to open that blade.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Cost analysis" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a button labeled "Export" and a graph showing accumulated cost. The x axis shows the dates and the y axis shows the cost in CA$. The page also includes three pie charts labeled "Service name", "Location", and "Resource group name". It also includes an "Add filter" button. [Video description ends]

So what's going to happen is we're going to see a cost breakdown for resources deployed only into this resource group. And we can see it's coming up with the numbers listed here. So we have our standard charts where we can scroll down below and see it broken down by service. So it looks like we've got SQL databases eating up the lion share of the cost in this particular case for this time frame, the location here, Canada East. So we have all the normal stuff that we would normally see we can even filter. I could add a filter here for anything that I'm interested in such as a specific service type or Service name in this case. So I could open up the list and choose that I'm only interested in sql database.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Add filter" button and two drop-down list boxes appear. He chooses the "service name" option in the first drop-down list box and the " sql database" option in the second drop-down list box. The graph gets updated. [Video description ends]

And I could filter based only on sql database. So then the cost analysis will update to show me only that. And as usual, we also have the option of exporting. So for example, I could choose to Export.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Export" button and a blade called "Export" opens. It includes a button labeled "Download charts". [Video description ends]

Let's see a PNG graphic file. Let's go ahead and do that. And I'll click Download charts. And once that's done, I'll just click Open down at the bottom of the screen. And we can see here it's opened it up in Paint on my machine, but we essentially have the same type of information that we can see visually directly in the Azure portal. Let's go back and export that as, let's say a, document in the format of Excel. So I'm going to choose Excel and choose Download data. And then I'll just go ahead and click on Open. So when you open it in Excel, you're going to have two sheets. You could have a worksheet, which is the summary that you're looking at here and also the actual data itself.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Cost alerts" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a button labeled "Add". [Video description ends]

So not only can we work with our cost analysis at this level at the resource group level, but we can also go into Cost alerts over on the left and Add an alert and notification when the costs for resources deployed into this resource group get to a certain level.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Add" button. A page called "Create a budget" opens. It includes a text box labeled "Name", a drop-down list box labeled "Reset period", a text box labeled "Amount", and a button labeled "Next >". The "Billing month" option is selected in the "Reset period" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

So I could add a filter. I'm just going to leave it on Rg1, I'm not going to change the scope. And I'm going to call this Rg1Budgets1.

[Video description begins] He types "Rg1Budgets1" in the "Name" text box. [Video description ends]

Now, the idea here is that we want to be alerted when costs exceed a certain value. So I can specify the period. I'm going to leave it on Billing month but I could specify quarter here, and so on. And I'm going to set the amount here to 50. So as I scroll down, I can see here that the max over the past five months has been about $25 specifically in Canadian dollars.

[Video description begins] He types "50" in the "Amount" text box. [Video description ends]

So, it depends on your subscription and how it's configured for the currency. So that's been specified. So now that I've done that, I'm going to go ahead and click on Next>. So, we scroll back up to the top.

[Video description begins] A page called "Set alerts" opens. It includes a button labeled "Create" and a table with several columns and one row entry. The column headers include "% of budget" and "Action group". Under the "% of budget" column header the row entry is a text box. Under the "Action group" column header the row entry is a drop-down list box. Under the table there is a link called "Manage action group". [Video description ends]

Basically, I'm going to say when we get to 75% of our budgeted amount, I want to use an existing Action group if we have any, in order to send a notification. Now if we don't have any existing action groups that are available in the list, then we can click the Manage action group link.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the row entry under the "% of budget" column header: 75. [Video description ends]

Down below, we can also specify an alert recipient email address, such as for a group, which I've specified here. And then I can just click Create.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in a text box labeled "Alert recipients": admins@quick24x7.com. [Video description ends]

So I didn't create an Action Group, I could have, if I wanted as an alternative alert notification method like SMS text or something like that. So at this point, we now have a budget created. So, if I go into the Budgets.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Budgets" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and one row. The column headers are Name and Scope. He points to the row entry, which includes: Name: Rg1Budgets1. [Video description ends]

Portion here, I can see our budget is listed here for the resource group. So the key is that we can work with cost analysis at the resource group level.

Resource Group Budgets

[Video description begins] Topic title: Resource Group Budgets. The presenter is Dan Lachance. [Video description ends]

In Azure, you create budgets so that you can be notified when a certain percentage of a given value has been reached. For example, if you set a budget for $500 per month, you might want to be notified when you get to 80% of that $500.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. [Video description ends]

So I can go in and take a look to make sure that issues such as leaving virtual machines or databases running by mistake hasn't occurred, and that's why you have an increase in cost. So we can do this at the subscription level.

[Video description begins] In the "Azure services" section, he selects the "Subscriptions" option. The "Subscriptions" blade opens. It includes a button labeled "Add" and a table with several columns and one row. The column headers include "Subscription name", "Status", and "Current cost". [Video description ends]

If I were to go into an Azure subscription, I can click on the subscription to open it up, and I can click Budgets and manage the budgets from there.

[Video description begins] He clicks the row entry under the "Subscription name" column: Pay-As-You-Go. A blade called "Pay-As-You-Go" opens. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. He selects an option called "Budgets" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. [Video description ends]

But what we're talking about in this particular case is doing same type of thing but at the resource group level.

[Video description begins] He navigates to the home page. In the "Azure services" section he clicks an option called "Resource groups". A blade called "Resource groups" opens. It includes a table with three columns and three rows. The column headers include Name, Subscription, and Location. [Video description ends]

So it only applies to charges for resources deployed to a specific resource group. So in my Resource groups view, I'm going to click on a resource group I have called Rg1.

[Video description begins] He clicks the second row entry, which includes: Name: Rg1. The "Rg1" blade opens. In the navigation pane, an option labeled "Overview" is selected and its corresponding page is open in the content pane. It includes a table with two columns and one row. The column headers include "Name" and "Type". The row entry includes, Name: storacct334452. [Video description ends]

And in the Overview blade over on the right, I can see any resources currently deployed there. In this case, it's only a single storage account. However, as I scroll down in the navigation bar for the resource group, I can see Cost analysis, Cost alerts, and Budgets. Well, Cost alerts allows me to add an alert which ends up creating a budget. I'm just going to go here to the Budgets view. I don't have any budgets currently.

[Video description begins] He selects an option called "Budgets" in the navigation pane and its corresponding page opens in the content pane. It includes a table with several columns and no rows. The column headers are Name and Scope. It also includes a button labeled "Add". [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go ahead and click the Add button to add a new budget. Now remember again, the budget is really about sending a numeric threshold value for costs.

[Video description begins] A page called "Create a budget" opens. It includes a button labeled "Next >" and a section called "BUDGET SCOPING". In this section there is a Scope label, adjacent to which the "Rg1" option appears. Under this option there is a link called "Change scope". Under this link there is a button labeled "Add filter". [Video description ends]

And then setting up some kind of an alert notification mechanism. So Rg1 is the current scope. I'm not going to change that. I could click Add filter, if I want to filter within the resource group by something else.

[Video description begins] Two drop-down list boxes appear adjacent to the "Add filter" button. [Video description ends]

So maybe for example, by ServiceName. Maybe, I'm only interested in looking at sql database costs within Rg1 and sending alerts for that, so I could do that. However, I'm going to remove that filter by clicking the little x.

[Video description begins] The "Create budget" page also includes a section called "BUDGET DETAILS". This section includes a text box labeled "Name", a drop-down list box labeled "Reset period", and another text box labeled "Amount ($)". [Video description ends]

And down below, I'm going to call this Rg1Budget1All, indicating it's for all costs, not by particular service or anything like that.

[Video description begins] He types "Rg1Budget1All" in the "Name" text box. [Video description ends]

I'm going to leave it on billing month, but you can change the period to be something different, like monthly, maybe you only want to track this and be notified from a quarterly perspective or annual. But I want it done every Billing month.

[Video description begins] The following option is preselected in the "Reset period" drop-down list box: Billing month. [Video description ends]

I can see the start and ending date for that. I'll leave those set as they are, so two years into the future, pretty much. I'm going to set my BUDGET AMOUNT to 500, so $500 and that will be in the currency specified with my subscription, in my case, Canadian dollars.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the "Amount ($)" text box: 500. [Video description ends]

I can see my past five month maximum costs, which can help me sometimes gauge what I should be putting in for my budget amount. However, I'm going to leave mine at $500. Could go down to the bottom, I'm going to click Next>.

[Video description begins] A page called "Set alerts" opens. It includes a table with several columns and one row entry. The column headers include "% of budget" and "Action group". Under the "% of budget" column header the row entry is a text box. Under the "Action group" column header the row entry is a drop-down list box. Under the table there is a link called "Manage action group". [Video description ends]

And I'll scroll back up here because I can specify the percentage of that budget amount, then I want to trigger an alert. So let's say it's 80% of that $500, which works out as we can see here to be $400.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in the row entry under the "% of budget" column header: 80. [Video description ends]

I could select an existing Action group, if I have one, I don't, or I could create one by going to Manage action group. Action groups let you define targets that should receive things like notifications. Whether it's through email, or SMS text messages, or push notifications and so on. However, I already have the option built-in here when I'm creating a budget to send an alert message to a group. So I'm going to specify a group here for my organization. And they were the ones that will receive a notification when we get to 80% of our budget on a monthly billing basis.

[Video description begins] He types the following text in a text box labeled "Alert recipients": admins@quick24x7.com. [Video description ends]

And having done that, I'm going to go ahead and click on Create. So it's going to validate my selections, after which it will create the budget.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Create". [Video description ends]

After a moment, we get a notification in the upper right that the Budget was created. And here, in the Rg1, navigation panel under the Budgets blade, we can see our budget now exists.

[Video description begins] A new row entry gets added to the table on the "Budgets" page of the "Rg1" blade. [Video description ends]

So at any point in time, we can click on the Name of the budget and open it up and either edit it to change any of the items within it, such as the Amount, or we can delete the budget.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Rg1Budget1All" appears. It includes two buttons labeled "Edit budget" and "Delete budget". [Video description ends]

Azure ARM Template Editor

[Video description begins] Topic title: Azure ARM Template Editor. The presenter is Dan Lachance . [Video description ends]

Azure Resource Manager templates, otherwise called ARM, for Azure Resource Manager, allow you to define your resources as code. It's often referred to as Infrastructure as Code.

[Video description begins] The Microsoft Azure portal is open. [Video description ends]

So you could use a template or a blueprint to specify that you want to create a storage account, a virtual machine, a web application, a public IP address, all of these things together. It allows for the automation for the deployment and management of resources. So here in the portal, I can create a template deployment by choosing Create a resource, and I could type in template, and I'm going to select Template deployment.

[Video description begins] A blade called "New" opens. [Video description ends]

Now a template is technically just a text file that uses json syntax.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Template deployment" opens. It includes a button labeled "Create". [Video description ends]

Now from this screen, we can select from Common templates that are available here in Azure.

[Video description begins] A blade called "Custom deployment" opens. It includes a "Build your own template in the editor" link. [Video description ends]

So to create a Linux virtual machine, Windows virtual machine, a web app, a SQL database. You could also, down below, select a GitHub quickstart template from the list. So whether you want to start working with things like Azure container services or kubernetes, which is kind of an orchestration platform for containerized applications. Or we might go down and choose things like an Azure DNS zone that we want to create. It could be any type of resource, a backup vault to be created, content delivery networks, on and on and on. Or you could Build your own template in the editor. When I do that, it takes me into an editor environment where we have the base skeletal format for the JSON.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Build your own template in the editor" link and a blade called "Edit template" opens. The blade is divided into three sections, The first section contains four buttons labeled: Add resource, Quickstart template, Load file, and Download. The second section includes "Parameters", "Variables", and "Resources" nodes. The third section is an editor. [Video description ends]

Now we can also specify Variables. If you want to allow for template reusability, you shouldn't be hard coding values, things like storage account names or virtual machine names. Instead, those should be variables, and you can specify those parameters to pass in values to those variables. Now, at this point, we could load an existing file. When I choose Load file, it allows me to search for file on-premises, on my local computer that I'm doing this from, that is a template that I want to bring in here. Or I could choose Quickstart template, for example.

[Video description begins] He clicks the "Quickstart template" button and a "Select a template" drop-down list box appears and a button labeled "OK". [Video description ends]

I'm going to go through and select just a very simple template. How about we search for storage, and we'll take a look here for storage account. Now, what I want to do is basically create a very basic storage account using a template, so that we can at least see the code here. So I'll choose storage-account-create, from the template list, OK.

[Video description begins] He selects the "101-storage-account-create" option in the "Select a template" drop-down list box. He then clicks the "OK" button. [Video description ends]

And what it's done is populated all of the json syntax here in my ARM template for the creation of a storage account.

[Video description begins] Several lines of code get populated in the editor. [Video description ends]

Now notice there are some variables here. A variable is being defined here for the storageAccountName. And, If I click Variables over here on the left and expand it by clicking little triangle, I can see storageAccountName.

[Video description begins] He highlights the following line of code, code starts: "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]". Code ends. [Video description ends]

Of course, when I click it, it takes me to that line. So I can use this template editor to tweak what I've just essentially imported from a Quickstart template. I can make changes, if I know what I'm doing. And once I'm happy with this, I can actually save it. So if I click Save, at this point it's saved my changes here in the GUI. And what I can then do is actually run a deployment from that template.

[Video description begins] The "Custom deployment" blade includes a drop-down list box labeled "Resource group" and a drop-down list box labeled "Storage Account Type". [Video description ends]

So, for example, I want to deploy a storage account into Rg1, that's a Resource group.

[Video description begins] He selects the "Rg1" option in the "Resource group" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

And based on the template definition will determine what you need to specify. If pretty much everything is hardwired and there are no variables, then you might not have much to specify at all. But here we can specify the Storage Account Type. And the Location will be determined by looking at the Resource group up above, and calling upon its .location property.

[Video description begins] He selects the "Standard_LRS" option in the "Storage Account Type" drop-down list box. [Video description ends]

So that's going to be taken care of. Notice what's missing is the name. What will the name of the storage account be? Well, in the template the storage account name is going to be determined by concatenating some text items together. Let's just go back here for a moment in our web browser, and let's step through what we just did to create that template. We created a Template deployment, we chose Create, we wanted to use the template editor here in the GUI, and we clicked on Quickstart template. And essentially what we searched for here was storage. We want to create a storage account using the template. So, storage-account-create, we did OK. Now if we take a look here at the code within the template, when it comes to dealing with the storage account name, it's concatenating the word store, so that's going to be the prefix. Then it's going to generate a unique string from the resource group ID. And so, that is how the name will be derived.

[Video description begins] He highlights the following line of code, code starts: "storageAccountName": "[concat('store', uniquestring(resourceGroup().id))]". Code ends. [Video description ends]

Okay, let's get back to where we were. Let's Save that. Let's deploy this into Rg1. And let's go ahead and agree with it and click Purchase.

[Video description begins] He clicks a button labeled "Purchase". [Video description ends]

And after a moment, our template deployment has succeeded for a storage account. So we can go to the resource group, that's one way to navigate here. And in the Overview blade, we'll see any items deployed in this location. Now we might have to click Refresh, a time or two until we see new items. Here's our new storage account. Notice, it's got store as part of the prefix of the name followed by what looks like some kind of a unique string. Now the same thing would appear, of course, if we were to go to the Storage accounts view. Creating a storage account is the same, regardless of how you actually do it, the end result is the same. So our storage account is now showing up as having been created from a template that we pulled up in the template editor.

                    
Azure AD Overview
Azure Active Directory is otherwise called Azure AD or sometimes AAD, but it all means the same thing. It means that we have an Active Directory instance in the Azure Cloud. It's managed. We don't have to set up a server and install the domain, controller, components, and so on. So what this means is that we have a centralized identity provider in the cloud. It can contain users, groups, application registrations, and security principles. Security principles are often used to make sure that software components have specific permissions to needed cloud resources. You can also link Azure Active Directory to your on-premises Active Directory if you wish. There are many configurations such that users authenticate to cloud apps using their familiar on-prem apps, and password changes are synchronized between both locations.
You can manage Azure Active Directory and everything within it using the GUI. So using the portal, you can also use command-line management tools, like PowerShell cmdlets, and the Azure CLI. Identity in Access Management or IAM, is all about authentication in authorization. So authentication is the proving of identity. Single factor authentication, for users for instance, would include items in the same category, such as something you know as a username and password would be. So it's single factor. But multi-factor meshes categories. So username and password fall under the something you know category, but the possession of a smartcard falls under the something you have category. Hence, we would have Multifactor Authentication or MFA in that instance.
The authorization is controlled access to resources that occurs after successful authentication, such as having the appropriate permissions to a SharePoint site, or perhaps the ability to deploy specific virtual machines only within a specific geographical region. So it's permissions or policies that get assigned to groups. So with Identity and Access Management or IAM, we are talking about controlling the authentication and then the authorization related to users and groups and even devices, such as Windows 10 computers joined to Azure AD, or Android smartphones registered with Azure AD for centralized control. And we know that IAM also deals with software permissions, specifically in the form of security principles.
So Azure AD then is a centralized repository of credentials, you could say, among other things. There are other security things that we have to consider, like RBAC roles. RBAC stands for Role Based Access Control. A role is a collection of related permissions, such as the ability to manage Azure virtual machines. And we could assign that role to certain users, or groups, that would apply to either the entire subscription in Azure, or a resource group, or just a single virtual machine for that matter. Conditional access is an important option. You can build policies that basically check conditions that must be met before allowing access to something.
So an example is that, if we have a sales associate that needs access to some kind of a Sales Cloud based application, then they can only do that, they can only access it if they sign in using Multifactor Authentication. Then we've got access reviews. This is something that you can schedule or run whenever you wish to take a look at things like group memberships in Azure AD, or permissions granted to enterprise applications registered in Azure AD. Because sometimes these permissions are granted and left, even though they may no longer be required, and that presents a security risk. So access reviews are good from a security perspective.
Then there's Privileged Identity Management, otherwise called PIM, P-I-M. The purpose of PIM is really to only provide administrative access to administrators when they need it. So you could think of this as, just-in-time or J-I-T, JIT administrative access. And of course, we can enable Multifactor Authentication or MFA to enhance user sign in security. So for instance, instead of Azure AD users only being required to enter a username and password, in addition to that, they might have to enter a six-digit PIN that gets texted to their smartphone.


Azure AD and the Portal
To properly manage Microsoft Azure, it's important to have a clear understanding of the association of an Azure AD tenant and a subscription. Now, an Azure AD tenant is essentially an instance of Azure Active Directory in the cloud, where you have users and groups, and devices and so on.

[Video description begins] A web portal labeled "Home - Microsoft Azure" opens. It is divided into two parts: menu bar and content pane. The menu bar includes a search box and some icons such as, Settings, Help, and User's login information. The content pane is divided into three sections labeled "Azure services", "Navigate", and "Tools". [Video description ends]

And you can associate a subscription with a tenant, for example, here in the portal in the upper right along with my sign in information, I can see the name of the Azure AD tenant I'm currently switched to it's called QUICK24X7.

[Video description begins] He points to the User's login information labeled "danlachance72@hotmail.com QUICK24X7". An information box opens which contains information labeled "Name", "Email", "Directory", and "Domain". [Video description ends]

And so here, I can click Subscriptions on my screen, I can also search for subscriptions if it wasn't there, to view any subscriptions associated with this Azure AD tenant. And I see I've got one it's a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. So I'm just going to click Home here in the upper left.

[Video description begins] He points to an option labeled "Subscriptions" in the Azure services section. Then he types sub in the search box and its search result includes a link labeled "Subscriptions". He clicks the Subscription link and its corresponding blade opens. It includes a subscriptions table with multiple columns and a row. The column headers include Subscription name and Status. Their respective row entries are Pay-As-You-Go and Active. [Video description ends]

So if I were to view for example, All resources, it takes me to the All resources view but I have not yet created anything so I don't really see anything, but at least it did take me to the view. Now let me switch over to a different Azure AD tenant.

[Video description begins] The Home - Microsoft Azure web portal opens. He clicks an option labeled "All resources" in the Azure services section and its corresponding blade opens. It includes an all resources table with multiple columns and no rows. The column headers include Name and Type. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to click in the upper right and choose Switch directory, and maybe I'll choose the one by the name of EarthFarm.

[Video description begins] He clicks the User's information and a drop-down box with two sections displays. The first section contains a user ID and two links labeled "My Microsoft account" and "Switch directory". He clicks the Switch directory link and its corresponding blade labeled "Directory + subscription" opens. It includes a tab labeled "All Directories" which is selected by default. It contains a search box and a list of directories. Some of the directories are labeled "Default Directory" and "EarthFarm". [Video description ends]

So this is a separate Azure AD tenant or separate instance of Azure AD Directory Services.

[Video description begins] The Home - Microsoft Azure web portal with the EARTHFARM AD tenant opens. It is divided into various sections. Some of the sections are labeled "Azure services" and "Navigate". The Navigate section includes an option labeled "Subscriptions". [Video description ends]

Now when I take a look here, I have a different looking screen. And if I were to try, for example, to look about why don't we start by trying to see which subscriptions are associated with this tenant. So when I go to Subscriptions for EarthFarm, there are none although I do have the ability to add one, let me just go back Home.

[Video description begins] He clicks the Subscriptions option and its corresponding blade opens. It includes a button labeled "Add" and the subscriptions table. [Video description ends]

If I were to try to go to the All resources view, well, it just won't let me do it. Because you need to at least have a subscription associated with the Azure AD tenant to be able to do anything.

[Video description begins] The Home - Microsoft Azure web portal opens. He clicks the All resources option in the Azure services section. A web page labeled "Welcome to Azure" opens. It includes buttons labeled "Start", "View" and "Explore". [Video description ends]

So let's switch back to our active tenant, but when I say that what I really mean is the one that has an associated subscription, that was Quick24x7. 

[Video description begins] He clicks the User's information. Then he clicks the Switch directory link and the Directory + subscription blade opens. Then in the All Directories tab, he selects a directory labeled "Quick24x7" from the directory list. The Home - Microsoft Azure web portal opens. [Video description ends]

Now when I look at Quick24x7, we can go to Azure Active Directory from the main screen, we could also search for it and choose it from the resultant list.

[Video description begins] He points to an option labeled "Azure Active Directory" in the Azure services section. Then he types azure in the search box displayed in the menu bar and its result includes a link labeled "Azure Active Directory". He points to the Azure Active Directory link. [Video description ends]

I could click on my left-hand navigation bar to open it up, and scroll down and choose Azure Active Directory, it doesn't matter. But at this point I can start actually doing something meaningful with Azure AD.

[Video description begins] A navigation pane opens. It is divided into various sections labeled "All Services" and "FAVORITES". The FAVORITES section includes an option labeled "Azure Active Directory". He clicks the Azure Active Directory option and its corresponding blade labeled "Quick24x7 | Overview" opens. It is divided into two sections: navigation pane and content pane. The navigation pane includes an option labeled "Overview". The Overview option is selected by default and its corresponding blade is displayed in the content pane. [Video description ends]

For example, I could go to the Users view, I can see any existing users, or begin creating users, or inviting users, or bulk creating them from a CSV file.

[Video description begins] The navigation pane includes a section labeled "Manage" which further includes an option labeled "Users". He clicks the Users option and its corresponding blade labeled "Users | All users" opens. It is divided into two sections: navigation pane and content pane. The navigation pane includes an option labeled "All users" and its corresponding blade is displayed in the content pane. It includes buttons labeled "New user", "Bulk create", and "Bulk invite". [Video description ends]

I'll just click back on Quick24x7 in the breadcrumb trail in the upper left, I can also view Groups and also Devices.

[Video description begins] He opens the Quick24x7 | Overview blade. Then he points to options labeled "Groups" and "Devices" under the Manage section in the navigation pane. Then he clicks the Devices option and its corresponding blade opens. It is divided into two sections: navigation pane and content pane. The navigation pane includes an option labeled "All devices" and its corresponding blade is displayed in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So Azure AD then is a centralized cloud-based identity provider that can have one or more Azure subscriptions associated with it.


Azure AD and the CLI
While you can use the Azure portal to manage and navigate through your Azure AD tenant, you can also do that using the Azure CLI.

[Video description begins] The Quick24x7 | Overview blade opens in the Home - Microsoft Azure web portal. [Video description ends]

In this case in the portal, I'm going to click the Cloud Shell icon at the top where I'm going to run CLI commands.

[Video description begins] He clicks an icon labeled "Cloud Shell" in the menu bar and a PowerShell command prompt displays in the web portal. The PS /home/danlachance72> prompt is displayed. [Video description ends]

The first thing I'm going to do is run az account list and I'll press Enter.

[Video description begins] He executes the az account list command. The output displays several properties of the live.com#danlachance72@hotmail.com user account. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So the first thing I see is the homeTenantId, so it starts here with 96421. Now as a matter of fact, if I just minimize that, we can see that 96421 is actually the tenant ID for my Azure AD tenant which is named, Quick24x7.

[Video description begins] He highlights home Tenant Id user account property starting with 96421 in the output. Then he minimizes the PowerShell command prompt and the Quick24x7 | Overview blade displays. He highlights an information labeled "Tenant ID" in the content pane. [Video description ends]

So we can see that information. As we go further down, we can also see the name of the subscription associated with that Azure AD tenant, because there can be one or more subscriptions.

[Video description begins] He opens the PowerShell command prompt. Then he highlights Pay-As-You-Go subscription property of the user account in the output. [Video description ends]

So I'm going to go ahead and minimize Cloud Shell for a second. And I'm going to search up subscriptions in the bar at the top center here. And when I do that, I'll be able to see which Subscriptions are associated with the Quick24x7 tenant. There's one, it's called Pay-As-You-Go.

[Video description begins] He types sub in the search box displayed in the menu bar and clicks the Subscriptions link in the result. Its corresponding Subscriptions blade opens which includes the subscriptions table in the content pane. He points to the Pay-As-You-Go row entry under the Subscription name column header. [Video description ends]

We can see the Subscription ID for that is 048b82 and so on. Well, let's go back and take a look here.

[Video description begins] He opens the PowerShell command prompt. [Video description ends]

We can also see Pay-As-You-Go is shown here. The state of our subscription is that it's Enabled, okay. So this looks good. We're getting a bit of information simply from the az account list about our Azure AD tenant. I'm going to go ahead and just clear the screen with cls. Let's take a look at a few other things that we could do.

[Video description begins] He executes the cls command and the screen gets clear. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

For example, I'm going to run az space ad space -h for help. What can I do in Azure Active Directory here from the CLI?

[Video description begins] He executes the az ad -h command. The output displays a list of Group's command and Subgroups' keywords with their definitions. The Group's command is labeled "az ad". The Subgroups' keywords are labeled "app", "group", "signed-in-user", "sp", and "user". The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So we can manage applications that are registered, groups. We can get information about the signed-in-user. We can manage service principals which is often used when you have software components that need authorization to resources in Azure, like storage accounts for instance. And we can manage of course Azure AD users. So if I were to run az ad user -h, tells me the next level commands about users I can work with.

[Video description begins] He executes the az ad user -h command. The output displays a list of commands with their definitions. The Group's command is labeled "az ad user". The other commands are labeled "create", "delete", "get-member-groups", "list", "show", and "update". The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So create, delete, get-member-groups, list, show, update, and so on. So there's a lot we can learn from within the help system. So for example, if I were to run az ad signed-inuser -h, just talks a little bit about what that would do.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the az ad signed-inuser -h command. An error message displays. [Video description ends]

Well, looks like I have the wrong name here, so signed-in-user. So make sure you have the command syntax spelled out correctly, that's a little bit better.

[Video description begins] He executes the az ad signed-in-user -h command. The output displays three commands labeled "az ad signed-in-user -h", "list-owned-objects", and "show". The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So show graph information about the current signed-in user in the CLI, okay, so we can either run list-owned-objects after that or show. Let's just do show. So I'm going to use the up arrow key and our full command that is going to be az ad signed-in-user show. Just to get some information about who we're currently signed in as here in the CLI.

[Video description begins] He highlights a definition of the az ad signed-in-user command. Then he points to the show command. Then he clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the az ad signed-in-user show command and its output displays several properties of the user account. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So as we scroll up, it's a lot of details because it's showing me the properties of my user account. So things like the companyName, the country, department, employeeId, displayName, givenName, all of those types of things. And as we go further and further down, we can also see all the details all the way down. So it's just showing me details about the user that I'm currently signed in as here in the CLI. Now of course, we can do other things here, navigating through our Azure AD tenant for example, az ad group list. So this will show me all my groups, but the problem if you consider it a problem is that it's telling me too much. It's giving me all of the detail. I'm really only interested in the displayName property.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the az ad group list command. The output displays a list of user account properties. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So what can we do about that? We can do a few things. One thing I could do is run az ad group list again and pipe that to grep. That's the grep line filtering tool built into Linux. And I can tell it what I want to see, and it's case sensitive by default. So I want to see the displayName, name with capital N, I can ask for that and that seems to work. Those are the names of my Azure AD groups.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group list | grep displayName. The output displays four user account properties that are labeled "EastAdmins", "Off365Group" "All Enabled Users", and "Group1". The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

I can also alternatively use the --query parameter built in to the Azure CLI. So for example, I could do az ad group list, and instead of grep and grep is fine. But instead of that I could use --query and I can tell it I want to see the displayName. 

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group list --query displayName. No output displays. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Now the problem is that it won't work by default because what we have is a collection of items. We have an array of items and those items are the multiple groups. So we have to tell it here in our syntax after query, open and close square bracket. In other words, array element dot and for each item I want to see the displayName property. And when I do that, I get what I expect, the names of the groups.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: az ad group list --query [].displayName. The output displays the same display names without the displayName label. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

And it's a little bit cleaner, if you take a look at than what do you get when you use a grep line filtering. Because grep displays everything on the line, so displayName colon all that stuff. All we're seeing here are the actual value. So depending on what your need is, it might be easier to parse this text down below that results from using --query than it would from trying to parse the text that results up above here by piping to grep.


Azure AD and PowerShell
Not only can we use the Azure portal to manage our Azure AD tenant, as well as the Azure CLI, we can also use PowerShell cmdlets.

[Video description begins] The Quick24x7 | Overview blade opens in the Home - Microsoft Azure web portal. [Video description ends]  

Whether you're running PowerShell on-premises with the Azure module, or whether you're doing it here in the portal through Cloud Shell, which is what I'm going to do. So I'm going to point to Cloud Shell here, which allows me to run PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI commands.

[Video description begins] He points to the Cloud Shell icon in the menu bar. Then he clicks it to open the PowerShell command prompt. The PS /home/danlachance72> prompt is displayed. [Video description ends]

So I'm using PowerShell here. And to get started here, let's just navigate a little bit around Azure AD. Let's figure out what we can type in, begin with. So get-command, and let's say I want to retrieve information about Azure AD. So I know that the verb part of that cmdlet, the prefix, is going to be get. Don't know what would be after that so how about a wildcard symbol, an asterisk. And probably azad and then something else.

[Video description begins] He executes the get -command get*azad* command. Its output displays a table with four columns and multiple rows. The column headers are CommandType, Name, Version, and Source. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Looks pretty good. Here I can use Get-AzADGroup to get groups from my directory, or group members. I can get users, I can get applications that might have been registered in Azure AD. So this isn't bad, we're learning a bit. So I'm going to clear the screen, I'm going to run get-azadgroup.

[Video description begins] He highlights the following commands under the Name column header: Get-AzADGroup, Get-AzADGroupMember, Get-AzADUser, and Get-AzADApplication. [Video description ends]

Let's see what groups we have.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get -azadgroup command. The output displays a list of groups and their properties. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Okay, looks like it's showing us the groups with the default selection of properties. However, if we really wanted to, we could also run get-azadgroup. I know there's more about groups than just those list of properties. So what I could do is, tell it that I want to pipe that, to select, and I'll tell it I want to select all properties, select *.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get -azadgroup | select * command. The output displays a list of groups and their properties. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Now what we could also do is pipe that command to the select alias and select specifically the properties that we want. So get-azadgroup, let's say, and pipe that to select and say I only want to see the displayname. So we can ask it for which properties we are interested. So that's all we see. Now you might wonder, how do you know it's called DisplayName?

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get -azadgroup | select displayname command. The output displays four group names. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Well, if you're not sure what these properties are called, you can pipe the result of a cmdlet in PowerShell to get-member. And you can ask it for properties, so -type property, otherwise it'll show you properties and methods. And here I can see, indeed, there is a property called DisplayName, and MailNickname, and so on and so forth.

[Video description begins] He executes the following command: get -azadgroup | get-member -type property command. The output displays a table with three columns and multiple rows. The column headers are Name, MemberType, and Definition. The prompt remains the same. In the output, he highlights DisplayName and MailNickname row entries under the Name column header. [Video description ends]

So we can learn about that quite easy. Now another thing that I might be interested in doing is running get-azureadcurrentsessioninfo, it's a long one.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get -azureadcurrentsessioninfo command. The output displays an error message which reads, You must call the Connect-AzureAD cmdlet before calling any other cmdlets. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Well, it's actually telling me I need to first run connect-azuread. Okay, let's do that, up arrow. Let's go back to get-azureadcurrentsessioninfo. All right, this is telling me some interesting stuff.

[Video description begins] He executes the connect-azuread command. No output displays. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get -azureadcurrentsessioninfo command. The output displays a table with five columns and a row. The column headers are Account, Environment, TenantId, TenantDomain, and AccountType. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

So I can see here the tenant ID for my Azure AD tenant starts with 96421. And if we go back here and check that in the portal, yeah, that looks right, that's correct.

[Video description begins] He highlights the Tenant ID starting with 96421 and minimizes the PowerShell command prompt. The Quick24x7 | Overview blade displays. Then he highlights 96421 in the Tenant ID displayed in the content pane. [Video description ends]

We can also see our domain name. So we aren't using a custom DNS domain here because we've got the .onmicrosoft.com DNS suffix.

[Video description begins] He opens the PowerShell command prompt. Then he highlights onmicrosoft.com in the quick24x7test.onmicrosoft.com row entry under the TenantDomain column header. [Video description ends]

We can also run cmdlets here in PowerShell, like get-azureadtenantdetail. And when I do that it's just giving me a little bit of the same type of listing from above, just presented in a different format.

[Video description begins] He executes the get -azureadtenantdetail command. The output displays a table with three columns and a row. The column headers are ObjectId, DisplayName, and VerifiedDomain. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

Now, of course, if I want to manage Azure AD objects such as building users, I could also do that by searching up what the appropriate cmdlets are, so get-command. Let's see, I'm assuming it starts with new, and it's probably got user in the name. Looks about right, such as new-AzADUser. And I can take that further, say well, what else can I do with users?

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get-command new *user* command. The output displays a table with four columns and multiple rows. The column headers are CommandType, Name, Version, and Source. The prompt remains the same. He highlights New-AzADUser row entry under the Name column header. [Video description ends]

get-command *azaduser*, okay. So I can build a new one. I can retrieve Azure AD users. I can update something about them. I can remove them, and so on.

[Video description begins] He executes the get-command *azaduser* command. The output displays a table with four columns and multiple rows. The column headers are CommandType, Name, Version, and Source. The prompt remains the same. He points to Get-AzADUser, New-AzADUser, Remove-AzADUser, and Update-AzADUser row entries under the Name column header. [Video description ends]

So if I were to run, get-azaduser, then we can see in fact, it's showing me the user accounts. And just like with the groups, if I really want to, I can pipe that.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get-azaduser command. The output displays user accounts and their properties. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

For example, to select and tell it what I want to see, which properties. I want displayname.

[Video description begins] He clears the screen. The prompt remains the same. Then he executes the get-azaduser | select displayname command. The output displays user account names. The prompt remains the same. [Video description ends]

And in the same way, I can also discover which properties are there with get-member. So piping to get-member -type property. And we can see some of those properties listed there.


Azure AD Users and the Portal
You can use the Azure portal to create Azure AD user accounts.
Now why would you create an Azure AD user account? You would do this so that you have a way to allow people to authenticate, so they can access things like cloud-based apps, and in some cases, depending on your configuration, also on-premises apps. So to get started here in the portal, I'm going to go to Azure Active Directory. I could also launch that from my left-hand navigation menu, it doesn't matter how I get there.
And within my Azure AD tenant, I'm going to click on Users. From here, I'll get a list of existing user accounts.
Now I've got my initial Microsoft Account that reflects my Azure account that I initially set up. However, I'm going to click the New user button to build a new user. Now this user is going to be an Azure AD user, I'm not going to invite them, they are an external user. So I'm going to leave it on Create user.
And for the identity here, I'm going to specify that the username is cblackwell, so Codey Blackwell. And after the add symbol here, it's going to use my DNS domain suffix for my Azure AD tenant, so that's already filled in.
So I'm going to leave that as it is, and then scroll down and just fill in a couple of other details. So Codey Blackwell, that's the full name, and I'll just fill in the first name, the last name.
And down below because we're creating a new account, it asks whether we want to auto-generate the password, or do we want to specify it? I'm going to let it Auto-generate it. I'm just going to choose Show Password and copy it, so I can communicate that to the user.
At this time, we can also determine if the user is going to be a member of a group, and which roles they have, which gives them certain permissions. However, I'm not going to change any of that, I certainly don't want a Block sign in for this user. And I'm not going to fill in any other details. So let's go ahead and click Create to create user Codey Blackwell. And before you know it, the user shows up here in the list of Azure AD users, we're going to go ahead and test logging in as Codey Blackwell.
Now one way to do that is to connect to account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/, which I will do now.
So I'm going to specify the full email address of the new user, so cblackwell@ and then of course my Azure AD tenant DNS domain name. Now the default is that it will always end with.onmicrosoft.com unless you create custom DNS domain names, but that's the default setting. Let me go ahead and click Next, it's going to ask me for the password. So I'm going to go ahead and put in the auto-generated password that I previously copied and I'll choose Sign in.
Now, of course it wants me to change the passwords, so I'll put in the existing auto-generated password, and I will specify a new password and confirm it. And then I'll click Sign in. And when it asks me to stay signed into my web browser, I'll just choose No.
And we can now see that we are successfully signed in as user Codey Blackwell as part of the QUICK24X7 Azure AD tenant.


Azure AD Users and the CLI
Not only can you use the Azure portal to create and manage Azure AD user accounts, but you can also do this using the Azure CLI.
The CLI can also be spawned here in the Azure portal as opposed to running it on-premises, and that's how I'm going to run it. So here in the portal, I'm going to click the Cloud Shell icon at the top in the bar. And I'm going to make sure I'm in a PowerShell session which allows me to run PowerShell cmdlets as well as Azure CLI commands.
And the first thing I'm going to want to do here is, create an account in Azure AD. So to do that, I'm going to run az ad user, now there is a space between each of those words. Now if I'm not sure where to progress from here I can use the -h to get help with the next level commands.
It looks like create as opposed to add or new. And I could also use the up arrow key, to bring up the previous command and we know that creates the next level part of the syntax, okay. But what after that, I don't know what to put in. Well, we could use -h and we can learn more about the various parameters that we could specify to create the user.
So we can see arguments like display-name, password, user-principal-name, force-password-change-next-login, and so on. So this gives us enough to get started. So az ad user create --display-name and in this case, let's say I'm going to create a user whose name will be "Jen Hill" -- user-principal-name. It's going to be jhill@ and then I have to put in the DNS domain suffix for my tenant. Now if I'm not sure what that is, I can, for example, let's minimize this, click to open up my left-hand navigator menu.
Go to Azure Active Directory, there's much ways to view this, of course. And in the Overview, I'll see the entire name.
So in this case, it's quick24x7test.onmicrosoft.com. So, .onmicrosoft.com is the default DNS suffix unless you've created a custom DNS domain name for your tenant, which I haven't. Let's go back into the CLI here. I'm just going to go ahead and paste that right in there. So we're just going to right click and choose Paste. Okay, that part is in there. Next thing I want to do is, specify the passwords. So I can do that with --password and I'm going to tell that within double quotes, a specific password that I want to use. Okay, and once I've done that, I can press Enter to create the user account.
Now if I don't have a password that complies with password complexity requirements, as we can see has not been done here, then I'm going to have to come up with something different. So I'm going to use the up arrow key and specify a different password for this account. Now once I filled in that password, we can go ahead and try to see if it will accept our newly created password.
This time, we didn't get the red error message, so it looks good. And as a matter of fact, let's just minimize Cloud Shell for a second. Let's just check our work here in the GUI.
So in my Quick24x7 Azure AD tenant, if I go to the Users view, among other users that already might have been there, we'll see the newly created Jen Hill.
So let's go back into the CLI and poke around a little bit. I'm going to clear the screen. So if I were to run az ad user list, it'll list my Azure AD users, but notice what we get returned all of the properties.
And at this level, we'd have to scroll through to find exactly what we wanted to see. I don't want to have to do that, there's got to be a better way. So let me clear the screen with the clear command. I could do stuff like this. I could say az ad user list. And if you're a UNIX or a Linux shell scripting person or just a command line person, you could pipe it to the grep line filtering command and tell it what you want to see. For example, all I want to see is the mailNickname property. So only show me those lines. And sure enough, it looks like it's working.
However, you could also do some CLI-specific stuff. What I mean by that is you could run, for example, az ad user list and you could use --query. This will work with anything in the CLI to query something out. Now, the problem is, it's not a problem, but if I were to just assume I could put in the property name, mailNickname, then I would get a whole lot of nothing.
However, you may say well maybe it's case sensitive, it's not going to make a difference. So if I just put it all lowercase, still nothing.
And the reason is because if you think about the command output, it's returning more than one item. It's returning an array or a collection of users and you need to reference that before the property names. So up arrow key to bring up previous command and I'm going to put an open and close square bracket to reference the fact that we're dealing with an array. Dot, to separate the array item, the user, from the property, in this case mailnickname. And I'll go ahead and press Enter.
Now, again, if I change the n in nickname to a capital N because it is case sensitive, we can now see that it's returning the mailNickname. So there are a few things then, that we can do using the Azure CLI to work with user accounts in Azure AD.


Azure AD Users and PowerShell
You can use PowerShell cmdlets to create and manage Azure AD user accounts.
Of course, you could also use the portal, as we see here to create new users, or to click on existing users to make changes to any properties and so on. Now, here I'm going to click on Cloud Shell at the top of the bar here in my Azure Portal screen.
And I'm going to make sure I'm in PowerShell, where I can run both PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI commands.
Now I could download PowerShell locally on my computer, but I'm going to choose to use the Cloud Shell here instead. Now, the first thing I need to figure out is what might the name of the cmdlet be if I want to add a new Azure Active Directory user? So I can figure that out using get-command. For example, get-command. Maybe I'll use an asterisk. And maybe I'll put in azaduser. That's a guess, I'm assuming that would be part of the name. Otherwise I could try different variations.
But luckily this looks reasonable. I've got a New-AzADUser cmdlet as opposed to add or anything like that or create.
Well, that's good news, because now I can get help about that cmdlet now that I know what it's called. So I might run get-help and I might ask for help for the new-azaduser cmdlet, maybe even ask for details, -details. Or detail in singular rather not details. And here I can see that it's returned back the information that I wanted for this, so it gives me a brief synopsis, creates a new active directory user.
Now, that's true specifically in Azure and I get a sense of how the syntax would be used. And what's important here because there could be a lot of parameters is that it explains each and every one of them. And even more handy, as I go way down. I have some examples of how we might actually create, a new Azure Active Directory user. We can see here, they are converting a regular string for a password to a secure string using the ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet, before they actually build the new user and pass the password with the -Password priority.
You can see the variable they're using here is $SecureStringPassword.
Variables in PowerShell, are always prefixed with a dollar sign. So we have some great help here.
So let's clear the screen, let's make it happen. First thing I want to do, is make a password very long. So going to call it $pw for password. And I'm going to put in =, and I'm going to run the convertto-securestring cmdlet. And I'm going to use the -string parameter. And I'm going to specify the password that I want to use for this. Let's say it's something like this. So I'm specifying the password here within double quotation marks. It's plain text, so -asplaintext and I'm going to -force this, and I'm going to press Enter.
So if I just do $pw to see what's in that variable, it doesn't even return the actual password, that's the point, it's been converted to a secure string item, and I can pass that, to the new-azaduser cmdlet.
So I'm going to set -displayname, let's say here -displayname to a user Sharon Bishop. Creating Sharon Bishop the -userprincipalname will be determined by well first of all it's going to be determined by organizational naming conventions but in this case it's going to be sbishop@ and then the DNS name of my Azure AD tenant. And I'll just close the double quotes after that and I'll specify -password and this is where we're I'm going to pass it my variable. So $pw, which we know from above is a secure string representation of the password I specified up above.
Now it requires the MailNickname parameters. So because I did not supply it, it asks for it. Let's cancel out of that just for fun.
And I'll clear the screen. If I were to use the up arrow key to bring up the new-azaduser cmdlet, we could add the -MailNickname parameter. So -mailnickname. Let's say it's just going to be sbishop. And if I press Enter, it creates the account and doesn't ask me anything. Now that's going to be an important thing to consider mandatory parameter values when it comes to trying to automate some of these things.
Let's just check our work. First of all here, directly in the portal since we have it opened up, let's go to the users view of our Azure AD tenant. Indeed we can see Sharon Bishop has been created.
But let's go back into PowerShell for a second. Because there are some cmdlets that we can use, for example, get-azaduser to check to see what's in our Azure AD tenant.
We can see the last user here, of course, is user Sharon Bishop. Of course in PowerShell, we can start filtering out what we want to see. So for example, get-azaduser, we can pipe the result of a PowerShell command using the pipe symbol, the vertical bar symbol. Now most keyboards you can get that symbol by shifting your backslash key. I can then refer to select and tell it what I want to see. Let's say I want to see the display name property. You have to know what the properties are called comma, and the id.
So there's the display name and there's the internal Id identifier for the Azure AD user accounts. So we have the option then of using a number of PowerShell cmdlets for managing. Azure AD users, and we can take that a step further. So let's clear the screen. Remember how we ran get-command. So I'm going to use wildcards here and going to put azaduser. We used New-AzADUser and Get-AzADUser.
But if you want to make modifications to a user account, you could use Set-AzADUser. You could also remove accounts also using Remove-AzADUser. So there are a lot of options that are available. So for example, let's say we wanted to change Sharon Bishop's last name, I could use update -azaduser and I could specify the -objectId. So we're going to have to go back to a previous command to see what Sharon Bishop's ID is, there it is right there.
I'm going to go ahead and copy that to my clipboard, let's clear the screen here and let's try this, let's run update-azaduser-objectid.
And here I'll just right-click and paste Sharon Bishop's ID. And let's say I want to change the display names, so -displayname. And now I want it to be Sharon and for lack of a better choice, just so we can illustrate the example, her last name will now say changed. So Sharon Changed. And if we do that looks like, it took let's kind of use our up arrow key to go back to get-azaduser. And indeed we can see Sharon's last name is now changed.
