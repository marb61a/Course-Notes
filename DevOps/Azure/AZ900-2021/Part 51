                    Course Notes Part 51


View Azure PCI DSS Compliance (Cont)
  - Because as you see, just because we have a green bar next to something
    - In this case, install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data that comes straight from PCI DSS
    - Notice that we've got some compliance green bars here but others, not necessarily
    - So we have to take a look at those and address them
    - So we can expand upon them to read more details about what we should be doing to be fully compliant
    - As we go further down through this list how about removing the check mark for expanding all compliance controls.
  - There's no question that the grayed out items mean that we are missing some things that we should be doing to secure cardholder data
  - If we expand them, in this case for the regular use and updating of antivirus programs
    - It says that we should be deploying that solution, and we are not on all of our virtual machines
    - However if we've got something like, assign a unique ID to each person with computer access
    - If we expand that, and take a look at these subordinate items
    - While some of them do have green bars, again some do not, there are gray bars
    - So we need to read those and make the appropriate changes if we are seeking full compliance, in this case, with PCI DSS


Azure Service Level Agreements
  - Service Level Agreements or SLAs are contractual documents between a service provider and the service consumer
    - In this context, the service provider is Microsoft Azure, and in this context, the service consumer would be you as you are the Azure customer
    - So the service level agreement is important because it stipulates what we can expect for performance and uptime from a given Azure service
  - In other words, there's an SLA for each different Azure service. And it's important that we take a look at that to know what we can expect
    - Especially if we're burdened with meeting specific compliance guidelines, perhaps by certain industry standards
    - We want to make sure that we comply with those through the use of Azure Cloud Computing Services
  - Go to the Microsoft Azure Service Level Agreements page
    - You can use your favorite search engine to search this up and you'll find it in a hurry
    - Scroll down, we can see that we've got a list of all kinds of different products and categories that we can do the SLAs for
    - For example, let's say we start with the Compute category and we want to look at the SLA for Virtual Machines
    - Here we see the service level agreement for virtual machines and whether it's deployed across two or more availability zones for high availability
    - We can see here connectivity to at least one of them, 99.99% of the time
    - As we go further down through a Service Level Agreement document, you'll see that it's broken into an Introduction section
  - Then we've got a General Terms, so the terms that are used throughout the SLA document
    - Then as we go further down, we can see the SLA details for this specific service, in this case, virtual machines
    - We can also determine what kind of, in this case, a service credit we might receive 
    - If we've got less than a specific amount of service uptime that is promised through the SLA
  - That's just for virtual machines, let's say, we were to go and look at Storage
    - We are interested in looking at standard storage with storage accounts
    - We can see that we've got 99.99% uptime, and the ability to process storage requests
    - Here it also even mentions something specific to this class of Azure resource, or storage, in this case, for Cool Access Tiers.
  - Again, we can view the introductory information about this SLA, in this case, for Azure storage, just as before, we can see General Terms
    - A lot of that would be similar across SLAs but they won't always be exactly the same naturally due to the nature of the different types of cloud services
    - Then we can see the SLA details, for example, we've got references to Blob Storage Accounts, Hot Access Tier, Cool Access Tier
  - As we go further down again, we can see the processing time and the types of transactions that we can expect to get in terms of performance
    - Then if that is not met, then we can see the service credits related to the sub par performance that we might experience
    - Hopefully, you will never experience it
    - It's very important then that we keep abreast of all of these service level agreements and any changes to them for the Azure services that we are using


Azure Preview Features and General Availability
  - Azure preview features are just that
    - They're new features that Microsoft is making available for testing purposes in the Azure environment 
    - Because with Microsoft Azure there is a constant process for improvement of available cloud services
    - However, we don't want to use preview features for mission critical workloads.
  - Azure preview features can be turned on or off for the specific services that you might be interested in using the preview feature for
    - But the thing to bear in mind is that Azure preview features are excluded from Azure service level agreements or SLAs
    - So where the SLA might guarantee up time or response time, that would not apply if you are using an Azure preview feature
    - You can get notifications of Azure preview features that show up in the portal as pictured here
  - When you look at the Notification icon, the alarm bell icon, you'll see notifications for the appropriate items that have new preview features
    - Here we can see preview listed next to Templates and the Quickstart Center.
    - After Azure preview features have gone through the appropriate testing and feedback from customers has been brought into the final version of the product
    - The final version of that product or feature means it is now available generally
    - That's called general availability, often simply notated in documentation as GA
  - GA features and APIs then are covered by Azure service level agreements because its an actual feature that is supported now by Microsoft
    - It's no longer in the preview phase
    - If you're a developer, and you've taken advantage of some preview features
    - The reality is that sometimes features that were available in preview at the development level are removed 
    - Once the feature or product goes to general availability


Azure Monitoring and Service Health
  - Anyone that's worked in IT for more than a few minutes will understand how important log files are
    - Log files help us analyze any problems to quickly resolve the issue
    - They can also sometimes indicate suspicious activity and there are plenty uses of log files
    - In Azure Monitoring and Service Health, we have to consider how log files play in to this so we've got the Azure individual resource activity log
  - When you open up the properties blade, say for a virtual machine in the Azure portal
    - You'll see that you've got activity log listed where you can click on it and see just that
    - Activity related to that resource such as creation, modification of that resource
    - We can get more detail with Azure Performance Diagnostics
    - This is a Window's virtual machine extension that you can install in to an Azure virtual machine.
  - The great thing about this, is that the output from Azure Performance Diagnostics is stored in a storage account 
    - And it's left there for 30 days as a zip file that you can take a look at
    - You might wonder how does it know where to put it? 
    - When installing the Azure Performance Diagnostics Windows VM extension you are prompted to specify storage account information in which it will dump this data
  - Then we've got custom dashboards that can be built
    - Dashboards give us a quick visual way to reference potentially multiple different aspects of Azure Performance or alerts in one place
    - We can build as many custom dashboards that we might want
    - For example, someone that's responsible for the Azure compute side in the sense of virtual machines could have their own type of dashboard
    - Whereas if we're more responsible for an entire web application then we might have different items on a separate dashboard.
  - Speaking of web applications, Azure Application Insights is a big deal as it lets you monitor a web application
    - What you do is install this small package within your application software and then you need to make an Azure Application Insights resource
    - The next thing that happens is it monitors the use of the application. And this is great for determining the performance of your Azure-based web application.
  - You could even have the result of that Application Insights' data show up within a custom dashboard
    - When it comes to Azure logs, then we know we can have specific application logs and that might be monitored using your custom solution
    - Or with application insights, Diagnostic logs which might through the Azure virtual machine diagnostics extension
    - Then, of course, we've got activity logs, which is part of Azure
    - Outside of the details that occur within the specific resource, in this case a virtual machine
