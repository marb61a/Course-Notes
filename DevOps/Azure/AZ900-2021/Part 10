Azure Disk Storage
  - In the Microsoft Azure environment, virtual machine hard disks can be defined.
    - They come in the form of hard disk drives or HDDs. 
    - Or for better performance, you can have it backed by solid state drives or SSDs.
  - What we're really talking about here is Azure using a virtual hard disk or a VHD hard disk file that is used by a virtual machine
    - A virtual machine can have more than a single disk, it can have numerous data disks attached to it
    - This is considered a managed disk solution
    - This means that we can simply make a selection in the interface, or programmatically about what type of disk storage we want to use with a virtual machine.
  - This is automatically taken care of by the Azure environment
    - We don't have to worry about the underlying technical detailed configuration
    - We can choose from standard hard disk drives, or HDDs, and solid state drives
    - Or we can choose between ultra and premium SSDs
  - We can also specify the disk type, in this particular case for the operating system
    - You can also do it for data disks with options such as Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD
    - Premium gives us better disk performance or a higher disk IOPS value, where IOPS stands for Input and Output Operations Per Second.
  - In this case, more is better but what is lacking in the drop down list here is the Ultra SSD option 
    - The reason it's not there is because this is currently a preview feature in Azure
    - You have to enroll in that preview in order for that option to be available


Configure Azure Disk Storage
  - Microsoft Azure virtual machines use virtual hard disks. 
    - Each virtual machine is going to have at least one of them, and it's going to be to host the operating system files. 
    - We have the option, depending on the workload requirements running within that VM, to add additional data disks.
  - Go ahead and manually create a managed disk, and then I'm going to attach it to an Azure virtual machine.
  - To get started in the portal, click Create a resource, towards the upper left, and search for managed disk.
    - There will be an entry for Managed disks, and then click the Create button.
  - The first thing you have to do is give it a meaningful name, call this eg DataDisk1.
    - Then tie it to an existing resource group and I'm going to put it in a location or region closest to where the virtual machine is already deployed.
  - Further down you get to choose the account type, whether it's Premium, SSD, Standard SSD, or the older and slower Standard HDD for hard disk drive
    - Depending on your disk IO requirements, you might choose one or the other of these options.
  - For example, just choose Standard SSD , then I get to choose the source
    - Are we taking an existing snapshot and creating a disk from it? 
    - If I open that drop-down list, do we want to go to a storage one? 
    - We might have to have, for instance, uploaded VHD or a virtual hard disk file from on-premises to a storage account. 
    - I can just make an empty disk, which I'll choose here, select the none empty disk option.
  - I can then control the size of that virtual hard disk, leave it at the default setting for this example
    - Down at the bottom then click Create.
  - After a moment we'll have a managed disk in Azure disk that we can then work with by attaching to a virtual machine where it would be needed.
  - Go to All resources, from here I will see a number of items, including the disk I just created.
  - I just filter it, for example, for the word disk, after a moment, I might have to refresh, I'll see the DataDisk1 here that I've just created.
  - Go into a virtual machine's properties, so I'm going to click on the virtual machine's view over on the left. And let's say I pop up the Properties blade from one of my Windows virtual machines. So I'll click on that, and then I'll click on Disks in the Properties blade.
  - On the right we can see the existing OS disk, but notice that there are no data disks defined yet.
    - Notice below that we've got a button that says Add data disk, so I'm going to go ahead and click on that, and from the drop-down list I'm going to choose DataDisk1.
  - Once this is done then click Save to save the change.
  - At this point I've added another virtual hard disk to an Azure virtual machine. 
    - When I fire up that virtual machine, it will show up as another Disk device.
  - Go back to the Overview part of the Properties blade here and start the virtual machine
    - This is a Windows virtual machine, so I will RDP into it, and we'll take a look at that newly-added disk device.
  - The Remote Desktop Protocol client has been used to connect to the public IP address of my Azure Windows virtual machine. 
    - It automatically starts the server manager tools, so we can work from here by clicking File and Storage services on the left and then Disks.
  - What we're going to see is that we've got a disk here, now the partitioning is not known, because it's a brand new added disk
    - It shows up here as serial attached SCASI or SAS, S-A-S.
  - Notice the capacity, for example 1,000 gigabytes is what is need which is approximately the default size that was set in Azure. 
    - At this point we would right click, depending on the operating system version, and whether it's Linux or Windows. 
    - You would use whichever method you would normally use to initialize a file system and make that a usable disk device.


Azure Blob Storage
  - When talking BLOB's we are talking about binary large objects, hence BLOBs, specifically how they relate to Azure storage accounts.
  - BLOB storage in the Azure cloud is really used as unstructured data storage. 
    - Where we don't always have the exact same type of file that is read from and written to in the exact way, instead it's unstructured.
    - We can take snapshots of BLOB files, just like you could take a snapshot of a disk volume, and it serves as a point in time picture, so to speak, of the state of the data at that point in time. There are also different storage tiers that you can choose from.
  - So if you don't require frequent access to your BLOB objects, you might configure your Azure storage tier for your BLOB storage to use the cool storage tier. 
    - Whereas if you need frequent access to your BLOB files, instead you might then choose the hot storage tier, which is optimized for frequent access. 
    - There are a variety of BLOB types, all of which are accessible over either HTTP, or the more secure HTTPS.
  - Whether using a GUI tool, like a web browser or whether you are using PowerShell commandlets, the Azure CLI
    - Or even developer's access and BLOBs through the REST API, all of those methods use HTTP or HTTPS. 
    - The Azure BLOB hierarchy starts with the storage account. 
    - For example we have astorage account that we create called sa123, under which we can then create one or more containers. 
    - Think of these as being like folders on a disk that you use to organize all of your files.
  - Let's say we've got a BLOB container called pics for pictures, into which we upload a file called pic1.jpg, that's the actual BLOB. 
    - When we put all this together and we access it over HTTP or HTTPS
    - The url should contain our storage account name then our container and the actual name of the BLOB itself.
  - That can be a different name than, for example, what you started with on-premises before you uploaded it to your storage account
    - If that's how you're populating your storage account.
  - Block BLOBs are one type of BLOB, these are used for small and large files. And you can even upload multiple BLOBs at the exact same time.
    - This would be useful if you want to store things like pictures, office productivity documents, any type of media documents up in the cloud.
    - It's great that you can upload multiple files concurrently.
  - Another type of BLOB is a page BLOB which is generally used for large file cloud storage
    - It's designed for files that will experience random reads and random writes. 
    - A great example of this would be virtual hard disk files, or VHDs, these are the virtual hard disks that are used by Azure virtual machines. 
    - The last type of BLOB is an append BLOB. Now, this one is designed so that when we have new data, it gets added to the end of an existing BLOB.
  - This means that any existing blocks of data that currently exist in the BLOB can't be updated or deleted. 
    - Why would you want this? Well, a great example of using this would be for logging purposes.


Create a Storage Account
  - Using the Azure portal to create a new Azure storage account. As the name implies, an Azure storage account is a cloud storage location
    - When you define a new storage account, there are a number of detailed settings to consider. 
    - This can be depending on things like the type of performance wanted or the type of durability
    - Or how many replicas of data you might need replicated throughout the Azure infrastructure. 
      - In the Azure portal at the homepage and could click Storage accounts, which takes me to the storage accounts view.
  - Instead of doing that, what we could also do is click the Create a resource link over in the upper left.
  - From there, it opens up a new blade where we could search for what we want to create. 
    - If I look for storage account, we could search for it that way, or we can simply browse what's presented to us on the screen.
    - I could simply go down under the Storage category on the left and then on the right, within that, choose Storage account, which I will do.
