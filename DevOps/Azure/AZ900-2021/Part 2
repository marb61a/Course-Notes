                    Course Notes Part 2


  - We've also got network virtualization seen here in the bottom right. 
    - A term that comes to mind in line with that is software defined networking, or SDN, which is used extensively in cloud computing. 
    - Software defined networking really means that we provide cloud customers with an easy way to configure virtual network settings and routing tables etc 
    - Rather than have them actually make a connection to the underlying hardware like routers that do that, we provide an easier interface.
    - There is also desktop virtualization, where an entire user desktop might run on a centralized server that actually runs multiple user desktops concurrently. 
  - So the end user then would need a thin client device with not a lot of processing and maybe not even any local storage. 
    - They would need network access to the server that hosts the virtual desktops. 
  - The benefits of virtualization in Microsoft Azure? 
    - One is cloud tenant isolation. By allowing customers to provision their own separate virtual machines and Active Directory instances
    - Those serve sort of as security boundaries so that one tenant can't access virtual machines and Active Directory instances that are deployed by other tenants
  - Virtualization allows for the rapid provisioning of virtual machines
    - Users can simply make a selection in the Azure portal to deploy a Linux or a Windows virtual machine that perhaps has additional software 
    - It happens after just a few clicks or it can also be managed and deployed programmatically at the command line.
  - Rapid and easy provisioning of virtual machines is one of the great things about using cloud computing in Azure. 
    - A lot of the other services that are available in Azure, whether it comes to big data processing and analytics, 
    - Or whether talking about running databases of any type or talking about hosting websites, all of that depends on virtual machines
  - In some cases, some of these are called managed services, which means that we don't actually specify the virtual machine deployment details, 
    - For example when deploying a SQL Server database in the cloud we can just focus on the database side and Azure takes care of the virtualization for us.


Cloud Computing and Economies of Scale
  - The economies of scale work great wonders in the Cloud. 
  - One of the reasons is because all of these pooled resources like storage erase, physical hypervisors that run virtual machines,
    - Network equipment like routers and switches, and even inter-data center network links for Azure, all of these are done on a very large scale. 
    - This is the responsibility of Microsoft in the Azure data centers
  - One of the great things about economies of scale is that things are cheaper in bulk
    - This can be examined from a couple of different perspectives, one being from Microsoft's. 
    - Purchasing a large amount of physical rack mount servers is going to end up being cheaper than buying one or two, especially over time. 
    - If you are a repeat customer, buy equipment from that hardware vendor.
  - At the same time because we've got numerous cloud tenants, in other words Microsoft Azure customers, and this is on a very large scale
    - This means that Microsoft can afford to charge what they are charging for any fees in Azure because of the large volumes that they're dealing with
    - Cloud tenants or customers for Microsoft Azure will pay a monthly subscription cost
    - Depending on the cloud service, there may be additional usage fees on top of that, such as charging for the amount of time that virtual machines are running.
  - Another consideration is that with an on-premises IT environment, the organization is responsible for all upfront costs of setting up the network infrastructure
    - This covers buying storage arrays and backup systems and servers, and so on
    - This is a capital expenditure, otherwise called Capex.
  - Looking at cloud computing, all of that stuff just described at the hardware level is not the responsibility of the cloud customer
    - It is the responsibility of the cloud provider, in this case, Microsoft Azure. 
    - This means as a Cloud customer that is using Microsoft Azure services, we have an ongoing operating expenditure on a monthly basis 
    - This is to pay for our usage of Cloud services and that's called Opex.
  - So with Cloud economies of scale, providers are able to allow Cloud customers to pay small fees for using services 
    - These otherwise might not even be possible for smaller organizations on premises


Public Clouds
  - Public clouds share a lot of the same characteristics that other cloud types do
  - With the public cloud, one characteristic is broad access. 
    - In this context, we're talking about having access to cloud services over a network, in this case, the Internet. 
    - Resource pooling means that the underlying hardware infrastructure, so the network configuration, rough routers and switches
    - It also covers things like storage arrays, physical storage, hypervisor service that run virtual machines. 
    - All of this is pooled together and made available to be provisioned by Microsoft Azure customers.
  - The rapid elasticity side really reflects how quickly and easy it is to provision these cloud resources such as virtual machines or a new storage account. 
    - It can be done in moments, using a variety of different methods. 
    - Self-provisioning refers to the fact that the cloud customer is the one that provisions resources. 
    - For instance, if we want to deploy a new Linux virtual machine in Microsoft Azure, we don't need to contact a Microsoft Azure technician to do that 
    - We do it ourselves, and we're going to learn about all the different ways that that can be done.
  - Metered usage reflects the fact that we are charged based on what we are using in Microsoft Azure. 
    - The more data that you have stored and the more often it's accessed, the more it will cost. 
    - The more virtual machines you have deployed in Azure and the longer they're kept running, the more you will be charged.
  - Public clouds are available to anybody that has access to the Internet. 
    - In order to work with Microsoft Azure, there is a need to create an account. 
    - Bear in mind however that with the public cloud computing environment, the cloud provider owns the underlying IT infrastructure.
  - When it comes to cloud resource management eg working with things like Azure Virtual Machines, or web applications running in Azure or databases
    - Those are resources, they can be managed using a web browser interface, that would be the Azure Portal
  - GUI tools can, such as those that are available from Microsoft, like the Storage Explorer tool. 
    - This is just another way to reach out to your cloud subscription and work with things like storage accounts
    - We can use command line tools to manage Azure resources.
  - We'll be learning about how to use PowerShell cmdlets to do that as well as how to use the Azure CLI. 
    - Developers will be interested in hooking into exposed APIs, Application Programming Interfaces
    - These allow developers to work with cloud services at a programmatic level
    - For example, if there is a component of an application running on premises, you can reach out to the cloud and talk to cloud services programmatically.
  - With public clouds, the responsibility for the IT configuration and ongoing management could be split between the cloud provider and the cloud customer 
    - This will be depending on the specific service being used. 
    - An example is if we are deploying a Linux virtual machine manually in the Azure cloud
    - Then we are the ones that are responsible for applying updates to that virtualized Linux operating system. 
    - It will also be up to us to determine how that virtual machine is configured and what software is installed within it. 
    - At the same time however if we look at the underlying physical hypervisor server that runs virtual machines
    - That would be the responsibility of Microsoft in Azure data centers to make sure that hardware's kept up and running and kept patched at the firmware level
  - The other thing to bear in mind in Azure is some cloud service offerings. 
    - An example of this might be a certain type of virtual machine size that determines the horsepower of that virtual machine
    - Some of those, as well as other services, might only be available in some Azure geographical regions and not others.


Private Clouds
  - Another type of cloud is a private cloud. It shares the same characteristics as other types of clouds, however from a different perspective
  - One of the cloud characteristics we have to consider is broad access. 
    - In the case of a private cloud, we're talking about access to cloud services over a network. 
    - In this case however, the network is limited in scope and it is not accessible by all users over the Internet that want to sign up with an account. 
    - That's a public cloud whereas a private cloud instead, uses equipment that is owned by and used by only a private organization.
  - So the resource pooling really boils down to being the underlying hardware infrastructure owned by the organization. 
    - Whether it's on a small scale, such as a very tiny private cloud defined on perhaps a couple of rack mount servers in a small server closet 
    - Up to a larger enterprise that has offices in different countries that has its own data centers and again with its own private cloud services available.
  - Yet another characteristic of a cloud is rapid elasticity, which would allow, in this case, only people within the organization to use private cloud services. 
    - Self-provisioning means that the users of cloud services can provision or de-provision cloud resources at will. 
    - An example is if you're a department manager within an organization using a private cloud 
    - If you decide you need another virtual machine to support business processes used by your department, then you might access some kind of a web portal. 
    - Maybe there exits an automated template that's been prepared to be used in this context to quickly deploy that type of virtual machine.
  - Finally, metered usage means that all of the usage of private cloud resources are being tracked. 
    - They might wonder why is that within a single organization. 
    - Within a single organization, we might charge how many cloud resources in our private cloud are being consumed by various departments within the company
    - Then we might track that and on a monthly or quarterly basis, we might charge back the cost of those resources that were consumed back to that department 
  - If I have a cloud then, we'll use virtualization, because that is one of the aspects of cloud computing. 
    - Remember however that just because virtualization is used on-premises, it doesn't mean that we have a private cloud. 
    - For example if you have a Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor on-premises running on a server and from it running a bunch of virtual machines. 
    - Or even maybe you're using VMware ESXi hosts, and you've got a couple of virtual machines running. 
    - Do we have a cloud? No, we do not because if we go back here, 
    - This is because we can see that these are the characteristics that must be met in order to say that we have a cloud. 
    - It's not just virtualization, which really falls under resource pooling, but also these other characteristics.
  - With a private cloud we know now that the organization owns the IT infrastructure and whatever cloud services that are deemed should be available
    - Not to anyone over the Internet that wants to subscribe. 
    - From a responsibility standpoint, this means that all of the IT responsibility
    - Beginning with determining what kind of hardware we need and acquiring it
      - And then applying firmware updates and installing operating systems, installing software, getting licenses,
      - Configuring software, troubleshooting and updating software
      - All of that falls under the responsibility of the organization that owns the private cloud.
      - Departmental chargeback falls under the cloud characteristic of metered usage.
