Common Cloud Vulnerabilities
  - One important aspect of properly using cloud computing is thinking about common cloud vulnerabilities
    - Many of which are no different than what you would experience on-premises
    - It all boils down to how you configure and use these services
    - Start by talking about data assets, such as databases or files containing sensitive information
    - One problem is not encrypting that information as often, encryption is automatically put in place over the network such as through HTTPS communications
  - What's less common is enforcing encryption for everything that gets stored, at least everything that is considered sensitive
    - Many public cloud providers will automatically encrypt content stored in the cloud
    - Otherwise, it's always an option for the cloud customer if it's not turned on automatically
    - Also customers will always have the ability to use their own custom encryption keys that are in their control for their cloud data that's encrypted
    - The other possible issue related to data assets is more on the administrative side
    - Where a data asset is important, also cloud resources are important such as cloud virtual machines running a mission critical app.
  - So the principle of least privilege, or PoLP, states that only the permissions required to perform a job task should be granted and nothing more
    -The principle at least privilege abuse could be a problem where we might simply grant too many permissions to cloud resources
    - Such as to other administrators and therefore they might mistakenly delete virtual machines that are critical
    - Ordeploy too many of them and not shut them down, which means the organization is paying for those unnecessarily
    - What can be done then is to use role-based access control or RBAC.
  - In other words, if you need someone to be able to manage your virtual machine in the cloud
    - But not actually getting to the data within it, we could use a role, that would allow them to manage the virtual machine
    - That would then take care of that problem as they wouldn't have any additional permission
    - So RBAC is an important consideration when it comes to security in cloud computing
    - Then there's users and devices, for example instead of going with just username and password
    - Which constitutes single factor authentication, because it's both something you know, you might use multi-factor authentication for all cloud user accounts.
  - Now, multi-factor authentication uses another authentication factor, such as requiring the possession of a smartphone, where a six digit PIN might be sent
    - That must be used in addition to a username and password to authenticate, so something you know, plus something you have
    - The other thing is to harden all user devices
    - All it takes is a single compromised smartphone that has access to cloud resources to start a security breach or some kind of a malware infection in the cloud.
  - Always remember that every endpoint device, whether it be a smartphone, a tablet, an industry specific device connected to the cloud
    - All of these items need to be secured to reduce their attack surface
    - Then there's the insider abuse where there is the potential for staff or cloud administrators to damage or exfiltrate information
    - One of the things that we can apply in a cloud computing environment is data loss prevention policies, otherwise called DLP policies.
  - Data loss prevention, has rules that looks at the type of information or data being worked with
    - If it, for example, determines that maybe there's credit card numbers in it
    - It can automatically encrypt and prevent forwarding of that information through email, as just one example
    - Of course, auditing as auditing allows for accountability
    - We can track not only user activity, but also device activity that might be abnormal
    - Such as devices authenticating to a VPN in the middle of the night when that normally does not happen
    - Many public cloud service providers have mechanisms in place to automatically detect things like this, suspicious login activity.


Azure Virtual Machines
  - One of the great things about deploying virtual machines in the Azure cloud is how easy and rapidly those virtual machines can be provisioned.
  - Whether using command line tools or the Azure portal, you can deploy Windows and Linux virtual machines in the Azure cloud
    - The usage fees that we are charged for that is based on a couple of items, such as the virtual machine size
    - Which really determines the horsepower that virtual machine has when it's running.
  - Speaking of when a virtual machine is running, you are also charged for the amount of time virtual machines are left running
    - When you don't need them to be running, perhaps if you're testing something
      - Make sure to shut down virtual machines, and you might even delete the virtual machine if you no longer need it
      - There are a lot of factors to consider when you deploy and manage virtual machines in Azure.
  - The VM size, which consists of things like the number of virtual CPUs, the amount of RAM, and the disk IOPS, the input/output operations per second
    - More of these items is better for performance but, of course, you're going to be paying more
    - You might need more of RAM or more vCPUs to support the workload running within the VM.
  - When you deploy a VM, you deploy it into an Azure region or location
    - You should consider this because you might want to deploy it in a region that is geographically close to the user base that will require access to that vm
    - Azure Virtual Machines have an operating system disk
    - But you can create separate independent managed disks that you can then attach to virtual machines or detach as needed
    - They show up as data disks within the virtual machine operating system.
  - In the virtual machine operating system, you still have to treat it as a new disk and initialize a partition and format it
    - Virtual machines can also have extensions, these are like little software agents that run within the VM operating system
    - You might do this for the purposes of things like security
    - You might want some kind of anti-malware scanner running as an extension within your VM, or a backup agent
    - Or even script support agents, such as for PowerShell desired state configuration.
  - When you deploy your Azure Virtual Machine, be it Windows or Linux, consider the Azure virtual network and subnet into which you are deploying it
    - Which also means that we have to think about the IP addressing that will be assumed from a subnet
    - Or whether or not you need a public IP address for a virtual machine if you need to access it from the outside, such as from an on-premises network.
  - The thing to consider is, let's say that you're going to deploy five virtual machines into the same Azure virtual subnet
    - Instead of assigning five public IP addresses to each of them, you might consider assigning only one, which gives you a way in
    - Once you're in, then you connect to the private IP addresses of the other four virtual machines
    - With Azure Windows Virtual Machines, we need to specify the logon credentials.
  - In other words, the username and the password that we'll use when we authenticate to it using Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP
    - You need to ensure that any firewalls between a client device trying to connect to your Azure Windows Virtual Machine and it allows RDP traffic over port 3389
    - You can also, when you are deploying or creating a new virtual machine, add it to an availability set
    - Availability sets group virtual machines together for high availability.
  - However, the virtual machines in the set don't have to be exactly the same
    - You can only do that when you are creating the virtual machine added to an availability set
    - You should also consider your backup strategy for your Azure virtual machine
    - Whether you're going to have extensions in the VM that support backup
    - Or whether you're going to be using some kind of a backup vault
  - Azure Linux Virtual Machines can use either username and password authentication or public key authentication, where you don't have to use the password
    - However, you have to have a public and a private key pair, where the public key is defined with the Azure Linux Virtual Machine
    - You would keep the private key, for example, with your on-premises station
    - We can connect using Secure Shell, or SSH, over port 22, and so your firewalls have to allow SSH traffic for this to work.
  - Just like when working with Windows Azure Virtual Machines, when we deploy a Linux virtual machine at that time
    - We can also add it to an availability set a virtual machine availability set for high availability
    - We should also consider our backup strategy, whether it's an extension
    - Or whether we have a script running within the virtual machine, or whether we're going to use some kind of a recovery services vault backup solution
    - When you deploy a manual virtual machine in Azure, meaning it's Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS,
    - It means that you have full configuration control of that virtual machine and the operating system and software running within it
    - Which means that you are responsible for updating those things. However, there's also the notion of managed VMs
    - This means that virtual machines in some cases can be deployed automatically for you depending on the service you choose
    - Like when you deploy a higher level service like Azure SQL Database
    - As such, you have limited configuration control for managed virtual machines, to work with virtual machines in Azure, we can use the Azure Portal
  - There's also Azure PowerShell commandlets, the Azure CLI
    - An ARM template can be used, where you define one or more virtual machines, even other types of resources
    - That can be deployed and managed through the ARM template
    - And the ARM template can be itself deployed through the Portal or through PowerShell or the CLI
    - Developers can also use client SDKs and REST APIs to programatically talk to Azure resources like virtual machines.
