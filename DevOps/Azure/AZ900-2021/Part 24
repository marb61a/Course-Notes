Hybrid Cloud
  - A Hybrid Cloud computing model, combines both private and public clouds
    - Where a private cloud refers to private infrastructure owned and used by a single organization
    - That follows cloud computing characteristics, such as metered usage, self-provisioning and so on, as well as using public cloud provider solutions
    - But a hybrid cloud can also mean that you are linking your on-premises IT infrastructure with the public cloud
    - Examples of this would include, using a site-to-site VPN, between your on-premises network and the cloud.
  - Essentially, extending your on-premises network environment into the cloud environment 
    - Or even linking your on-premises identity store like Microsoft Active Directory with Active Directory in the cloud
    - To allow users to sign-in once with their on-premises credentials, yet still be authorized to use cloud apps
    - There are a number of variations then on what a hybrid cloud is
    - In the public cloud, you might use this, so you could work with services, that don't deal with sensitive data
    - You also want the benefits of scalability in the public cloud, whereby you might use the private cloud to store more sensitive data
    - However, that's not to say in any way that storing anything in the cloud is less secure than storing it on-premises.
  - We can use a hybrid cloud environment for big data operations
    - Big data refers to the vast amounts of data, even from streaming over the network, over the Internet
    - Such as data coming in from news feeds, data coming in from IoT devices, it could be coming from anywhere
    - But when we have vast amounts of data, it makes sense that we have a scalable environment to analyze that data
    - And an easy and cheap way to do that is in the public cloud, but that's public cloud.
  - What's the take on hybrid? Well, the hybrid kicks in, because you might have some of those data feeds sourced from your on-premises network
    - Or perhaps your analysis tools are on-premises, but you want big data stored in the cloud
    - Another use case would be, cloud backup and replication
    - For instance, you might install an agent on your on-premises servers or even devices
    - It doesn't have to be a server that periodically on a schedule backs data up to the cloud environment, the public cloud
    - So you've got a link between your on-premises environment and the cloud in terms of backup, even replication.
  - So not only backups, but you might have live replica data, replicated from an on-premises file server into the cloud
    - And whether content is changed in the cloud or on-premises, it synchronizes to the other location
    - You might use a hybrid solution for the short term because you are adopting cloud computing
    - You want to migrate some of your on-premises components into the cloud, such as data, or applications, or virtual machines, that type of thing
    - The other thing to think about with the hybrid cloud is that, at least on the public cloud computing side, you're only paying for resources that are used.
  - You should therefore always avoid idle cloud resources, especially things like databases that you deploy in the cloud as a managed service
    - Meaning you don't have to worry with the underlying servers to get that up and running
    - Don't leave those things running because you will incur charges, only leave them running if they need to be left running.


Community Cloud
  - A community cloud, is used amongst organizations that have similar IT needs
    - Such as similar underlying compute requirements, perhaps for graphics processing
    - Similar storage requirements, such as within national boundaries
    - Similar security requirements, such as the protection of sensitive data, using very specific tools and methods, and also scalability
    - In essence, a community cloud is cloud computing, but it's kind of a subset of it where it's a little bit more specialized and caters to more specific needs
    - Community cloud characteristics include a shared infrastructure though this is true with all cloud computing models except for private.
  - Understand that the organizations or entities that might have similar computing needs, could be both in the private sector and/or at the government level
    - Some public cloud service providers, offer government cloud solutions.
    - When should an organization use the community cloud solution
    - Well, you probably have to, if it's a government agency that must meet very strict security requirements
    - For regulatory compliance related to processing, storing, and collecting things like health information, financial records, legal documents
    - It's common then to see in the healthcare industry, for example, community clouds being used that meet the specific security 
    - And operational requirements, of that type of industry.


Cloud Migration Risks and Benefits
  - Organizations that assess moving to the cloud, need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing along with the risks to determine which action should be taken
    - One of the benefits of migrating to the cloud is reduced capital costs
    - In the public cloud computing environment, we are using the cloud service provider's underlying infrastructure
    - Their physical servers, their storage arrays, their network equipment
    - Which means that we as the customer, do not have to put up the money upfront to acquire that hardware infrastructure, hence, reduced capital costs.
  - On-demand scalability is a benefit of the cloud
    - If we determine that we need more power in a virtual machine, we can resize it with a click of a button, and add more RAM or virtual CPUs
    - If we need more storage space, we can do that quickly
    - If we need to have more virtual machines running in a cluster to support an app, to improve performance
    - We can do that very quickly and easily without any underlying technical knowledge
    - On demand scalability, is a very important benefit related to cloud computing.
  - Disaster recovery, many organizations actually use the public cloud as an alternate recovery site
    - This takes proactive planning ahead of time, meaning that you might replicate virtual machines which run applications 
    - And data to alternate geographical locations, essentially, to other data centers owned by the cloud service provider
    - So that in the event of a regional disaster, for example, you've already got your systems and your data running elsewhere
    - That can minimize business disruptions, remote access to applications
    - When you're running things in the cloud, then you can access them from anywhere.
  - Of course, we have security rules that are in place to limit traffic flow
    - But the potential is there to allow that to happen
    - Depending on the specific type of migration scenario you're talking about
    - You could result with less administrative responsibility
    - For example, imagine that you are moving from an on-premises mail server that your IT team must maintain, where all the user mailboxes are stored
    - If for example you're moving from that, to a cloud hosted email solution then you don't have to worry about the server anymore.
  - You can just add users and licenses with a click of a button
    - That means then in that particular example that you don't have to worry about updating the mail server software 
    - Or the underlying operating system running the mail server
    - That would then become the responsibility, of the cloud service provider which is definitely a perceived benefit
    - But there's no gain without some kind of undertaken risk, one of which is proprietary technologies
    - If a cloud service provider is offering their services or data exchange formats over the network 
    - And with files in a very specific format, that could make it difficult to get your data out of that cloud
    - Back either on premises or to a different cloud provider.
  - Then there's network latency and downtime of services, which are potential risks
    - However, remember that public cloud service providers have a service level agreement that guarantees uptime on a monthly basis
    - So usually the risk is more prevalent on the customer side
    - Meaning that if we only have a single Internet connection, linking an on premises office to the cloud and we depend on the cloud
    - Then we should probably consider having a secondary Internet connection to the cloud from a different Internet service provider 
    - To increase resiliency against failure.
  - The other thing to think about is data sensitivity
    - You might have certain laws or regulations that require data to be collected, processed, stored, shared, and archived in a very specific way
    - In order to comply with these laws and regulations, it would be upon you, the cloud customer
    - To configure settings appropriately, to meet those data sensitivity requirements.
