                    Course Notes Part 8


Navigate the Azure Portal (Cont)
  - On the topic of Azure Active Directory, which serves as a storage location for additional users and groups
    - We can switch between multiple Azure Active Directory instances if we have them. 
    - In the upper right where my user account name is, it says DEFAULT DIRECTORY
    - If I click on that I can switch to another Azure Active Directory instance
    - This is kind of like having multiple Active Directory domains in a larger network. 
  - You might do that for different business units, one might be for testing and development, while the other is for production.
    - When I click another existing Azure Active Directory instance, it switches me to it in the portal
    - For example, if I were to go to Azure Active Directory now and click on Users
      - I have a different listing of users that I did previously, because now I'm in a different named Azure Active Directory instance. 
  - Click on the Virtual machines view, notice here that we don't see anything. 
    - This is because we are tied to a different Azure Active Directory instance
    - Go back to the default directory where we began working
    - Again, if I go back and look at Virtual machines, there they are. 
  - So we have a couple of things that are important here in terms of navigating through the Azure portal. 
    - In the left-hand navigator, hide the text labels once I begin getting used to what these icons mean
    - For example, the plus sign naturally means I want to create some kind of an Azure resource
    - There are a number of categories here so if I want databases, I can see Databases, and I can always search for something
    - If I'm interested in Ubuntu Linux, I could search for ubuntu. 
  - We also have couple of buttons across the top that we should be aware of. 
    - The first here looks like a command prompt icon, and when I hover it, it says Cloud Shell. 
    - Cloud Shell allows me to run either CLI commands or PowerShell commands right here through the Azure portal
    - This is without having to download and install the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell files
  - Well, it wants to tie it to my subscription, I'm just going to go ahead and click Create storage, so we can see how this works. 
    - We should have now got some storage that was created for Azure Cloud Shell, and this says, it's initializing our account for use with Cloud Shell. 
    - And after a moment I'm in an Azure Cloud Shell prompt. 
    - If I simply type az, which we normally do for the Azure CLI, just like we would if we downloaded and installed the Azure CLI on our on-premises station. 
    - The difference is we're already authenticated here, and we've got all of the options available for that. 
  - In the future, so let's go ahead and close the Azure Cloud Shell
    - In the future when we run the Azure Cloud Shell, it's not going to have to set up our storage or anything like that
    - Because we've already done it the first time so when I click on it we can then determine whether we want to run PowerShell
      - Or whether we want to go into a more Linuxy environment through Bash. 
      - If I click Confirm, it will switch over and do just that
  - We can either work in a Bash type of environment if we're used to Unix and Linux, or we can work in a PowerShell more Windows-based type of environment
    - We can switch back and forth as you can see just by clicking that little icon. 
  - The other thing to bear in mind here is that we can also filter based on our subscriptions and our directories. 
  - We've got a couple of Azure Active Directory instances so we can determine how that appears here in the Azure portal
  - The alarm bell is for any notifications in this session, such as the creation or the deletion of an Azure resource. 
    - There are also some graphical configuration settings for the portal
    - Sme timeout items, such as logging out when there's a period of time for inactivity
    - We can click on our account name over here and sign out, or as we know, switch to a different Azure Active Directory instance.
  - When you're looking at a view for example the Virtual machines view
    - Bear in mind that you can also edit the columns here at the top
    - When you do that, you can determine what you want to see. 
    - The selected volumes are listed on the right, what's available to you is listed on the left. 
    - If I'm interested in Tags, let's say, because I've tagged my resources, I can select that column and move it over to the Selected columns area on the right
  - When applied the tags will be here. 
    - Here I have an easy way to edit, to make a change to any tags, here we can see it's ProjectB, and so on
  - Notice the filtering that is available here, if I only want to see virtual machines that have Linux in the name
    - I can just type in Linux and it's only showing me that. 
    - Filter can be done on other things like tagging
    - I open up tagging here maybe I only want to see stuff related to ProjectA. 
      - When I do that and close the drop-down, it filters it and shows me only that
      - I can see here that if I hover over the tags item for that virtual machine, indeed it is set to ProjectA.
  - It's important to spend a bit of time to get used to the Azure portal
    - If you're going to be working in the GUI, this is going to be your home as it relates to Azure resource management.


Azure CLI
  - The Microsoft Azure CLI is a command line interface tool. It lets you manage Microsoft Azure resources from a command line environment.
  - You could also launch this through the Azure Cloud Shell. 
    - In other words, when you're authenticated to the Azure portal, the GUI, you can launch Azure Cloud Shell and gain access to the CLI
    - You could download and install it on one of your machines on-premises
    - These can be running Windows be running Linux or be running the MacOS
    - Within any of these operating systems you can then issue Azure CLI commands if you know the syntax.
  - Now the syntax, once it's installed, begins with az followed by a hierarchy or a subset of commands
    - For example one of the first things you should know is how to retrieve the version of the Azure CLI
    - If you are looking at an example on the Internet on how to do something in the CLI and you've got a CLI installation that's a year or two old
    - What you see on the Internet might be newer and it might not be available in your installed version
    - We can run az --version, so we know what version of the CLI we're running.
  - Learn about the syntax with az --help, where we might notice that there's a vm command
    - We can get further help on that, because it is a hierarchy, by typing in az vm --help
    - Then we're going to get a help screen showing us what we can do with Azure virtual machines through the CLI.
  - An important command is az login
    - This allows you to authenticate to your Azure account so you can actually start managing your subscription and the resources within it. 
    - When you issue the az login command you're going to see a screen
    - This is where there's a note about having launched a web browser where you'll have to sign into your Azure account if you're not already signed in. 
    - Then after you sign in, you'll see the clear text listed down below here beginning with cloudName. 
    - It returns information about your specific Azure account. 
  - Now at this point, you will be authenticated and you can actually start to do things like deploy virtual machines either manually or through an ARM template
    - Or work with storage accounts or databases, websites, work with user accounts, and groups and permissions in Azure.
    - The sky is the limit but you'll be able to find out about the syntax by using az --help.


Install and Configure the Azure CLI
  - The Azure CLI, or command line interface, allows us to manage Azure resources at the command line level
    - We can run this using Azure Cloud Shell which is accessible through the Azure portal
  - Go to the documentation related to installing the Azure CLI.
    - We can see here there are instructions detailing how this is done for the Windows platform, the macOS, and Linux variants. 
    - This is going to be done this in Windows. So I'm going to choose Install on Windows. 
    - Choose Download the MSI installer andnd after a moment we can see that the Azure CLI is in the midst of downloading.
  - Once the CLI is downloaded we can go ahead and run the installation. 
    - Go ahead and accept the terms in the license agreement and I'm going to choose Install. And after a moment we'll click Finish to complete the installation. 
  - Now on that same station, I can go to a command prompt where I can begin by typing az. 
    - What's happening here is we're testing that the Azure CLI has been installed. 
    - This is the prefix that starts all of the other hierarchical commands that follow az.
