                    Course Notes Part 1


The Cloud Defined
  - Cloud computing is very similar to traditional on-premises computing
  - It's a lot of the same technologies just being used in a bit of a different way.
  - One of the factors to think about when we compare cloud computing with on-premises computing is availability. 
    - For example, imagine that you depend solely on services running out in the Microsoft Azure cloud, 
    - There is only a single Internet connection from your office so if that link goes down, we lose access to everything. 
    - All the systems, all the data that we've provisioned in the cloud, where if that was solely on-premises, we would still have access to it. 
    - The solution, of course, is to have redundant network connections to the cloud provider environment.
  - When it comes to software and licensing and hardware, with an on-premises network, that is all the responsibility of the private organization. 
    - Acquiring hardware and software and licensing the software, configuring the hardware and software, and maintaining it over time. 
    - Whereas in the Microsoft Azure cloud computing environment, that is the responsibility of Microsoft.
  - Then we have to think about the IT systems that we run in the cloud. 
    - Well when it comes to the underlying infrastructure, that is the responsibility of Microsoft. 
    - But it would be the responsibility of us as a cloud customer to deploy things like virtual machines on that infrastructure. 
    - The data that results from the use of cloud services primarily falls under the responsibility of the cloud consumer
      - This is in terms of determining whether they want that data encrypted and where it is stored.
      - Although, there is a service level agreement, or SLA, that stipulates, in the case of Microsoft Cloud Storage with Azure, 
        - that there was a certain amount of guaranteed uptime.
  - Cloud computing could be definesd as computing services that are made available over a network such as the Internet. 
    - There may be a question, isn't cloud computing only available over the Internet? 
    - The answer is no, because you could have a private cloud on-premises owned solely and used only by a single organization. 
    - So in that case, it wouldn't be accessible over the Internet.
  - Cloud computing shares a number of characteristics, one of which is resource pooling. 
    - What this means is that the cloud provider pools together infrastructure like storage that is made available to cloud customers,
    - Physical servers that run hypervisors that allow virtual machines to run, and all of the networking that allows that to communicate with one another. 
    - All of that is pooled together on a large scale and made available to cloud customers.
  - Rapid elasticity takes advantage of that resource pooling to allow cloud customers to implement or provision resources on a moment's notice. 
    - Such as requiring more storage or wanting to fire up a virtual machine in the cloud to test something at a moment's notice.
  - Metered usage means that with cloud computing, the amount that you use something, how long a virtual machine is running
    - Or how much cloud storage space being consumed, all of this is tracked kind of like a utility, like power or electricity, and so you pay for what you use. 
    - The more virtual machines running in Azure and the longer they are running the more you pay than if you had fewer running for a less amount of time.
  - Broad access means allowing access over a network. 
    - In the case of Microsoft Azure, which is really a public cloud computing solution
    - The broad access applies to everybody over the Internet that wants to sign up with an account.
  - Self-provisioning is another cloud computing characteristic, whereby cloud customers can provision and manage and also deprovision cloud resources eg storage 
    - Like cloud hosted websites or cloud hosted virtual machines. All of that should be provisionable by the end user. 
    - It is often done through an easy to use graphical web interface, although it can also be done programmatically if available.
  - The other thing to consider is whether or not we've got cloud services available that actually meet our business needs. 
    - Choosing the appropriate infrastructure like virtual machine types that will support workloads that we need to run to support business processes.
  - It also needs to be considered whether we're going to be migrating systems that we currently run on-premises such as a website
    - For example, or data that we want to migrate to the cloud. 
    - Either we want to run that in parallel while we adopt cloud computing 
    - Another case is just wanting to use the cloud as an alternate storage location to run these systems and to store data.
  - The technical expertise of IT staff needs to be considered to make sure that they understand our chosen cloud platform, such as Microsoft Azure 
    - This includes the service offerings that are available. 
    - It should be born in mind that this is a moving target, because Microsoft is constantly changing how things work in Azure. 
    - The interface, new cmdlets available in PowerShell, and so on so technical expertise is an ongoing type of task as it relates to Microsoft Azure.
  - Another item to consider is the total cost of ownership or the TCO overtime of using cloud computing. 
    - It is not necessarily true to say that cloud computing is always cheaper than just doing everything on-premises. 
    - Certainly, there are no up-front costs with cloud computing as there would be if you did the equivalent on-premises where you had to acquire hardware etc 
    - Bear in mind that this is an ongoing type of operating expense based on our usage. 
    - It is important that we track our usage of cloud resources in Azure to make sure that we're only using what we need to, to minimize costs.
  - The other consideration with cloud computing is data privacy laws and regulations. 
    - We have to think about which ones apply to our specific industry 
    - It should be determined whether or not data of certain types is allowed to be stored in the cloud in certain data centers in certain regions around the planet
  - There are plenty of benefits when adopting cloud computing, one of which is there is no up-front capital expenditure. 
    - Imagine having to buy 20 or 30 physical servers at the same time to handle business workloads
    - This is versus simply deploying virtual machines in the cloud to do the same thing? 
    - This is under the assumption that we are compliant with laws and regulations and that it makes sense to run those business processes in the cloud.
  - We also have to consider the accreditations that various cloud providers acquire. 
    - Normally they will do this so that their customers have confidence in the security of their facilities and how things are managed and secured.
  - When deploying something in the cloud, it often can be done very quickly. 
    - It really depends on the expertise of who's deploying it. 
    - Certainly more quickly than us acquiring hardware on-premises and then acquiring software and installing and configuring everything. 
    - Deploying a database or a cloud hosted website can be done in moments. 
  - Another great thing about the cloud is that the underlying technical complexities are hidden. 
    - There is usually some kind of a graphical frontend interface or programmatic access to cloud services
    - These often hide the true underlying complexities of the hardware used to support that infrastructure.
  - Finally, when we use cloud computing services ends up meaning that we are using less on-premises space
    - There is less power draw and also less requirements for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning 


Virtualization and the Cloud
  - In the IT world, virtualization and cloud computing are not synonymous, they're not the same thing. 
  - So in other words, in order to have a cloud computing environment, you need to be using virtualization. 
    - So yes, cloud computing does depend on virtualization, but the opposite is not true. 
    - In other words, if you are using virtualization. Let's say you've got a hypervisor that supports running multiple virtual machine guests concurrently. 
      - That doesn't mean that you are using cloud computing, at least, not unto itself.
  - Hypervisors can be an important part of cloud computing. 
    - Think about in the cloud, where we can quickly deploy virtual machines on the Microsoft Azure platform. 
      - Well there needs to be underlying physical server hardware that allows those virtual machines to be deployed and to run. And so those are called hypervisors.
  - So we have physical hardware running a virtualization type of operating system, that's the hypervisor. 
    - There are two main types, Type 1 and Type 2. 
    - Where the hypervisor hosts virtual machines, otherwise called guests, a Type 1 is a bare-metal hypervisor. 
    - That means that it is the operating system that runs right on the physical hardware that supports operating system virtualization.
  - Compare that with the Type 2 hypervisor, this type of hypervisor is an app. 
    - It's a piece of software that needs to be installed within an existing operating system like Linux, Windows or the Mac OS. 
    - Running a Type 1, or bare-metal hypervisor provides more options and better performance than a Type 2 hypervisor does. 
  - There are a number of different types of virtualization. 
    - We've just talked about operating system virtualization, where we could deploy a Linux or a virtual machine running Windows in the Azure cloud. 
    - It only takes a few moments to do that, and it runs on physical Type 1 hypervisor hardware. 
    - Specifically, in Microsoft Azure, it's running on Microsoft Hyper-V.
  - There are other types of virtualization like application virtualization. 
    - Application virtualization means that while we can run a specific app on a device, that app is not actually installed on that device. 
    - There is a virtualized environment, where for example a Windows virtualized app, registry entries  file system files are not written to the real host. 
    - Instead, they're in this virtualized environment whereby the app appears to be running and is running in the operating system. 
    - But it's just not been installed in it and so the benefit of this is portability
    - This is not a container it sounds like container technology but application virtualization unto itself isn't. 
    - It actually predates or precedes things like Docker containers.
