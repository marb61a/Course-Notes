Hybrid Clouds
  - Like public and private cloud computing, a hybrid cloud shares the same types of cloud characteristics, one of which is broad access. 
    - In the context of a hybrid cloud, we're really talking about using IT systems or services on-premises and in the cloud 
    - Or combining cloud types like public and private
    - The broad access will vary depending on what type of a hybrid cloud we're talking about
    - Generally speaking, broad access means allowing access IT services that are available in the cloud, over a network.
  - The resource pooling aspect means having all of the underlying hardware infrastructure that makes these cloud services available to cloud consumers
    - Whether that's in the public cloud or the private cloud, whether it's public cloud and on-premises systems, and so on.
  - The rapid elasticity cloud characteristic means that we can quickly deploy or provision and deprovision cloud resources as we need them 
    - Or alternatively as we don't need them.
  - Self-provisioning means that we have the ability to deploy services like virtual machines and databases
    - Whether it's in a private cloud, a public cloud, and in this context with a hybrid, it really could be a combination of both.
  - The metered usage would apply certainly to public cloud computing, where as a cloud customer charging is based on our consumption of public cloud services. 
    - In the case of a hybrid cloud which could also involve a private cloud
    - We might also be charged by the IT department in our organization for the amount of resources that were used by a specific department within the company. 
    - Maybe not even a department, perhaps a specific project team it may help to build costs for our private cloud based on what was used for a particular project
  - With a hybrid cloud, we're talking about the use of more than one type of IT computing environment, hence the word hybrid or combination thereof. 
    - The use of public cloud services through Microsoft Azure. The use of private cloud services if we've got an on-premises dedicated cloud
    - Perhaps the use of on-premises services that aren't even in a cloud environment
    - An example of that might be replicating an on-premises SQL database into the Azure cloud to increase availability.
  - Hybrid clouds are also often used when companies are adopting cloud computing
    - Where there is on-premises migration of either IT systems like websites or servers that we want to move into the cloud
    - As well as the migration of data that currently might reside on-premises and moving that into the cloud.
  - Often during the migration, there is a hybrid cloud computing environment which is some systems or services and data are on-premises, others in the public cloud
    - And you could run that for an extended period of time, maybe that's your design. 
    - Maybe you're using the cloud as an alternative site in case something happens to your on-premises location. 
    - You might also only do with this during migration to the cloud.
  - There could be parallel systems running in both locations on-premises and in the cloud, or we might over the long term keep this as a permanent solution
    - Commonly, this is done with things like on-premises data that gets replicated to the public cloud. 
    - That could be in the form of as we discussed a SQL database or we might simply be using Microsoft Azure as an off site backup storage location.
  - We could examine things like database replicas that might exist in different parts of our networks 
    - This can be on-premises, in the public cloud, even in the public cloud in different geographical regions. 
    - However, that unto itself would still be public cloud, and therefore not considered a hybrid type of cloud solution.


Community Clouds
  - Community clouds are an interesting cloud type. 
    - Like public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds, community clouds adhere to the standard cloud computing characteristics such as broad access. 
    - In this context, we're talking about accessing community cloud services over a network such as the Internet, but it's limited. 
    - For example, there might be only certain specific cloud IT services that are geared towards the finance industry, or specific governments in countries
    - Another example is maybe to the medicinal and hospitalization type of industries.
  - Resource pooling means putting all of the underlying infrastructure resources together that allow cloud computing services to be available to customers. 
    - In this context, if we, for example, need to adhere to certain US government standards
      - There might be certain hardware security modules that deal with the cryptographic key storage 
      - These are used in terms of underlying resources that are required for compliance in order for specific government agencies to even use cloud computing
  - Rapid elasticity means the same thing in the community cloud as it would, for instance, with the public cloud. 
    - It means that we have the ability as a cloud customer to quickly provision or deprovision cloud services as we need them. 
    - The self-provisioning would be the same, whereby we might have a web interface through which we provision these community cloud services. 
    - And it might also be available at the command-line level and programmatically through exposed APIs from the cloud provider.
  - Metered usage would apply the same in that we are charged for our use of community cloud service offerings based on a certain fee. 
    - That fee might be, for example, virtual machines that are running on an hourly basis
    - Or it could be the amount of storage that we're using and how often we put data into storage in the cloud and read data from that storage in the cloud.
  - Community clouds have limited access
    - For example, Microsoft Azure has specific government cloud options that are supported for the US government
    - There are also option, for example, for specific countries like Germany
    - This can also be used for specific industries that need certain regulatory compliance in place, such as the medical industry.
  - Community clouds are really for groups that have the same IT computing requirements and often that deals with laws and regulations related to data privacy
    - It can also deal with things like the physical location of data
    - In other words, where are the Azure data centers that will be housing this information and running these cloud-based systems?
  - We could also require specific security controls be put in place, as we mentioned earlier. 
    - HSM or hardware security module types of devices are used to store cryptographic keys for safekeeping. 
    - This might be required by laws or regulations to be used in conjunction with IT services in the cloud.
  - There might also be industry-specific cloud software that needs to be used. 
    - For example, maybe only certain approved software can be used by US government agencies in the cloud.


Azure IaaS
  - Infrastructure as a Service is a type of cloud service model
    - It's a term that's often simply referred to as IaaS and it really applies to IT administrators that want to deploy some kind of infrastructure components
    - This would be in a cloud computing environment and is certainly something that can be done with Microsoft Azure.
  - Examples of Microsoft Azure Infrastructure as a Service items include things like storage, so building a storage account in Azure. 
    - Deploying Linux or Windows Virtual machines in the Azure cloud
      - Or even configuring virtual network items like, VNets and subnets into which we can then deploy things like virtual machines and Azure. 
      - Load balancers so that we can take incoming client requests for an application and distribute it among a number of backend hosts that support that app
  - IP addresses can be configured
    - For instance, we might want to make sure that we have a public IP address assigned to an Azure IaaS virtual machine
    - This is so that we can reach into it from outside of the cloud, over the Internet
    - Maybe we would like to be able to manage a Linux virtual machine from our on-premises environment through an SSH connection
    - We can also configure route tables to control traffic flow in the cloud. 
    - All of these are examples of Infrastructure as a Service type of items available in Azure.
  - With Azure Infrastructure as a Service, we have to think about who is responsible for these components. 
    - Whether it be Microsoft at the Azure data center side or whether it's us as a cloud customer
    - So Microsoft Azure, the cloud provider is going to be responsible for things like the physical hypervisor servers on which our virtual machine guests run. 
    - Microsoft is also responsible for the underlying network hardware, the routers, and the switches, and the network connections
      - As well as physical storage being made available.
    - As cloud customers, what are we responsible for? Well, it's up to us to deploy Linux or Windows virtual machines
    - So how many cloud storage accounts we want to build in Azure? How their properties are configured? 
    - And also whether data is encrypted, whether it's replicated across regions, and so on. That becomes our responsibility as customers.
  - We can manage Azure Infrastructure as a Service items that we've discussed, like virtual machines and storage accounts, using the Azure portal. 
    - This is essentially the web graphical user interface to manage Azure resources. 
    - We can use the Azure CLI, we can use Azure PowerShell cmdlets
    - For developers, the Azure REST API can be used to communicate with APIs that are exposed for all Azure services.
