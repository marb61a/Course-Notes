                    Course Notes Part 11

Create a Storage Account (Cont)
  - The first thing we have to think about is the subscription to which this storage account will be tied
    - Then you have to associate this with a resource group. 
    - Either create a new one or choose from an existing one which will be in the drop down list
  - Further down below give a name to the storage account. 
    - Uppercase letters will not be allowed however Lowercase are fine. 
    - If I start using uppercase letters I get a little red error message here about the fact that the name can only contain lowercase letters and numbers
    - Notice if I back out of the capital letters here, that if I just put in a name that's already in use that isn't globally unique. 
    - It will tell me so go ahead and call it something, it'll determine whether or not that's a unique name. 
    - In this case it is because we've got the green check mark. We don't have the red error text. 
    - Of course, we always need to make sure we adhere to organizational naming standards as it applies to the creation of Azure resources. 
    - For the location, I'm going to specify a region and the performance will be either Standard or Premium.
  - In other words, with Standard, do we want to use older hard disk technology like magnetic hard disks that spin. 
    - Or the newer solid-state storage which provides better performance? Of course, it also means an increased cost
    - Depending on what we're planning on doing with the stuff that we put in the storage account really determines the next couple of selections. 
    - If we're not going to have frequent access to what we're going to store in the cloud, we might want to just stick with standard performance.
  - If we are going to have frequent access and we want it to be speedy, maybe we should look at using Premium
    - Users have also got to specify the account kind, whether it's StorageV2, general purpose storage. 
    - Or general purpose version one storage, or BlobStorage. 
    - With general purpose version two type of storage, we have an access tier, Cool or Hot. 
    - Similar to Standard and Premium, for frequently access data and the speediest access we should be choosing the Hot access tier. 
    - If this is more of an archive type of usage scenario, we would look at using a Cool access tier.
  - If I were to switch this to Storage general purpose v1, notice that we lose the option of selecting the storage tier
    - If I were to choose BlobStorage, binary large object, we then get a couple of additional options for replication. 
    - The first option is locally redundant storage or LRS
    - This means that we've got some replication that will occur within the Azure environment but at a very small level. 
    - Not, for example, across regions. Whereas Geo-redundant storage, if we were to select that, does provide replication across Azure regions geographically. 
    - The benefit of doing this is that if there's some kind of a large-scale disaster or outage within an entire geographical region.
  - Your data's already been replicated elsewhere, and you can access it that way. 
    - Then we've got another variation called Read-ahead geo-redundant storage, RA-GRS. 
    - Essentially, this is similar to replicating across Azure regions, the difference being that we would have read-access only to a replica. 
    - Depending on what your storage requirements are will determine what you select here. 
    - It's important to realize that if we were to choose StorageV2 general purpose v2.
  - We can change it later on if we want to for example, BlobStorage. 
    - If we're going to be working with storage for example virtual machine hard disks
      - This can be changed later on
    - Generally speaking, the general purpose v2 account kind is what you'll see used more often than not in Azure. So I'm going to go ahead and click Next.
  - Here we have a couple of options such as whether we want to enable secure transfer. 
    - This would mean only allowing connections over HTTPS or newer versions of SMB, the Server Message Block protocol. 
    - This is as opposed to older, less secure standards, leave that on Enabled.
  - Then we can determine where we want to allow access from in terms of virtual networks. 
    - Currently, it should say All networks. 
    - If I were to click Selected network, then from the drop-down list, I could choose an existing Azure virtual network that I previously have defined. 
  - Leave that disabled as a default setting, and then click Next.
  - So we then get to decide whether we want to assign a tag to this storage account. 
    - It should be remembered that tagging is just metadata, it's extra information that you might use here. 
    - You can search, or sort, or assign costs to a department or a project
    - From the name drop-down list, if I've already defined a tag before which I have, it'll show up.
  - Then give it a value, and I can also see any existing values I might have used for tagging
    - I could add a multitude of tags but I'm just going to leave it that way for now, technically, I don't have to add tags at all.
  - Click Next to review the settings.
  - It says the validation has passed based on my selection. We have a little summary here of what's going to be created. 
    - I also have the option to download a template for automation.
    - That is an ARM template that uses JSON file syntax, why would I do that?
  - I might download it if I want to be able to deploy a storage account with all these settings from the template in the future. 
    - Maybe even using the Azure CLI or PowerShell, which is way quicker than doing it here and clicking on all these things in the screen. 
    - It allows for repetition, automation, that type of thing. 
    - If this suits then click on the Create button to create the storage account.
  - It's taking us into an overview screen for the deployment of our new storage account.
  - We can see some information related to it down below. 
    - At the same time, I can simply go over to All resources on the left, after I refresh it, we'll see that we do have our new storage account listed.
  - As always, we can see the resource group, it was deployed into the region or location. 
    - In this case, if you've added the Tags column, you'll see that here too
    - The Tags column is not normally here by default unless you go to Edit columns
  - Select it on the left and then click the arrow to move it on the right, which I've already done. 
    - Therefore, I can see some tag information. If I were to click on that storage account, it opens up the properties blade for it.
  - I could go back and take a look at the tags and make changes to it. 
    - Or I could go through and look at the settings specific, in this case to a storage account. 
    - This can be things such as geo-replication options, if I want to enable that type of item.
  - I can see if I want to configure blob service settings and so on.
  - We have a number of properties available then after we've configured an Azure storage account. 


Azure Blob Storage GUI Management
  - To get started here in the portal, I'm going to click Create a resource over on the left.
  - I want to create a storage account, so one way for me to do that, is to go under the Storage category here and then on the right to choose Storage accounts. 
  - Now I have to tie it to a resource group there should already be one called Rg1, and down below give it a name.
  - Now notice if I start typing in things like capital letters, it says here that the account name can use only lower case letters and, of course, numbers. 
    - It also needs to be between 3 and 24 characters, fine
    - When we plan out how we're going to name our Azure resources, we should have a standard naming convention. 
    - This could be something such as stor, for storage account, S-T-O-R, then I'm going to give it a number to make it unique.
  - Choose a storage location that reflects where it might be used geographically
    - Choose between Standard and Premium types of storage, where I can determine, for example, whether or not I have access to these cool and hot access tiers
    - If it's standard, I do have access to that, and I could choose BlobStorage for the account kind, but I could also choose Premium for performance.
  - Notice I don't get BlobStorage available when I do that
    - It's important to understand the ramifications of the choices you make here and what features will follow down below. 
    - I want to work with BlobStorage here, so I'm going to leave it on standard, and I'm going to choose BlobStorage. 
    - Then determine if I want replication, locally-redundant storage, geo-redundant storage, and read-access geo-redundant storage. 
    - Think of locally redundant storage as meaning that your data is replicated only within an Azure data center.
  - Therefore, if you've got a problem with an Azure data center, you could lose all your data if you don't have it stored elsewhere. 
    - Geo-redundant storage will replicate your data across multiple Azure regions
    - In the case of an Azure data center problem, even an Azure regional disaster, your data's still been replicated elsewhere
    - There is also read-ahead geo-redundant storage, RA-GRS. 
    - What this means is that you've got a primary replica that's writable, and then the replica itself from that is only allowable through read access. 
    - In this case, leave it on locally-redundant storage
    - Leave it on the hot access tier assuming that I'm going to be accessing the Blobs that I will populate the storage account with on a frequent basis.
  - Click Next to view any advanced options. Do I want secure transfers enabled? 
    - Do I want to limit the virtual networks from which access is allowed to this storage account? I'm not going to change anything here.
    - I can click Next and then apply tags if applicable.
