                    Course Notes Part 49
  
  
  - It relates to things like strong access control and protection of data at rest
    - But in order for us to implement these types of security controls in accordance with these types of data privacy frameworks
    - We need to first identify things like Personally Identifiable Information within the organization 
    - And the systems that will process and store that type of information
  - Then, we have to think about minimizing the collection and use of Personally Identifiable Information 
    - So that it only is used strictly for business-related purposes
    - There are many other bodies of frameworks related to data privacy, including the International Standards Organization, ISO
    - This is international, and one of the many standards is ISO/IEC 27017:2015
    - This deals with cloud computing security controls, related to things like access control
    - So being authenticated and then authorized to use specific cloud services or resources.
  - Cloud tenant isolation or separation from one another
    - And also the secure removal of cloud tenant data so that there are no artifacts that can be retrieved by unauthorized parties after the fact
    - With data privacy frameworks, the first thing we have to consider is which data privacy laws and regulations affect the organization
  - Then, we need to think about our cloud solution, in this case, Azure, to ensure that we are adhering to those respective laws or regulations
    - We then need to incorporate data privacy into organizational security policies
    - Then within the organization, assign responsibility for compliance to laws and regulations
    - This normally comes in the form of an organizational role called a compliance officer


The Azure Security Center
  - The Microsoft Azure Security Center gives you a central place where you can view security related items 
    - To be in a better position to enhance your security posture with the use of Azure Cloud Computing Services
  - In the Azure Portal, in the navigator on the left at the very bottom, click Security Center
    - But notice everything is gray in the properties blade, and that's because we need to make sure that we're using a security center plan
    - It's not enabled by default, but we're going to go ahead and start a trial, a 30 day free trial to be specific
    - Scroll down here on the far right there we can click Start trial.
    - One of the things that it wants to do is install agents within my virtual machines in my Azure subscription, so it knows how secure they are or are not
  - We've got our subscription selected here, I'm going to go ahead and click Install agents
    - Once that's been done, we can see things become available in the properties blade
    - We are still in the Overview area where we can get a great list of overall suggestions related to security
    - Or rather any security shortcomings related to our Azure environment
  - We can see we've got an overall secure score here of 348 out of 480
    - hat's not 480 out of 480, so let me go ahead and click on that to pull up some details related to that
  - Down below, we can see our subscription, and we can see that we have a View recommendations link up above
    - You can also click on specific categories like Compute & apps versus Identity & access
    - Down below, just click on View recommendations, so we can see all of them
  - Red naturally might be a problem, so let's see, firstly we've got a problem here with our subscription
    - It says that we need to enable MFA multi-factor authentication
    - For accounts that have owner permissions on our subscription, apparently, that's not been done
    - With multi-factor authentication, instead of having knowledge of the username and password with overall access to our subscription
  - We could add another factor such as requiring a smartphone that has a constantly changing numeric value, that is only good for a few seconds
    - When we have to authenticate, we'd have to specify the numeric code which is only good for a short period of time
    - In addition to having knowledge of the username and the password
    - That's a good way to secure our accounts through multi-factor authentication
  - It says here we should also enable network security groups on subnets
    - Remember, you can click on each of these to get more further detail about what that description is for that recommendation.
    - It'll go ahead and tell us the culprit, so to speak here, which in this case, happens to be Subnet1.
  - When we actually click on that, we can actually see details related to that
    - Such as the network security group, which is set to none for that specific subnet
    - We can drill down and actually solve problems
    - We can also see here that we don't have endpoint protection installed on virtual machines
    - For things like anti-malware at least, in this case, for one of two virtual machines
    - If we click on that to drill down, we can see here the severity level is high and the culprit is a virtual machine called eastwindowsvm1.
  - Notice that we've got a link here to install on 1 VM, just click it and choose to install Microsoft anti-malware
    - Not only does it point out any security deficiencies but it gives us a very convenient and easy way to solve the problem
    - Of course, if you have that problem on hundreds of virtual machines, that's probably not the best way to deal with it, however, it does work
  - Here, we've got Install on 1 VMs because that is what happens to be selected here
    - If we select a bunch of them, for example, hundreds of them
    - Then we can have the ability to install that endpoint protection agent on hundreds of VMs at once, so it's very convenient
  - As we go further down the list in the Azure Security Center
    - We can also see it suggests that we don't have disk encryption applied on virtual machines for protection of data at rest, we can go ahead and do that
    - The security center that is designed to give us details on any security shortcomings in our Azure environment
    - Along with the convenient way to address those concerns.


Azure Service Trust Portal
  - The Microsoft Azure Service Trust Portal allows us to track compliance, to run audit reports on that compliance
    - Also to focus on data protection in line with laws and regulations
    - The Azure Service Trust Portal allows us to work with the Compliance Manager
    - This allows us to be compliant with different data protection regulations including HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001, to name just a few
  - We can also track our compliance with specific rules that need to be followed, and we can also even assign compliance responsibility
    - In the Azure Service Trust Portal, another aspect is auditing
    - Where we can run audit reports for compliance with standards related to ISO, PCI DSS for cardholder data protection, FedRAMP, SOC, otherwise called SOC.
  - For example, SOC3 allows organizations to adhere to rules for internal controls within an organization 
    - For things like business processes and the integrity of those business processes
    - Finally, the Azure Service Trust Portal also deals with data protection, where documentation is made available
    - There is also mappings made between data privacy frameworks, a variety of them
    - To the Azure security controls will allow organizations to be compliant in those specific regards
    - There are also frequently asked question documents and white papers that are available for Azure IT technicians.


Block Public SSH and RDP Traffic
  - When you deploy Linux and Windows virtual machines into Azure, you probably want to remotely manage them from on-premises
    - So you might use SSH to get into Linux hosts or the remote desktop protocol client to get into Windows hosts
    - The problem is we don't want that type of accessibility through a public IP address on each VM
  - Instead ideally, we would use a point to site VPN connection from our administration on-premises to Azure
    - Then SSH or RDP to the private IP address of those VMs
    - In the Azure Portal, start by going into the Virtual machines view on the left
    - Start with our eastlinuxvm1 virtual machine that's running Linux.
  - The first thing I notice is it does have a public IP address
    - If that's only for the purpose of allowing inbound administration, that's a problem
    - So what we're going to do is click on Networking over on the left as well
  - We can see here that if we look at the effective security rules, click on Effective security rules
    - The virtual machine has to be running for effective rules to display here
    - We'll then see that we've got access that would be allowed here into the virtual machine over a specific port
