                    Course Notes Part 7


Azure Resource Groups (Cont)
  - Now aside from doing that, if I were, for example, to deploy a new virtual machine
    - Click on Virtual machines on the left 
    - This should open the Virtual machines page opens in the content pane. 
    - There is a toolbar, filter options, and a table with no data. A message will indicate if there are no virtual machines to display. 
    - Click the Add button in the Virtual machines view, you'll also notice that as you deploy resources here in Azure
    - The Create a virtual machine wizard launches. The Basics tabbed page of the wizard displays. 
    - You also get the chance to select an existing resource group but you can also create a new one here while you're deploying this resource. 
  - Close out of this Create a virtual machine window and go back to the Resource groups view over on the left
    - Click Add so we can have one here then the Create a resource group wizard launches and the Basics tabbed page displays
  - You need to tie it to a subscription that is listed in the pay as you go subscription
    - In the PROJECT DETAILS section, point to the Subscription drop-down list
      - Then enter the name of a resource group eg call my first resource group Rg1
      - If this were a resource group that would be used to manage the Azure resources to support a web application, I would have a more meaningful name. 
      - Perhaps the name of the web application followed by Rg
    - It's important in Azure that you have a standard when it comes to naming conventions for items
    - In this example case stick with Rg1 for resource group one.
  - There is a need determine into which region I want to create this resource
    - Open the drop-down list, I can choose whichever one makes the most sense
    - In the RESOURCE DETAILS section expand the Region drop-down list
    - Several regions are listed including Australia East, Brazil South, and Canada East, select one
    - Click Next, the Tags tabbed page of the wizard opens 
      - There is a table with three columns: NAME, VALUE, and RESOURCE. [Video description ends]
  - Here we can build a tag or we can add multiple tags, which is really just metadata. 
    - You can do this for more than just resource groups in Azure
    - You might, for example, do it for storage accounts or virtual machines so you could tag it and assign it to a specific department 
    - Create a new tag called Project this is going to be for a project that we are currently working on called ProjectA
    - In the first data row of the table type "Project" in the NAME field and "ProjectA" in the VALUE field. 
    - The RESOURCE value is automatically set to Resource group tag this resource group with this.
    - You don't have to tag.
  - Click the Review + Create button down at the bottom.
    - There should be a little summary of what we are configuring, which is a resource group
      - The SUMMARY list also displays the Subscription value of Pay-As-You-Go. 
      - Click Create and the wizard closes and a message indicates briefly that the resource group was created
  - Refresh the Resource groups view, it should be seen clearly that we've got our resource group, Rg1, listed here. 
    - So I could click on it to select it to open up its properties blade
    - There should be a navigator here on the left related to the property categories for the resource group called Rg1. 


Azure Portal
  - The Microsoft Azure portal is a GUI tool, a graphical user interface type of tool, that comes in the form of a web application
    - This facilitates managing Azure resources, it's a GUI management tool that also supports RBAC self-provisioning
    - RBAC stands for role based access control which means that we give other administrators limited access to manage specific resources instead of everything
  - The Azure portal has a lot of functionality. And part of this includes, of course, creating and managing Azure resources
    - For example, you can very quickly, using the portal, deploy a new Linux or Windows virtual machine
      - Or a storage account to store files in the cloud, or even quickly deploy in Azure SQL database
      - You don't have to know any commands to type in, it's all done visually.
  - We can also work with ARM templates, Azure resource manager templates. 
    - ARM templates use the JSON file syntax and they allow us to create and manage Azure resources of any type
    - We can use an ARM template to create resources like storage accounts in virtual machines
    - We can also use the portal to edit templates as well as importing existing templates into the portal and maybe tweet them
    - We can also even download ARM templates
    - Whenever you deploy your resource in the Azure portal, it's watching what you're doing and tracking in the background 
      - What that comprises of in terms of JSON commands.
    - You can then download an ARM template based on what you've deployed in the GUI.
  - In the Azure portal, we can also tag resources. 
    - Tagging means adding extra metadata, such as assigning a virtual machine and a storage account to a specific project
      - Or maybe to a specific department within a large organization
    The benefit of tagging is that you can then search based on the tag
      - For instance, show me all deployed Azure resources related to project A
      - Or another example is when I would like to see all deployed Azure resources for billing purposes related to the human resources department.
  - We can also search for resources within the Azure portal. 
    - Instead of rummaging around through potentially dozens, hundreds, even thousands of deployed resources in a larger subscription
    - We could simply search for what we're looking for, such as a specific virtual machine that we want to manage.
  - There's also this notion of the Azure Cloud Shell
    - When we talk about the Azure Cloud Shell, we're talking about either issuing commands using a Linux-style bash shell or using PowerShell cmdlets. 
    - This allows command line management of Azure resources. 
    - Instead of having to download, and install, and configure, and authenticate to some command line tool like the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell
      - You can do this or instead you can simply launch the Azure Cloud Shell within the portal, and you're already authenticated.
  - PowerShell also supports a number of built-in languages
    - If you want to work with Node.js, or Java, or Python, it's available. 
    - It also supports Azure file share storage so if you need to store something in a file persistently between Azure Cloud Shell sessions you can do it
      - Azure Cloud Shell is yet another benefit of working through the Azure portal.


Navigate the Azure Portal
  - The Azure portal is a web-based GUI management tool for Azure resources. 
    - Navigate portal.azure.com and it, of course, has changed it and pick an account to login with. 
  - Choose my Azure account, at which point it wants me to specify the password for that account. 
    - Enter both the account and the password in and choose Sign in. 
      - You should be brought to the main home screen in the Azure portal
      - This is where we can see that we've got a quick way to quickly jump into things like virtual machines. 
  - If I click Virtual machines in the content pane it takes me into the Virtual machines viewer. 
    - The Virtual machines page opens. 
    - There is a toolbar, fields for filtering, and a table of virtual machines arranged in columns that include NAME, TYPE, and STATUS.
    - Running VM's currently will have a status of Running. 
  - If I go back to Home I can also view Storage accounts and do the same type of thing
    - Return to the Home page, then click Storage accounts
      - The Storage accounts page opens. There is a toolbar, fields for filtering
      - And a table of virtual machines arranged in columns that include NAME, TYPE, and KIND
  - Of course, we've got a left-hand navigator, so if we want to view SQL databases, 
    - Click SQL databases in the navigation panel and the SQL databases page opens. 
      - It has a similar layout to the other pages
      - If we want to view Azure Active Directory, click Azure Active Directory in the navigation pane. 
      - The Default Directory - Overview page opens, this page has its own navigation and content panes
      - Perhaps there is a need to view users or groups that are defined, we can do that
      - Clicks User in the navigation pane and The Users - All users page opens
