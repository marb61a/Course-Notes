Azure Resource Locking Using the CLI
  - You can lock Azure resources to prevent deletion or modifications at the subscription, resource group, and individual resource level
    - You can do that in the portal or, as we're going to see here, we can also do that using the CLI using the az lock create command
    - We are going to name our lock Rg1Lock because we're going to lock a resource group
    - Which will also apply to the child items deployed within that resource group
  - Then we are going to use --lock-type and then use CanNotDelete, so preventing deletion
    - We are going to specify the resource group by name here of course, using --resource-group
    - The resource group in question here we want to apply the locking to is Rg1, then press Enter
    - After a moment, we can see that it appears we have some output from that command that tells us that the lock is in place
  - Clear the screen and let's verify this, by typing az space lock space list, this will show us any locks that we currently have in place
    - Here, we can see that it's called Rg1Lock
    - It's set to CannotDelete, and it's set for a particular resource group in this case, Rg1.
  - In the Azure portal, if we were to open up that resource group and view its properties blade and then click Locks
    - We would see here that we've got our lock here, Rg1Lock that we just created through the Azure CLI, so indeed, it is in effect.
  - We can also use the az lock show command, so we can view the id related to that lock
    - Which we see up here, we see the id
    - All we are doing here is telling it we want to show something specific about a lock called Rg1Lock for a resource-group called Rg1
  - We are going to control the output and view the id
    - We are going to query for the id, in other words only show us the id
    - That's really essentially what we see up here at the top
    - Go ahead and copy that, because what we can then do is use that id to remove the lock using az lock delete
    - Of course we can just use --ids and paste in or we can use a variable if we really wanted to
  - Go ahead and remove the lock that way after that's completed, let's just clear the screen
    - If we run az lock list, then we're going to get a whole lot of nothing returned because we no longer have a resource lock, we have removed it


Azure Resource Locking Using PowerShell
  - Use Microsoft PowerShell to manage Azure resource locks
    - Resource locking is helpful if you want to prevent unwanted modifications or the deletion of Azure resources
    - We can set locking at the subscription resource group or at the resource level
    - In the PowerShell ISE, we've already got a script here
    - Where in line 1 we are creating or locking a resource using the New-AzResourceLock PowerShell commandlet
  - We have to provide a name for this lock, so call this Rg1, for resource group 1, NoDelete
    - The LockLevel here will be CannotDelete, but we can also specify that we want to prevent modifications as opposed to deletions
    - Here the resource group name to which we want this applied is called rg1.
  - Go ahead and execute that one line by putting our cursor on the line somewhere here in the ISE and then clicking the Run Selection button
    - Wget a prompt, are you sure you want to create that lock? Yes, so click Yes
    - After a moment it appears that it's done, so check our work in the portal
  - In the portal, we are in the resource groups view, Rg1 is there so click on it
    - In the Properties blade click Locks
    - Here we could see we've got the Rg1NoDelete lock name that we just specified and applied from PowerShell
  - Of course, here in PowerShell, we can view any current lock configuration using the Get-AzResourceLock commandlet
    - Clear the screen down below, then on line 3 here to run Get-AzResourceLock
    - Again, we can see here it is, we've only got one here, it's called Rg1NoDelete
    - We know that it will be applied specifically to our resource group called rg1.
  - The next thing we want to do is remove that lock
    - The first thing we can do here is create a variable
    - Creating a variable here called lockId
    - We are going to run Get-AzResourceLock and going to specify the ResourceGroupName
    - Then we are going to refer to the .LockID property
    - The reason that we've got the open and closed parentheses here is 
    - Because we need some way to tell Powershell that what is within the parentheses is part of one expression, one statement in PowerShell.
  - After that, we want to refer to a property
    - If I don't have the parentheses around it, it's going to think that rg1.LockId is a parameter value
    - When really the only parameter value here for ResourceGroupName is rg1
    - The result of that, the ID, the LockId, will be put in the LockId variable
    - So after that in line 7, we can simply remove it using Remove-AzResourceLock
    - Just tell up a LockId based on the variable that we've created back up here in line 5
    - Select those lines of code in my script here and I'm going to click the Run Selection button
    - We then get a prompt,  Are you sure you want to delete that? selct Yes
    - This looks like it's good, Why don't we verify our work by running Get-AzResourceLock? 
    - We get a whole lot of nothing, check it out in the Azure portal to ensure all is right
    - In the portal, I'm just going to open up that resource group and look at Locks, and we now see it says, this resource has no locks.


Common Data Privacy Frameworks
  - Data privacy has a big impact on organizational security policies especially as related to cloud computing
    - We have to consider the types of data that we need to safeguard using data privacy frameworks
    - Data such as Personally Identifiable Information otherwise called P-I-I or PII, Protected Health Information, PHI
  - Data that resides within specific national boundaries might be subject to specific laws and regulations
    - Then we need to consider data that's being transmitted into a country from elsewhere, and also data being transmitted out of a country
    - With data privacy frameworks, the first consideration is Personally Identifiable Information or PII
    - Which would include things like a person's phone number, their credit history, their mother's maiden name
    - Their social security number, their credit card number, and so on
  - Essentially, whatever can uniquely identify an individual in some way is called Personally Identifiable Information
    - On the right, we've got Protected Health Information which is more medically related
    - It would include things such as a patient's name, medical discharge dates, medical payments, past procedures, drugs that had been administered, and so on
  - In relation to this type of information, we have to consider data privacy frameworks which outline how the data will be collected, 
    - How the data will be used and whether or not the data will be shared with third parties
    - Often users must supply consent to some or all of these activities
    - There are also maybe laws and regulations that stipulate that this data collection use and sharing must be related directly to business practices
    - One example of data privacy is the General Data Protection Regulation otherwise called GDPR
    - This applies to European Union countries and is all about data privacy within the European Union
    - But also it deals with data that will be exported outside of the European Union
    - Microsoft Azure is GDPR compliant
    - If an organization is found to be in breach of GDPR standards, then they could possibly be fined up to 4% 
    - Of their annual global amount of profit or 20 million pounds, whichever one is greater.
  - There's definitely an incentive then for European Union organizations that will work with data to make sure that they adhere with the GDPR
    - Then we've got the National Institute of Standards and Technology, otherwise called NIST
    - This is a set of international standards, some of which are related to IT security, so the cybersecurity framework
    - Which focuses on things like critical infrastructure
    - Critical infrastructure would be things like the power grid, water supplies, dams, that type of thing
      - Also, sensitive data related to that hosted by cloud providers
      - There are many different types of publications such as NIST Special Publication or SP 800-122
      - This specifically is the guide to protecting the confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information or PII, P-I-I
