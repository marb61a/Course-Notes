Managing Custom RBAC Roles Using the Portal
  - Once you've created a custom role, and we've already done this using the Azure CLI
    - Now it's time to assign it, and to put it into effect, and we are going to do that in the Azure portal
    - We can apply custom roles or built-in roles at the Azure subscription level, or to be a little more specific, in the hierarchy below that
  - We can assign roles to specific scopes like resource groups, or even individual resources, like storage accounts, and virtual machines, and so on
    - In this case, we are going to do it for the subscription level
    - In the search box at the top, we are going to search for sub, and choose Subscriptions, and then click on the subscription
    - We are going to choose Access Control (IAM)
  - Here, we'll see any roles that are available here, whether they're built in
    - Or as we scroll further, and further down, such as into the T's, we'll also see our custom role called The Overseer
    - We can also click the Add button up here if we actually want to add a role assignment, which we do.
  - Choose Add role assignment, and the role here is going to be the custom RBAC role that was created called The Overseer
    - If we actually hover over the little information I, it even shows the description
    - In this case it says Subscription-level viewing, so select that
    - We want to assign this custom role to a group in Azure Active Directory Called HQ_AzureIT, and so click Save
  - At this point the role has been applied to the entire Azure subscription, so if we go look at Azure Active Directory groups
    - If we take a look at that group, HQ_AzureIT, and specifically the members, the members of the group
    - In this case only one, Jonathon Gold, will assume the privileges of that custom role which is read-only access to all items
    - In this case, for the entire subscription
  - We've just jumped in to Wordpad here so that we could quickly look at the definition that was used to create that custom role in the CLI
    - Notice here, it is read access tied to a subscription, so the AssignableScope is set to the subscription level.


Azure Resource Tagging
  - You can add tags to Azure resources for descriptive purposes
    - Tagging an item such as a storage account, or a web app, or even a virtual machine, for instance, allows you to add metadata, more detailed information
    - Perhaps a project that something is assigned to, or a department that something falls under for billing purposes
    - To get started in the Azure Portal, go to the Virtual machines view
    - For no purpose other than to select some kind of an individual Azure resource
  - We are going to select one of our virtual machines, to open up its Properties blade
    - Notice that whenever you look at the Properties blade for, really, any type of Azure resource, you're going to see a Tags item
    - When you click Tags, you'll see any existing tags that might have been set already
    - For example, this virtual machine is already flagged as Project
    - That's the name of the tag, with a value of ProjectB.
  - We can also add multiple tags to an item, for example, we could build a new tag here called Department
    - Over here, we might put in Sales, so now there's two tags
    - We have to click Save in this case, for that to apply to that particular item
  - We can also select multiple items if we want to tag them all at once
    - In this case for an example sey that we want to select a couple of virtual machines
    - We can select them here, then we can click the Assign tags button up at the top
    - From here, we can choose from existing tag names that were created, for example, there's Department.
  - If we want to assign them to Sales, then I can go ahead and do that
    - Once done, we can click Save to apply those tags
    - You can also work with tags programmatically, and through the CLI, and through PowerShell
  - One of the reasons that that works well is because you can filter resources, for example here in the GUI, by tags
    - Notice here when you go to the All resources view, we see, well, all resources
    - From here, we can choose the All tags drop-down
    - Select something such as Department, Sales, when we do that, it filters the list
    - We now see only Sales Department-tagged items, which in this case, happens to be those three virtual machines.
  - This can also be helpful for billing, in the search bar search for subscriptions, so sub
    - Go to our subscription, click on it to open it up and what can do within here is go to Cost analysis.
  - Then towards the top here, we can also start to look at this in a variety of different ways
    - Instead of just viewing what's presented in front of me, which is a great way to break down costs
    - We can also click Add filter, we might choose Tag
    - So from here, we can then start to select the appropriate tag information that we want to view
  - Sometimes, newly added tags won't show up here, for example, we don't see Department quite yet
    - But we could choose some existing tags that existed previously, such as project
    - From here, we can start to select exactly what it is that I'm looking for in terms of filtering by, in this case, the project tag
  - To do that down below, open the next drop-down list
    - For example say, we want to see items flagged as projectb
    - We can also choose, for example, to view perhaps this quarter or this year
    - So we are filtering out by the projectb tag, that's the value
    - Then we can now see that the numbers are changing based on my filtered selection


Azure Resource Locking in the Portal
  - Sometimes, IT technicians make mistakes
    - So one option in Azure is to lock resources, you can lock resources from either being deleted or being modified
    - You can do this at various levels such as doing it at the subscription level, a resource group level, or a specific resource
    - It's kind of like a safeguard, to get started in Azure, in the portal
    - Go to our Virtual machines view to lock a particular virtual machine.
  - Let's say our first VM here, eastlinuxvm1, click on it to open up it's Properties blade
    - You'll notice when you're working in the Azure portal is that if you scroll down of the Properties blade, you're always going to see this Locks item
    - When you select it you'll see the current state of locking on that resource
  - This one states that this resource has no locks, click Add to add a lock
    - We have to give a name to the lock for example PreventChanges
    - The Lock type can either be Read-only, which is what we want here to prevent changes
    - Or Delete, In other words, prevent from being deleted
    - In this case we will choose Read-only, we could add additional Notes but we won't so click OK
  - Notice that we see our current resource locked to prevent changes, it's Read-only for this resource
    - Of course, we can go ahead and Delete that lock at any point in time
    - Try to make a change here, for example try to resize the VM
    - Go to the Size part of the Properties blade and click Resize
    - Immediately, it says Failed to resize the virtual machine and something about resources being locked
  - We know that it's working already
    - If we go and remove that lock, just refresh to make sure it's good and it is
    - If we were to go ahead now and decide that we want to resize something, then it will let us resize it
    - It's in the midst of happening, so we have the option then of doing this at pretty much any level in the hierarchy
    - As an example go into Resource groups, if I go into resource group RG1 there it is, again, Locks
    - As you might expect, it would apply to the child items within the resource group
  - If we start going into Subscriptions, then in the same way
    - We'll also have the option of setting Resource locks down here by choosing Resource locks and clicking Add
    - Basically, filling out the same type of thing again
    - This is a great way then to essentially, protect yourself from yourself if you're the only Azure IT technician
