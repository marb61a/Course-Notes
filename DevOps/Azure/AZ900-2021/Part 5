                    Course Notes Part 5


Cloud Migration (Cont)
  - We can also migrate data that's currently housed on-premises into the cloud 
    - This is as long as it meets specific security requirements that may be applicable based on the industry, or the government agency that we might doing this for
  - We have to also consider the suitability of on-premises IT solutions for migration into the Azure cloud
    - We need to make sure that we can map existing on-premises services to an equivalent solution in the cloud
    - In some cases you might simply be able to take what you're running on-premises and move it essentially into the cloud
    - In other cases you might have to find a functional equivalent that is already made available through Azure service offerings
    - Then you need to consider security standards, such as whether or not you need to encrypt data at rest
      - This includes data stored in a storage account in the Azure cloud.
  - With cloud migration, an important term to be aware of is lift and shift migration. 
    - What this means is we're taking an existing IT solution, and we're migrating it to the cloud without changing it
    - An example of this might be migrating a physical or a virtual server that we currently have running on-premises and migrating it to Azure
    - So really, we're changing the hosting environment in which that virtual machine or maybe we're converting a physical to a virtual.
    - We're changing the hosting environment, but the operating system and its configuration remains exactly as it was on-premises, unchanged.
  - The Azure Migrate Service is an offering that can help with such types of migrations
    - It allows for evaluating the migration suitability for things like virtual machines that are currently running on-premises and the workloads that supported
  - It can also take a look at IT system dependencies. 
    - For instance, you might have a front end web application that depends on a back end data base running in a different virtual machine
    - That kind of system dependency would be caught by the Azure Migrate Service
    - Because you don't want to be in a situation where you're only migrating one part of the solution to the cloud, only to realize it doesn't work in the cloud
  - The Azure Migrate Service can also provide cost estimations as to what you might be looking at for monthly charges on a recurrent basis
    - After you have migrated specific workloads to the cloud.
  - The Azure Migration Service Process begins with creating what's called a project
    - This then requires running an on-premises collector virtual machine. And this is designed to run in a VMware vCenter type of environment
    - That collector virtual machine will then gather data from on-premises and that gets sent to the Azure project.
  - Next, that discovered data is organized into specific groups
    - This discovered data really comes from on-premises virtual machines that we're considering migrating to the Azure cloud. 
  - Finally, the last step of working with the Azure Migration Service Process is to assess the results
    - This will determine in fact if it is a migration that will take place


Azure Data Centers
  - Microsoft Azure data centers are the physical side of Microsoft Azure cloud computing
    - A couple of terms usually come to mind when talking about data centers. 
    - Physical facilities is one of them. 
    - A data center is a physical facility, often a very large building or a collection of buildings that house computing equipment. 
    - In this case, for potentially thousands of different cloud customers.
  - In the case of Microsoft Azure physical facilities, or data centers, exist currently in 140 countries around the globe. 
    - Although that will be changing over time
    - Physical security then becomes an important aspect of it, due to the fact that we do have a centralized location physically
    - This houses a lot of potentially sensitive data for many different customers
    - The result is that it would be difficult to get a specific address for a Microsoft Azure data center, as the actual physical locations are not disclosed.
  - One data center component to consider, much like you would if you had a data center owned by a single large organization or even a server room within a building
    - Is HVAC. Heating and ventilation and air conditioning. 
    - Within a data center, on a large scale, it's absolutely crucial that we've got pathways for air to travel
    - This is so that we can take warm air exhaust and feed it away from equipment, often out of the facility
    - Then, of course, have cool air fed into the facility from the outside and maybe through air-conditioning units that are filtered to equipment intake fans.
  - The next thing that we should consider is the number of equipment racks that would exist within a data center. 
    - It's often a very large number because pretty much everything these days, every physical computing device, is an appliance that can be rack mounted
    - This is whether it's a hypervisor server that's used to host virtual machines running in the Azure cloud environment
    - Or whether it is storage arrays that Azure customers enjoy when it comes to provisioning cloud storage. 
    - Whether it is physical routers and switches to provide network connectivity. 
    - Wheter it is UPSs, UPSs, uninterruptible power supplies
      - They are used for short-term battery power for a device to shut down gracefully when it detects that the AC power from the power grid is no longer there.
      - For longer-term power supplies perhaps look at things like power generators that might run, for instance, off of diesel fuel.
  - At the physical security level, we have to consider things like fencing around the perimeter of an Azure data center. 
    - Along with both interior and exterior alarm systems, often in the form of motion detection sensors. 
    - There should also be physical guards on premises to check badges
    - Mantrap doors work in such a way that after access to an outer door is granted and the door opens there's an area within the door 
      - The person must wait before they can enter a second inner door. 
      - The outer door has to close first. And often these doors are locked, of course
      - They are controlled, or access is granted, through a proximity card and all entry and exit points in the facility are logged centrally.
  - Microsoft performs thorough background checks on all employees sspecially those that work in Microsoft Azure data centers
    - Within the data center, specific rooms that might contain a specific type of equipment, such as storage arrays
    - These might be in a locked area that requires additional access beyond just gaining access to the facility itself. 
    - In the same way, we can also have locked equipment racks so that in order to gain access physically to a device
    - This is whether it is a rack-mount server or a router or a storage array, access must be granted to the rack itself. 
    - We have to physically be able to open the rack before we can even get our hands on the equipment.


Azure Regions
  - Microsoft Azure regions are an important concept to understand. 
    - Whether you're managing Azure at the command line, or whether you're doing it using GUI tools like the Azure portal
    - In some cases you'll see references to, not an Azure region, but rather a location. Either way, it's the same thing.
  - An Azure region is geographical in nature. We are talking about a physical region whereby Azure resources can be deployed. 
    - When you actually deploy new resources like a virtual machine in Azure, you need to specify the location or region. 
    - Currently, Azure has a presence within 140 countries, and that is organized into 54 regions. 
    - Always bear in mind that while these numbers are current, they're always changing. 
    - Microsoft is always looking at expanding Azure with more regions in additional countries.
  - Microsoft Azure also supports some special Azure government cloud options, and those specific regions are not disclosed anywhere. 
    - Unlike standard Azure cloud regions like East US and Canada Central, are made available.
  - You can think here of a region as being interconnected over the Internet by the wide area network link. 
    - You can deploy Azure resources into disparate regions like this
    - You might do that for availability in case there is some kind of a regional disaster. 
  - Availability zones, or otherwise called AZs, exist within a Microsoft Azure region
    - It is the case that most regions have three availability zones, although in some cases, you won't see that. 
    - This means that we've got one or more data centers. 
    - There is not a one-to-one correlation between an Azure availability zone mapping to one data center as it's not always that simple
    - You could have an availability zone that consists of, let's say, three data centers.
  - Then we have to think about Azure Service Availability and how it relates to regions. 
    - The first thing we have to bear in mind is Azure Services, so the cloud stuff that we as customers want to use, varies. 
    - It varies in its availability from one region to the next
    - For example, if we want to use the Azure search feature, when we configure that and deploy it
      - We won't be able to specify a location or region of Canada East, at least not currently
      - As said previously this is always in flux.
    - Another example would be the deployment of G-Series VMs, virtual machines, high-end virtual machines
      - This specific series or type of VM is not available in Central US.
  - GSeries virtual machines might be important to you if you need to accommodate very large database workloads 
    - And you also need as much CPU, memory, and processing power that you can get
    - In some cases this could be very important, but we do need to understand that when we go to manage and deploy resources
    - These will vary in their availability, in some cases from one region to another.
