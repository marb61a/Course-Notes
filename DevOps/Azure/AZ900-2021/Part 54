                    Course Notes Part 54


Azure TCO Calculator
  - Search the Internet for Azure Total Cost of Ownership Calculator, you'll easily arrive at this page
    - Where we've got three steps that we must complete in order to determine what kind of cost savings can be achieved 
    - By migrating what's currently running on-premises into the cloud
  - In step 1, we have to define our workloads, so scroll down, and here we can add workloads related to servers
    - We can add multiple workloads, whether we're using Windows or Linux or some kind of web app server
    - We can leave it on Windows and Linux and currently we might have, let's say, 3 physical servers, we can specify those details running Windows
  - We can determine the number of processors per server. Well, let's say they've each got 2, and each of those has 2 cores
    - We can also specify the amount of RAM. These might currently have 8 gigs of RAM
    - So we can keep adding server workloads based on what is currently running on-premises
  - Because what it's going to do is try to find the equivalent match in the Azure cloud
    - Then we can see how long we'll take to realize a cost savings as part of our TCO
    - Our total cost of ownership. We can also add database information, we've already added some database information here
    - In this case, SQL Server, and we've also determined the destination in the cloud to be SQL Database Managed instances
    - So we can continue to add database workloads here.
  - You can also add storage workloads, we have specified that we've got a storage area network running SSD, about 500 gig currently
    - And we can determine how much space we would need for backup and for archiving, and the amount of performance or disk IOPS
    - And then the anticipated outbound bandwidth, which I'll leave it at the default of 1 gigabyte.
  - When we click Next, then we've got a number of assumptions to consider
    - Such as whether we want Software Assurance coverage
    - We could see it's broken down here by Windows Server, because that's part of the workload that we added
    - And also SQL Server, again, for the same reason, we can turn any of these things on or off
    - We can determine specific features like geo-redundancy, replicating to other regions in Azure
  - We can then scroll down and determine what our price per kilowatt hour is in our particular location
    - So that it can be more accurate when it determines our cost savings over time
    - Because when you run things on the cloud, the space to house equipment and the electricity to power that equipment and the HVAC
    - The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, is no longer your worry
  - That's the problem of the cloud provider, in this case, Microsoft Azure
    - We can fill in all of these fine-tune details like labor costs for having a full time physical server administrator in terms of US dollars etc
    - There are a number of assumptions, but we can leave them as they are and click Next
  - Finally, we can see the amount potentially that we could save over 5 years, by migrating the specified workloads into the Azure cloud
    - As we go further down, it's graphed in a multitude of ways where we can see
    - For instance, the on-premises cost as a blue line here versus the green line
    - Ocourse, like any good investment, it takes time to realize more savings
  - As we go further down, we can see the information presented in different ways
    - Such as the total on-premises costs over 5 years versus the total Azure cloud computing cost for those specified workloads over 5 years
    - All of this stuff is listed in a variety of ways, very valuable information
    - Also at the bottom, we've also got the option of clicking Download
    - When you do that, you get a printing option where I might choose to Save as PDF.
  - That way we have a record of this generated TCO report
    - So we can just go ahead and save that and peruse it at my leisure
    - At this point, we now have a sense based on the supplied workload information 
    - Of what kind of total cost of ownership we will be looking at over time, by migrating on-premises workloads into the Azure cloud


Configure Billing Alerts
  - Some Azure services like Managed Azure SQL databases can cost a lot of money if you keep them running all month
    - What we can do then is configure billing alerts so that when the amount of our bill gets to a certain point
    - Somebody gets notified before it gets too out of control
    - To set this up the first thing we are going to do here in the Azure portal is to search for our subscriptions then select our subscription
  - On the right, we are going to click Manage which opens up another browser window
    - This has taken us to a location where we can actually manage the details related to that specific subscription, including billing alerts
  - If you havve not already enabled alerts
    - You can go to preview features where you'll see preview features including the Billing Alert Service
    - If you've not signed up for, you can go ahead and sign up for
    - We are just going to go back into my subscription and click on Alerts
    - Any existing alerts that might have been created will be shown but we would click Add alert here to add a new one
  - Here, we are going to call this alert name Too much and when the billing total is at $500 spent
    - Depending on your account and your subscription, the unit of measurement, or the currency, will vary here, in my case it's US dollars
    - We can specify an email address here.
  - We can specify an email recipient or two that will get a notification when we've got to that point
    - Then go ahead and click Save so you can add a billing alert to responsibly manage your monthly Azure charges


Azure Support Plans
  - Microsoft Azure support plans are useful because they can provide your organization with help 
    - When certain problems arise with the use of Azure cloud computing services
    - And we can breakdown the support plans into two general categories
    - They would be development versus production workloads
    - Items that factor into which support plan you might select for your organization would include the degree of technical support, the response time.
  - Do we have to wait one week or one hour to get a response when we have an issue? 
    - Then, operations support on the planning and the use of Azure services, and training options
    - The Azure support plans begin with Basic, followed by Developer, followed by Standard, after which we have Professional Direct, and finally, Premier
  - What happens is with each level of support, so starting with Basic all the way down to Premier, each plan gets successfully more expensive
    - That's because more support options are made available
    - For example, with the Azure Basic support plan, there is no tech support
    - If all you're doing is evaluating Azure, or you have technicians that are very used to working in Azure already for a testing environment
    - You might even stick with Basic if you don't need any support at all.
  - Then with the Developer Azure support plan, tech support is made available during business hours
    - But compare that to Standard, where there is 24/7 tech support
    - And even as quick as one hour response times for any issues that might pop up
    - Professional Direct is also something that's available if you need Azure technicians to help you with your planning of your Azure architecture
    - Finally, we've got Premier, Premier also allocates a designated Azure IT technician from Microsoft when you have incidents


Submit an Azure Support Ticket
  - There isn't an infinite amount of resources available at least by default to Azure cloud customers
    - We've pulled up the Azure subscription limits and quotas document
    - We can see that there are limits for example the number of virtual machine course per subscription per region
  - Or things like the amount of storage account per region per subscription
    - If you plan on potentially exceeding these, then you can ask for an increase beyond the default limit
    - We can do that here in the Azure portal, by going to our question mark help icon in the bar
    - And choosing Help and Support where we can submit a support request
  - Of course, you could also submit a support request for numerous other reasons, so is it related to Azure?
    - Yes, and here it could be related to billing 
    - Or what we're just talking about now service and subscription limits
    - Or subscription management, or it could be a technical question or issue.
  - Here we'll choose service and subscription limits and specifically 
    - For example say I'm interested in going beyond the 200 storage account quota per region per subscription
    - We will choose storage quota and we'll click the Next button at the bottom, we'll then have to provide details
  - We will just fill in some sample text at this point
    - We could even upload a file perhaps a screenshot related to something that we have encountered or plan on doing
    - Then down below we can determine what the severity is to the organization, the preferred contact method
    - We can also determine, notice that when we choose Phone as well we can determine that same information
  - The response hours here is set to business hours but that will vary depending on your support plan in Azure 
    - And the language that we wish to be contacted in
    - As we go down below, there's more contact information that can be specified
    - Once we filled all this in, we can see that we will have support requests that will show up under the All support requests view
    - Of course, we haven't submitted any specifically recently, so we are not going to see any new ones
    - But here we can take a look at the time frame and we can also check the status of any support requests that might have been submitted in the past
  - Having problems in Azure is a rarity, so it shouldn't be often that you need to submit an Azure support request ticket
    - But if you do need to do it, you now know how to do it through the portal.
