                    Course Notes Part 50


Block Public SSH and RDP Traffic (Cont)
  - For example, we've got a port 22 rule from any source that's allowed to get to any destination on TCP port 22, which is SSH
    - However, do we really want to allow that coming in? The answer is no
    - At the same time, we really don't need a public IP address if that's the sole purpose of it for this Linux virtual machine
  - We should clean this up a little bit so go ahead and close out some of these things
    - We are going to go back to Networking, where notice we've got the public IP listed here for this Linux virtual machine
  - When I click the link, it takes me into that because it's a separate Azure resource, the public IP, click Dissociate
    - Now I'm going to do that so that it's not associated any longer with the Linux virtual machine
  - If this public IP address resource isn't needed for anything else, we can even go ahead and delete the resource
    - It's always a good idea to delete Azure resources that you are certain you no longer need
    - Because then you're not incurring any additional charges, plus it just makes management of your Azure resources a little bit more streamlined
  - At the same time, I'm going to close out of that and go back to the Networking part of the properties blade for my Linux virtual machine
    - Because I'm interested in looking at the network security groups here so we've got a couple of network security groups
  - Remember, if we click on Effective security rules, if the VM's running
    - We'll see all effective security rules that apply to this particular virtual machine at this point in time
    - Here, we've got a network security group for the VM itself and then another one for a subnet
    - If we click on these links, notice we can see where the rules comes from
    - And so the Port_22 item is from the eastlinuxvm1-nsg, or network security group
    - We are going to go ahead and click on that so we can look at the inbound rules
  - Here is the Port_22 rule, we are going to go ahead and select that and delete the rule, why?
    - Because we don't need it. What we're going to be doing is connecting our on-premises station through a VPN to Azure
    - That's called a point to site VPN. After which, we can then connect to the private IP of the virtual machine.
  - Go ahead and close out of this network security group, we can see the rule's been removed
    - Just close the network interface actually and we've got all kinds of levels of resources we're into
    - Now let's go back to the overview for the VM itself
    - What we're going to be interested in then is noting that we no longer have a public IP address
    - If we go ahead and click on Networking on the left, we can see the private IP for this host.
  - So the private IP then is going to go ahead and allow us to make a connection to that host once we have VPNed into the network environment
    - Bear in mind that the default rule here, AllowVnetInbound will allow connectivity for resources on the VNET to resources in that same VNET
    - Which is like our Linux virtual machine
    - We could go ahead and follow this practice and apply it to all the virtual machines that we don't want publicly accessible for remote management purposes


Azure Government Services
  - Cloud computing with Azure presents a lot of interesting opportunities, not only for private sector enterprises, but also for the US government.
  - Azure Government Services provides specific Azure services for US government agencies, such as the Department of Defense or DoD
    - Federal agencies, state agencies, and even municipal agencies
    - With Azure Government Services, one consideration is a hybrid cloud, where there are some government agency data centers
    - That are able to be extended into the Azure cloud.
  - So that some services and data reside in the cloud and are replicated from on premises, either for safe keeping or for high availability
    - Also Azure Government Services uses dedicated data centers located throughout the United States, although those locations are not disclosed
    - There are many different types of connected devices that can be related to government use of the Azure government cloud
      - Such as traffic control systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning for government agency facilities
  - Also, entire smart cities and military sites. With Azure Government Services
    - We need to think about differences between how we would configure IT systems and services on premises versus the cloud
    - Because while there are a lot of similarities, it's not done in exactly the same manner
    - One reason for this is shared responsibility, because when we use cloud computing
    - Depending on exactly what we're deploying into the cloud, such as an infrastructure as a service virtual machine
  - Means that some of the underlying responsibility such as for the hypervisor that hosts our virtual machine 
    - Would be the responsibility of Microsoft in the Azure cloud
    - But the maintenance and the application of updates and configuration of the operating system in that virtual machine
    - In this case, would be the responsibility of us, the cloud consumer
  - Things like DNS name resolution, bear in mind, set as a default Azure-provided DNS
    - Which means that if we want to use our own DNS servers, that has to be a conscious decision, and that's a configuration we'd have to make
  - Also, virtual network IP addresses that are available 
    - Bear in mind that when you might be configuring a government agency network on premises and assigning IP address ranges
    - You will have more IP addresses available for your use than you might in the Azure cloud, because Azure reserves IP addresses
    - As seen here, when we are adding a subnet to a Microsoft Azure virtual network, notice that there are five Azure reserved addresses that are allocated
  - That means within your IP address range for the subnet, that's five IP addresses that you cannot use
    - That's an important consideration, Azure Government Secret is a part of the Azure government cloud that adheres to Department of Defense Impact Level 5
    - Which deals with controlled yet unclassified information, otherwise called CUI
    - It's also compliant with the use of National Security Systems or NSS
  - This is any type of computing system that processes data that meets a certain level of security
    - This is deemed acceptable for use in this context for US government use
    - Also, Azure Government Secret uses dedicated infrastructure so that we've got a physical separation between cloud tenants
    - Connectivity is through the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network, otherwise called NIPRNet
    - NIPRNet is a private network that's used for the sharing of information that's considered unclassified for Azure government use


Azure Germany Services
  - Azure Germany services, as the name implies, relates to the use of Azure cloud services in the German environment
    - This means that workloads need to run in German data centers. And the data also needs to reside in German data centers
    - This means that we need to have appointed a German data trustee that is responsible for the oversight of these data centers in Germany
  - This is done specifically by T-Systems International, there are only two Azure German regions
    - Replication occurs between these regions for high availability like it would between any other regions around the world for Azure
    - The two regions are Germany Central and Germany Northeast.
  - When you use Azure Germany services, you'll notice that some of the DNS suffixes are different 
    - Than what you might be used to when you use Azure outside of Germany
    - For example, when we're using Azure SQL we would have a DNS suffix by default that ends in .database.cloudapi.de
    - Whereas outside of Germany, normally that SQL suffix for DNS would be .database.windows.net
    - You'll see some of those changes with a variety of different Azure services that use DNS suffixes
  - In Azure Germany services, ExpressRoute circuits are supported, but only for Azure not for Office 365
    - ExpressRoute circuits use a local point of presence so that organizations
    - Or in some cases government agencies, can have a dedicated network circuit or link straight from their data center 
    - Directly into the Azure cloud without traversing the Internet
  - Azure Active Directory is supported with Azure Germany services, however, you can't use a standard Microsoft account sign-in for Azure
    - Where that will work outside of Azure Germany, it does not work with Azure Germany services


View Azure PCI DSS Compliance
  - PCI DSS is a security standard that applies to organizations that deal with cardholder data, things like credit cards and debit cards
    - It's a series of security controls that should be put in place to ensure the safeguarding of that type of data
    - In Azure, we have a way to view our compliance based on our current configuration of our Azure resources
    - While it's not complete and doesn't give us a 100% assurance that we are complying, it certainly a very good starting point
  - To get to this, the first thing we'll do here in the Azure Portal is go to the Security Center down at the bottom of the left-hand navigator.
    - Then in the properties blade for the Security Center, there's something you'll see under policy and compliance called Regulatory compliance
    - Which is currently a preview feature so click on it
    - Oveer on the right, we can see we've got number of different standards bodies here such as ISO 27001, SOC TSP, and of course, what we're looking for PCI DSS
    - It says that out of 30 past controls, we've got 30
    - However, that doesn't mean we are 100% compliant with what we should be in a PCI DSS context if we're dealing with cardholder data
    - So I'm going to click the link down below for PCI DSS 3.2 which gives us a bit more detail
    - We are going to choose the checkbox for expand all compliance controls
