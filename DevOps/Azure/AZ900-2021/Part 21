Cloud Computing Roles
  - There are a number of definable roles when it comes to a cloud computing ecosystem. 
    - The first role is the cloud service provider, otherwise called as CSP
    - Where they bear much of the responsibility for making sure that the underlying infrastructure supporting cloud services remains up and running
    - And that things perform well according to SLAs for cloud services
    - At the CSP level, they have the ultimate configuration flexibility because they control the actual physical hardware
      - the physical servers, the physical storage arrays, the physical network switches and routers, and so on in their data centers
  - Cloud consumers also called cloud customers or cloud tenants, have a multitude of different cloud models they can work with in terms of offerings
    - So developers, for example, will be interested in platform as a service or PaaS, which would be useful for developing custom apps
    - The cloud service provider has offerings that facilitate those tasks
    - Next, we have common office staff or end users that would be interested primarily in Software as a Service or SaaS
    - For example, using cloud-based email or office productivity tools like spreadsheets and word processors, all in the cloud
    - In other words, having that software delivered over a network.
  - At the IT level, then we have Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS
    - This would be for cloud administrators or cloud technicians that would be responsible for determining which cloud services need to be deployed
    - And then deploying and managing those cloud services
    - Things like virtual machines or applications, custom applications, running in the cloud
    - And allocating storage and controlling access to all of those cloud resources, that's really part of the IT support team's responsibilities.
  - Other roles include the Cloud Service Brokerage or the CSB
    - This can be thought of as similar to a mortgage broker
    - It is an intermediary that has the ability to look at your computing needs as it pertains to the cloud 
    - Then going out and negotiating and finding the best cloud service provider that meets those needs
    - Cloud architects are the technicians that will design your organization-specific use of cloud services to achieve organizational objectives
    - Cloud auditors are those people that will audit the usage of cloud activities to ensure things like legal and regulatory compliance
      - and also to ensure peak optimum efficiency.
  - Having things running smoothly at an efficient cost level then there are cloud carriers
    - Cloud carriers come in a few different forms, the most common of which, when it comes to public cloud service providers are internet service providers
    - They are the cloud carriers that provide the network link between an on premises network or an individual customer to the cloud provider
    - Other types of cloud carriers would also include local telco or cable companies
    - Anyone that can provide a dedicated network circuit were available in different regions around the world
    - From an on premises network directly to the cloud without traversing the internet, that would be another example of a cloud carrier role.


On-premise vs. Cloud
  - To further illustrate the benefits of cloud computing, sometimes it's important to compare it against the equivalent on-premises solutions
  - The first thing to consider is that when you run things on-premises
    - Because it's running on your equipment and everything is your responsibility
    - That also means by extension, you have more configuration control
    - There is also more flexibility in how that IT solution is configured and how it's maintained over time
    - Then there is the issue of hardware acquisition. So if you need to support a new line of business app, for example, on-premises
    - You need to make sure you have the underlying hardware to support it
    - Whether that includes servers, whether that includes network routing equipment or switches, storage arrays, and so on.
  - Which means it costs money, it costs more to acquire all of this hardware than it would to simply rent it or use it on an as needed basis in the cloud
    - It also means waiting for it to arrive
    - If you place an order for hardware, it takes time for it to be shipped to your on-premises network or data center
    - The other consideration is software as you also need to acquire software that you're going to use on-premises
    - Not only that, but you also need to license it. Now the same thing would be true in the cloud, the difference being it's a little easier in the cloud.
  - Even to the point where you can bring your own existing licenses that you might have already previously acquired
    - Then reuse them in the cloud, when you adopt the cloud
    - With on-premises IT solutions, you also have the responsibility of ongoing management
    - That's the responsibility of the organization, that owns that infrastructure
    - Normal administration, such as making sure that backups occur
    - Making sure that user accounts are created for newly hired employees, applying updates and so on
    - That's all the responsibility of the IT team on-premises
    - Deploying resources on-premises, such as a new application, usually involves the on-premises IT team and the help desk, and maybe even some training staff.
  - In the cloud, often new software that is made available is simply available to use over the network immediately
    - There's no need to deploy it in most cases, it is most cases because it is depending on what types of solutions you're using in the cloud
    - There still might be some software components you need to download and install on user devices
    - Whether that device is a smartphone, or a laptop or a desktop
    - Then there is the cost factor, with on-premises, there are ongoing costs related to acquiring hardware such as server hardware
    - Which is really considered a capital expenditure, otherwise shortened to CAPEX
    - Then there's the power consumption, for all of the IT infrastructure equipment.
  - There is a need to pay the power bill and the heating and cooling bills as well
    - Then there's the amount of real estate or the space that you need to accommodate all of this equipment
    - In a server room or even in your own on-premises data center
    - In the cloud, you only pay for the resources that you use, kind of like electricity, or water
    - It's metered based on your consumption, you pay a certain amount
    - That's an operational expense otherwise shortened to OPEX so the prices will adjust depending on how much you consume.
  - That's why it's important in the cloud, to ensure when you're finished with something
    - Such as a virtual machine or database that was used for testing, that you immediately shut it down, and if you don't need it in the future, delete it. 
    - Otherwise leaving things running means incurring unnecessary charges
    - Then there's the control of things like data and the configuration of your IT solutions
    - With on-premises you have full control of every aspect of the data life cycle. From its creation, its storage, it's sharing
    - You also have full configuration control of your IT solutions
    - In the cloud, in some cases, data ownership could be questionable
    - Especially where you start replicating cloud stored data to alternate regions around the world.
  - Where that data could be subject to the laws within the jurisdiction that the data center falls within
    - Of course in the cloud we have limited configuration control
    - Some of the responsibility for the underlying IT infrastructure falls upon the cloud service provider
    - Certainly at the hardware level all of the responsibility falls on the cloud service provider
    - When comparing on-premises computing to cloud computing, security always comes up
    - ith on-premises environments, you might have sensitive data or systems that are highly classified, that require a high level of privacy.
  - That could be related to government agencies, including military and law enforcement, or banking
    - However, in the cloud, there is a potential for a security breach, just as there is on-premises
    - One of the arguments that is often heard is that public cloud service providers are more of a target
    - They're centralized target where there are multiple customers or tenants storing potentially sensitive data
    - Which you could also liken to saying, you shouldn't store your money in a bank.
  - Because the bank stores money for a lot of customers, it's a larger target
    - Public cloud service providers are of course in the business of earning a profit
    - It's very bad for business if there are security breaches
    - So the chances are, public cloud providers probably have much more security in place than most private sector organizations would be able to afford
    - There could be public records, intellectual property, whether it's on-premises or in the cloud, that needs to be protected
    - We want to move away from a statement as simple as saying, that security is not as strong in the cloud for data as it would be on-premises.
  - That's definitely not the case, then there's compliance as we have to think about on-premises compliance with regulations and laws
    - Especially as it applies to sensitive data, in the cloud the same thing is really true
    - What to look for with cloud service providers is what is relevant to your organization in the type of data that it will be dealing with
    - You might look at legislative acts such as HIPAA for the protection of medical information
    - Or GDPR for the protection of European Union citizen data, or PCI DSS for the protection of credit card holder information.
