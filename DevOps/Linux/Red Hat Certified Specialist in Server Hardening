  - 

4 - Why Server Hardening?
The internet was not designed for security
  - Any security features have been applied later
Within a short time of a new server being available on the internet it will be tested for vulnerabilities
  - This means that you should not have any right from the start
There is a duty of care for your organisation to ensure that it is as secure as possible from unauthorised access
There have been well publicised breaches in large and small companies
  - Non-profits as well as home systems are also targets
The attack tools of today are easy to obtain and easy to use
There are controls that you will need to have covering Administrative, Physical and Technical



                    Section 2 - Identify Common Red Hat Vulnerabilities and Exposures
1 - The CIA Model
The standard security model is the CIA model
  - Confidentiality which means information should only be available to pre-defined users
  - Integrity because unauthorised users should not be able to change or destroy any information
  - Availability which refers to having information available to authorised users when needed
SE Linux is an enhanement to the Linux Kernel
  - The course will not cover much as it is focused on the server hardening
There are a number of resources available for keeping up to data with issues
  - Red Hat security portal
    - https://access.redhat.com/security/
    - Red Hat customers can set up alerts on this portal for security issues
  - Mitre CVE (not Red Hat specific) 
    - https://cve.mitre.org
  - NIST NVD (not Red Hat specific) 
    - https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard

2 - Updating Systems



                    Section 3 - Verify Package Security and Validity
1 - Verifying Packages - Yum

2 - Installing and Verifying Packages with RPM



                    Section 4 - Identify and Employ Standards-based Practices
1 - Common Standards
There are common standards that should be implemented in organisations
  - Physical Protection
    - There should be a limit on how many people can physically interact with hardware
    - Where there is physical access there should be also BIOS password protection
    - USB keys can be used as attack platforms so their use should be restricted
    - No booting from alternate media eg CD 
  - Virtual/Server Partitions
    - Where possible run the latest version of the OS
    - Servers should be partitioned eg /var, /var/log etc
  - Firewalls installed and configured
    - These can be either network or server based
    - Many companies do not use server based firewalls
  - The sticky bit should be set on all directories that are world writable
  - Register servers with Red Hat Satellite for patching
  - Ensure that you have a Red Hat GPG and that it is enabled
  - Remove legacy services, this may not be possible for 100% of services but as much as possible is recommended
  - Disable any unneeded/unused services this reduces the attack surface of the system
  - Set SSH protocol to 2 and SSH loglevel to info
  - Disable remote root login
  - Set SSH permit empty passwords to no
  - Use software such as AIDE or OSSEC
  - Configure and make use of SE-Linux, this can be difficult to use
  - Setup banner notices for system logins or access, this maybe a legal requirement in some jurisdictions
  - Secure software eg Apache and use secure versions of software if possible eg SFTP instead of FTP
  - Use common tools to run vulnerability assessments, do not do this on a production server
