Docker and Containers are likely to be a large part of all IT professionals future
This is a follow on to the Docker And Containers Big Picture course

The course uses the Docker Version 1.12

                    
                    Section 3 - Installing Docker
1 - Module Intro
The module shows how to install docker
  - The course will explain some of the behind the scenes information
Docker has a multitude of installation options 
  - Multiple OS'es
  - Cloud Infrastructre
  - On Premises installation
  - Many different installation types
Things in the tech world change fast so some of the course maybe different
To install
  - Ensure hyper-v is installed/enabled
  - https://www.docker.com/docker-windows
  - Use the package to install and accept license agreement

2 - Docker For Windows
The version targeted in the course is Windows 10 64 bit
The pre-requisites
  - Windows 10 64 bit
  - As clean an installation as possible
  - The use cases are for testing dev and learning docker
  - Although it is for windows it runs on a hyper-v vm running linux
  - To check docker is installed, at the command line
    - docker version

3 - Docker For Mac
Installation of Docker on Mac Sytems

4 - Installing Docker On Windows Server 2016

5 - Installing Docker On Linux

6 - Module Summary
A quick summary of the material that was covered in the section


                    Section 4 - Working With Containers
1 - Whats A Container
Containers differ from Virtual Machines
  - Virtual Machines use a hypervisor to generate a divide resources into virtual machines
  - Containers divide server resources
    - This means that every container gets its own pid1 and root file system
    - They are much more light weight then VM's

2 - The 'Docker run ' Command
Using a linux machine for the example
  - This is not important to how docker operates
  - To check docker version
    - docker version        // You may need to use sudo
    - You should get both the client and server version info depending on installation
  - docker info
    - This will give information on everything from containers, run states to OS version
  - docker run hello-world
    - This creates a hello-world container and runs it
    - This is a temporary type of container as it runs and exits
  - docker ps
    - This shows if there are any docker containers running
    - Adding the -a option will show if there are any that recently exited
  - docker images
    - Shows a list of existing images
    - These are images that are local
