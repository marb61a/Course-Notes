Combining Data
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-shape-and-combine-data
  - Where tables have the same structure then you may need to append them into a single query

Pivot Tables
  - https://databear.com/power-bi-pivot-and-unpivot-columns/#:~:text=To%20do%20this%20go%20into,following%20pivoted%20result%20will%20appear
  - You may need to use aggregate functions on some columns where there are more values then other columns
    - If there are duplicate value that you do not wish to aggregate that can be selected from the pivot column
    - Other values can be summed where needed so that there are not errors when comparing columns
 
Data Origin
  - There maybe times where you need to update the data sources you use in a model
  - Go to Home> Data source settings, it is possible to update the origin of the data for the whole model you are working on
 
Cell Dates
  - If there are null values in previous date cells in a column
    - Use the Fill, and then Down functionality
    - The Fill function filled the values by replacing the null values with the value above

Dataset Profile
  - https://radacad.com/create-a-profiling-report-in-power-bi-give-the-end-user-information-about-the-data
  - Use Power Query to check the data profiling functionalities
  - Select the Column Profiling and Quality and Distribution details in the View tab of the Power Query Editor of Power BI Desktop
  
Combining Data from different tables
  - Where there are additional rows of data that youâ€™d like to add to an existing query, you need to append the query
  - https://radacad.com/append-vs-merge-in-power-bi-and-power-query

Importing a sample of a larger table
  - Use the query editor and filter to get the desired data subset
  - Use select and where within the query editor
  
Removing characters
  - If you want to remove for example numbers from a list eg 001 - ABC, 002 - BCD etc
  - Use the trim after delimiter functionality
  - Simply go to Extract menu, click Text After Delimiter, set the delimiter which in this case is -
 
Data Transformations
  - If a data model presents a huge list of queries that make it difficult to organize the transformation steps
  - Create a group of queries to classify the data-transformations, there are benfits to this approach

Replacing Column values using M
  - When trying to replace column values in a table eg Replace 'Null' with 'No Value'
  - Use the Table.ReplaceValue function
  - There are differences between this and Text.Replace
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/table-replacevalue

Conditional Columns
  - A conditional column is a column based on a condition imposed on an existing column
    - This is something similar to replacing column values above but instead of replacing the values in the column
    - It changes the value in another column hence the conditional column name
  - https://radacad.com/conditional-column-in-power-bi-using-power-query-you-can-do-anything

Improving Dataset Performance
  - Having both dates and times in the one column can cause performance issues on big datasets
  - Separating them out maybe the best way to improve performance
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-data/8-performance-issues
 
Minimising Model size
  - When working with larger datasets there maybe a need to minimise the model size
  - This is where a the GroupBy functionality comes in
  - GroupBy allows for summarising which will have a reducing effect on the number of rows
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-common-query-tasks#group-rowshttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/group-by

Importing Multiple files to a single table
  - Add a folder data source and use the Combine Files command.
