2 - Installing And Setting Up The Working Environment
The first tool to install is Virtual Box for creating Virtual Machines
Then Vagrant will be installed and configured to launch the development infrastructure
  - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
  - The course will consist of 1 Puppet Master & 2 Puppet Agent Nodes
    - The agents will be CentOS and Ubuntu
  - To verify Vagrant installation
    - At the command line type -- vagrant version
  - To initialise a Vagrant configuration file, 
    - vagrant init              // This will place a file into your directory
  Example Configuration file
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config| 
      // Vagrant will need to be told which provider is used to provide virtual machines
      config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|  
        v.memory = 2048
        v.cpus = 2
      end
      // Defining what OS the puppetmaster will be running
      config.vm.define "puppetmaster" do |pm|
        pm.vm.box = "centos/7"
        pm.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
        pm.vm.hostname = "puppetmaster"
      end
      config.vm.define "puppet-agent-centos" do |pac|
        pac.vm.box = "centos/7"
        pac.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.11"
        pac.vm.hostname = "centos-agent"
      end
      config.vm.define "puppet-agent-ubuntu" do |pau|
        pau.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
        pau.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.12"
        pau.vm.hostname = "ubuntu-agent"
      end
    end
  To check the status
    - vagrant status
