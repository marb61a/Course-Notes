                    SDET/Test Architect Essentials -Road to Full stack QA 
                    Course Notes Part 1


Road Map to become SDET- Course Intro
What is this course about? Course FAQ's
  - Automation is not limited to automating API and Web testcases
  - Automation may be reuired in different corners of software to avoid manual effort
  - This is where SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) / Test Architect posisitions came into existence
  - SDET is not a specified syllabus, it is journey of keeping updated with technologies
  - The course is designed to bridge the gap from QA automation engineer to SDET
    - This is done by teaching the esssential skill set required in industry to fulfill the SDET position
  - The course is designed by understanding what companies are doing with the SDET position
  - There are some prerequisites for the course
    - Students should be familiar with Core Java and Selenium\TestNG

Converting JDBC Results into Java object with POJO classes
Problem Statement, Deciding which approach to solve it
  - The section will take an example problem statement
  - Then the problem will be worked through to see where automation can be used to solve the problem
  - The sample problem is 
    - A bookstore company which sells its books online
    - There is a database which stores information about books, purchasers information etc
      - This can be a problem if there are a lot of database tranactions per day
    - The first step in a solution is to add a second region specific database
      - This mean having all customers in Asia for example on the second database
      - This is populated by running batch jobs on the main database at certain time and transfering Asia based purchases
      - This will necessitate having a connection between the databases
    - Ths can create a problem as there will need to be testing
      - This will test whether the information has been stored properly on the second database
    -
