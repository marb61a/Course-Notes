                    Azure Machine Learning using Cognitive Services 
                    Course Notes Part 1


Section 1: Intro to Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning
  - Making machines more intelligent
    - Not just executing pre-programmed tasks, mmimicing human behaviour and learning for themselves
  - How to make machines more intelligent
    - There are a lot of ways divided into 2 categories
      - Supervised Learning
        - Only one part of the data is provided eg 80%
        - This trains only the provided data the rest is to be provided by how well the AI learning has went (20%)
      - Unsupervised Learning
        - This will hand over 100% of available data to the model to be trained
Knowing How To Code
  - Will make the course easier
  - Azure will offer apps as REST services
  - Powerful models can be created
  - The course will teach the specifics
  - The course is structured in a per-service way so that if certain services are of interest the section can be done out of order

Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning
  -

Examples Of Apps That Use Machine Learning
  - Autocompletion in search engines eg Google
    - This basis searching not only on past searches but on what searches are linked
  - Photos App on iOS
    - This will search for photos which may matcha search term eg Dog will show images with dogs even if not in the name
