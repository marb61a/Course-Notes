                    Learn Protractor(Angular Testing) from scratch +Framework 
                    Course Notes Part 1


Introduction
Understand the importance of Protractor
  - Protractor is an end to end testing framework for Angular and Angular JS application
  - Webdriver + Angular support = Protractor
  - Protractor is the only stable frame work to automate testing of Angular Apps
    - It is maintained by the team behind Angular
  - It is a NodeJS program that is built on top of WebDriver JS
  - This means that it uses JavaScript as its core language to develop tests
  - Students are not required to have that much knowledge of JavaScript 
  - There are several tools that are used in the course which are
    - JavaScript, Jasmine, NodeJS, Protractor API
  - The expected outcomes for students are
    - Understannding NodeJS to a reasonable level
    - Complete understanding of the Protractor API
    - Understand the Jasmine unit testing framework
    - Develop a JS testing framework from scratch
      - Including logs, config files, code optimisation and Jenkins etc
    - Git/Github commands

Typescript Addition to the Course
  - Typescript is not a new language in and of itself
  - It is a superset of JavaScript
    - TypeScript is JavaScript with stronger typing added
    - TypeScript compiles to JavaScript
  - It is not important to the Protractor API whether or not JS or TS is used
    - The differences in syntax arise when building the testing framework
  - The course is designed to teach both TS and JS 
    - It has 2 different framework sections to section in which to explain
    - JavaScript section will be based on the Jasmine framework
    - The framework used in TypeScript is Cucumber 
  - There are only minor changes needed when writing in TS from JS
  - Students should learn based on what their project needs would be
  
Why NodeJS, Install Node
  - You will need to install NodeJS -- https://nodejs.org/en/
    - Some recommend using nvm for working with multiple Node versions
    - https://itnext.io/nvm-the-easiest-way-to-switch-node-js-environments-on-your-machine-in-a-flash-17babb7d5f1b
  - To install Protractor globally on the system
    - npm install -g protractor
  - To ensure that your protractor installation is working try 
    - protractor --version
  - The webdriver-manager tool is a helper tool to get an instance of Selenium Server running
    - Use the following command to download needed binary files
      - webdriver-manager update

Commands List
  - npm install -g protractor to install protractor
  - webdriver-manager update
    - This will need to be run prior to starting up Selenium
    - By default it will download the selenium server jar and chromedriver binary.
  - webdriver manager start
    - This starts up the Selenium server
    - By default it will run at http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.
