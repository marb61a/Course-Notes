  - Protractor is the only stable frame work to automate testing of Angular Apps
    - It is maintained by the team behind Angular

  - Typescript is not a new language in and of itself
  - It is a superset of JavaScript
    - TypeScript is JavaScript with stronger typing added
    - TypeScript compiles to JavaScript
  - It is not important to the Protractor API whether or not JS or TS is used
