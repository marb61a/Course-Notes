Getting started with Protractor

Introduction to Jasmine and its Terminologies
  - https://jasmine.github.io/
  - Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JS
  - Protractor uses Jasmine to build test cases
  - There are 2 main parts of Jasmine terminology to understand 'it' and 'describe'
    - it -- A test case
    - describe -- Test suite
      - A describe can contain multiple test cases
    - Test files are called a spec, this is Jasmine terminology
    - The it and describe are mandatory in specs
  - The configuration file is normally known as a driver file
    - This is written in JavaScript and contains all spec file names
    - This is similar to Java's TestNG xml file
  - In Eclipse use the add js file option
  - Example Syntax
    describe('Beginning Protractor', function() {
      it('Open Angular site', function(){
      
      })
      it('Close browser', function(){
      
      })
    })
