                    Cypress-Modern Automation Testing from Scratch + Framework 
                    Course Notes Part 1


Introduction to Cypress
 What is Cypress? And why it is future of Automation
  - Cypress is a next generation front end Automation testing tool built for the modern web applications
  - Cypress autmatically waits for commands or assertions
    - This saves going through the issues known as async hell
  - It has the ability to test Edge Testcases by Mocking the server response
  - Cypress will take snapshots as test are run
    - Hovering over the commands in the command log will whow exactly what happend during each command
  - It has the ability to edge testcases by mocking server responses
  - Cypress delivers more reliable, faster and consistent tests than other tools
    - This is because of its internal architecture
  - Videos of tests being executed are available from the dashboard
  - It is built on NodeJS and comes in an npm module
    - It uses JavaScript for writing tests but 90% of coding can be done using Cypress commands
    - You should use the NPM website for downloading the package
  - It comes bundled with JQuery and inherits many of that frameworks methods for UI component identification

Understand Cypress Architecture and its benefits
  - Tools like Selenium operate outside of the browser
    - This then sends remote commands across the network
  - The Cypress engine operates within the browser
    - This allows Cypress to listen and modify behaviour at run time
    - It manipulates the DOM and alters network requests and responses on the fly
  - Cypress opens the doors to a new kind of testing
  - The browsers supported are Chrome, Firefox, Electron and under construction IE
  - The 2 tools looked at in the course are Test Runner and Dashboard Service

Course syllabus walkthrough
  - The expected course outcomes are
    - Students will be able to automate any web app using Cypress
    - Understanding how Cypress is unique and able to build stable tests using JQuery
