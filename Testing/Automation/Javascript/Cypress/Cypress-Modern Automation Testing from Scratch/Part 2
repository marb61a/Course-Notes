                    Cypress-Modern Automation Testing from Scratch + Framework 
                    Course Notes Part 2


Introduction to Cypress Test Runner and command line features
What is Cypress TestRunner
  - After installation you can run Cypress by typing node_modules/.bin/cypress open
    - To avoid having to run the long command to open Cypress it can be aliased in package.json
      - "scripts" : {
        "cypress": "cypress open"
      }
  - You must be in this directory to run Cypress commands
  - Initial opening of Cypress may be slow
    - After this though Cypress will run very quickly though tests
  - Opening Cypress will add some example tests upon first opening
  - Opening Cypress opens the test runner tool with a list of the sample tests generated automatically
  - Each of these tests can be run simply by clicking on them
  - Running the tests will generate a new window with 2 tabs
    - On the left hand side is the log window
    - On the right hand side is the execution window

Build a Cypress test and run from TestRunner
  - Creating a sample test and understanding the principles behind it
  - It may be a good idea to delete sample tests to avoid confusion with your own tests
  - When writing tests you will need to follow the standards of at least 1 JS testing framework
    - Example frameworks are Jasmine and Mocha
    - Mocha is recommended and comes packed with Cypress to avoid needing to install
    - The expect parts of tests come from the Chai testing framework
  - This is because although Cypress automates tests you will need them properly constructed
  Example Syntax
  // Cypress makes the cy object available globally
  describe("My First Test Suite", function(){
    it("My Furst Test Case", function(){
      cy.visit("www.url");
    })
  })
