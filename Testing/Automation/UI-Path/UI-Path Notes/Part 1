                    Learn UiPath PRA Automation from Scratch to Advanced Level 
                    Course Notes Part 1

Introduction of RPA
Introduction to RPA and UIPath
  - RPA is software based robotics that emulates work that people do
  - RPA is software based not the hardware robots for automation
  - RPA is a configurable software tool that uses business rules and sequences of actions to automatically complete processes
    - This can be any type of application and is done the same way a person would do them
    - People are need to help with exception management
  - Configurable Software is out of the box software that comes with some built in functionality
  - Business Rules are the decision criteria or constraints that determine how a process is to be executed
  - Sequences of actions are a series of steps taken to complete actions across multiple systems 
  - Different tasks can go from very simple to highly complex
    - These can be HR management of absences or balancing invoices
  - Automatic means that the tasks are done independently
  - RPA operates on the front end of applications, similar to the way that people use them
  - The course is for multiple type of professionals such as
    - Executives, IT specialists, HR staff and Operations Leaders
  - The course will cover 
    - Definition and benefits of RPA
    - How to make well designed solutions
    - Lessons learned and best practices
  - Some of the learnings from the course are
    - RPA, both the basics and the big picture
    - Benefits and best practices
    - Process selection and ensuring a successful RPA initiative
      - Processes should be something that is repeated
  - Technologies that can be used in RPA include
    - Desktop Automation, Web Automation, Excel Automation, Screen Scraping and more
  
  UIPath Concepts
    - Activities
      - An activity in UIPath is a small task or action eg pressing a button
    - Sequences
      - A sequence is a meaningful combination of activities to make a sequence
    - There are 3 main parts of UIPath
    - UIPath Studio is a developer are where process modelling development take place
      - It is a visual based process designer
      - Activities can be dragged and dropped
      - There is an advanced recorder built in for use with multiple platforms
      - The studio designer is integrated with Team Foundation Server
    - Orchestrator is a centralised area where there is a dashboard and management and control of UIPath process
      - Orchestrator is a server based application that lets you orchestrate your Robots, hence the name Orchestrator. 
      - It runs on a server and connects to all robots within the network
      - It has a browser based interface that enables the orchestration and management of hundreds of Robots with a click
      - Orchestrator allows for managing the creation, monitoring, and deployment of resources in an environment
    - UIPath Robot is the agent which helps to execute the processes on the target machine and return results
    - UIPath RPA has several benefits
      - It increases business productivity as it automates extremely quickly
      - It is very cost effective due to IT resources being better utilised
      - It can improve customer expereience both internal and external
      - It is easy to use so automation can be done much quicker
      - UiPath deployment is possible in the cloud or on premise
    - Some UIPath Features are
      - Pre defined Activity Sets
        - UIPath includes 300+ inbuilt activities that cover the broad spectrum of process automation as well as application integration design works
          - There is also application integration design works
        - These activities are available in activities pane (as shown below), and they cover the bulk scope of design works 
          - This includes data extraction, data entry, and automation activities
      - Workflow Drag and Drop
        - A user can create visual process steps by simply dragging and dropping associated activities onto the graphical workspace
          - Then, they can convert those process steps into the visual workflow with the help of connection process
        - The alternative is to use the UIPath tool to create web or application based workflow using the recorder wizard
      - Record & Playback
        - A With this feature, the user can record the actions and create it as an automated process sequence, there are 4 types
          - Basic Recording --> Dedicated for automating single activities and widely used for the creation of the full selector of each activity
          - Web Recording --> Widely used for browsing and recording activities in the web pages
          - Desktop Recording --> Applicable for multiple actions as well as desktop applications
          - Citrix Recording --> This is extensively used for recording the keyboard, images and virtualized environment automation
      - Attended and Unattended Automation
        - UIPath is the only RPA tool that delivers both the attended and unattended automation in the enterprise RPA
