Flow diagrams
  - Editing flows using the edit button will bring up an edit page
  - This will show a flowchart like diagram
  - This will list all the steps in a flow including triggers, actions etc
  - Clicking each of the trigger boxes will show more information about the trigger
  - Triggers can also have their settings adjusted
  - Action boxes can also be click and have properties and settings adjusted

Editing your flow
  - Clicking into the email action box
  - In the user email field, clicking will bring up a hidden menu
    - This shows that user.email is the email of the user who triggered the flow
  - This variable can be used to send to a different email address
  - Errors can be checked in the flow checker section
  - To test click the test menu option
  - There are 2 different ways to test the flow after changes
    - The first option starts right from the very beginning again
    - The second option uses data from previous runs to run the test
    - This is now listed as manually and automatically
  - This is a very simple example of taking an existing flow and modifying to our needs
