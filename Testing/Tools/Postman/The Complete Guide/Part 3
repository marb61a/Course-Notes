                    Postman: The Complete Guide
                    Course Notes Part 3


Inspecting Responses
  - It is hugely important to understand what is returned in responses
  - HTTP responses have 3 main parts
    - Status codes eg 200 is ok, 404 is an error code
      - This is very important as it indicates whether a request is successful or failed
      - Failed responses must be understood to be able to fix issues
      - Alongside status codes are response times and response sizes
        - Time responses cover the entire process
    - Body
      - Almost all body options refer to how the response is shown
      - Pretty will format raw text into a much more readable format
      - Preview will render html which may help make errors clearer
      - You can send and download images and Postman will render images
    - Headers
      - These will be shown as key and value
      - For known headers Postman on hover will offer more information
      - You can save requests which is useful for documenting API's

Cookies
  - Cookies are technically just a header
  - When sending a request header from Postman a sent-cookie header is part of the request
  - Set-cookie instructs the browser to save the cookie
  - In order to see exiting cookies Postman has the cookie manager
    - This is on the far right hand side of the params bar
  - Selecting the cookies option will show cookies for any domain you have sent a request to
