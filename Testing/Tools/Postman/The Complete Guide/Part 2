                    Postman: The Complete Guide
                    Course Notes Part 2


Creating with API requests
Note about requestbin
  - The following lectures will be using an online tool called Requestbin.
    - http://requestbin.net/
  - It is recommended that students use this site
  - There is a caveat involved as this works differently than the videos show
  - There are also some other sites recommended
    - https://httpbin.org/
    - https://hookbin.com/
    - There is also an option to run an instance using Docker
      - https://github.com/Runscope/requestbin#deploy-your-own-instance-using-docker

Creating Requests
  - HTTP requests have 4 parts 
    - The request method such as GET, POST, PUT etc
    - The url where the request is to be sent
      - Using the requestbin site, you will need to create a requestbin
      - This will then generate a url which can be used for testing
        - In the video a paramterless request will return ok
        - Using now it will return an IP address
      - Reloading the postbin page will then show the methods involved and the headers as well as other information
      - After running postman with parameters in the request postbin will show the parameters as query string on the left of the page
    - Headers
    - Body
