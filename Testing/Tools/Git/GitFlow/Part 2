                    Using GitFlow
                    Course Notes Part 2


2 - Creating a Feature Branch
A demonstration of creating a feature branch
The people involved with the project are
  - The architect who creates the initial project
  - A developer who works on features, hot-fixes
  - A reviewer who reviews code
  - The build manager who manages the build server
  - In the exercise files there are folders for each of these
  - There is also an accompanyint GitHub repo
    - https://github.com/kevinrjones/PSGitFlow
    - There are 2 branches at this point called master and develop
This is the point at which the first feature is created
  - The developer's folder is empty so the repo will need to be cloned
  - To avoid cloning into a subdirectory add a period on to the clone command
    - git@github.com:kevinrjones/PSGitFlow.git .
    - This will be the master branch by default
    - There will need to be a new branch for the feature
      - git flow feature start 2-UsersCanAccessSingleEntries
        - This should be named properly around the feature
        - One good practice is name is so it can be used to refer back to issues around the feature
          - The isseus is created on the GitHub site and the last part of the name reflects the issue number and name
        - The github repo also needs to be initialised to use Git Flow
          - On the local repo -> git flow init
            - Accept all the defaults
            - At this point the new branch can be created
  - The changes will need to be added using the standard git process
