                    Using GitFlow
                    Course Notes Part 2


2 - Creating a Feature Branch
A demonstration of creating a feature branch
The people involved with the project are
  - The architect who creates the initial project
  - A developer who works on features, hot-fixes
  - A reviewer who reviews code
  - The build manager who manages the build server
  - In the exercise files there are folders for each of these
  - There is also an accompanyint GitHub repo
    - https://github.com/kevinrjones/PSGitFlow
    - There are 2 branches at this point called master and develop
This is the point at which the first feature is created
  - The developer's folder is empty so the repo will need to be cloned
  - To avoid cloning into a subdirectory add a period on to the clone command
    - git@github.com:kevinrjones/PSGitFlow.git .
    - This will be the master branch by default
    - There will need to be a new branch for the feature
      - git flow feature start 2-UsersCanAccessSingleEntries
        - This should be named properly around the feature
        - One good practice is name is so it can be used to refer back to issues around the feature
          - The isseus is created on the GitHub site and the last part of the name reflects the issue number and name
        - The github repo also needs to be initialised to use Git Flow
          - On the local repo -> git flow init
            - Accept all the defaults
            - At this point the new branch can be created
  - The changes will need to be added using the standard git process

3 - Publishing and Tracking a Feature Branch
  - Working on a branch in isolation and then needing to share to collaborate
  - The first thing that is needed is to get the feature branch on to the central repository
    - git flow feature publish <feature name>
    - After cretion there will be some messages and the local branch will track the remote branch
  - Once the branch has been published it can be pulled so as others can collaborate

                    Section 3 - Creating a Release Branch
1 - Introduction
Introduction to what the section will cover

2 - Creating a Release Branch
  - Example uses a person in charge of releases
  - To create a release
    - git flow release start <release name>
    - Git flow will then go through a process
    - The first step is to create a branch and check it out
    - The branch only exists on the local machine but will have to be shared
    - To share the branch that has been created above
      - git flow release publish
