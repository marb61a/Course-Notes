root commit - first commit of repository
rm -rf -- removes file\folder -r is recursively f is to force

  - http://www.initializr.com
Unzip the generated package
Go into the package folder
git init - creates a git folder 
git add . - adds the untracked files 
git commit -m "message" - Provides an inline commit message

Sample starter site already setup on Github
Click the fork button to make a copy of the repository into your personal space
There are a couple of clone options available to clone repository
  - Clone button
  - Copy the clone address
Clone Syntax
  - git clone url
Ensure that your username is in the url that has been cloned
cd into the folder that has been created by the git clone operation and there should be all the files that were present
