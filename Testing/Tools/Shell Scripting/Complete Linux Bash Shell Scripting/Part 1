                    Complete Linux Bash Shell Scripting with Real Life Examples
                    Course Notes 
                    Part 1

Syllabus
  - The syllabus will cover from setting up a lab through to real world scripts
  
Lab Setup
  - Using Virtualbox to install a Linux distro as a Virtual Machine
  - This is for users that run Windows as a host OS


Shell Scripting Basics
What is a Kernel
  - The kernel is the core of Linux
  - It is the interface between Hardware and Software
    - This means that the HW and SW can talk to each other
  - The kernel and a shell together is an OS

What is a Shell
  - For comprehension purposes it is similar to a container 
  - It is the interface between users and the Kernel and OS
  - The terminal in Linux is a shell
  - Many Linux distros use Bourne Again Shell (BASH)
  - To find your shell use the following command -> echo $0
  - To see what shells are available use the following command -> cat /etc/shells
  
What is Shell Scripting
  - At its most basic it is putting all of instructions into a container and then running the container to perform operations
  - This container is called a shell script and its extension is .sh

Types of Shells
  - There are different shells available for Linux systems
  - SH --> The original shell used on *nix
  - BASH --> Bourne Again Shell which is the most common
  - ZSH -->  which is an extension of BASH
  - CSH and TCSH --> These are unix based shells

Starting A Shell
  - Most Linux systems have CTRL-ALT-t to start a terminal
  - This is usually BASH, check with --> echo $0
  
How To Run A Shell Script
  - To run a shell script you will need to know absolute or relative path
  - Absolute path is the full loaction of a file on the system  eg home/user/scripts/script1.sh
  - Relative is only a portion eg from with the user directory would be /scripts/script1.sh
  - To check location on a system use pwd to list working directory
