                    Jenkins, From Zero To Hero: Become a DevOps Jenkins Master


Create A Docker Container For Jenkins
  - Using Docker to spin up the Jenkins service
  - Ensure that the folder you created allows Jenkins to write
    - Jenkins may be listed as user 1000 on a system
    - The id command will show service uid's
    - To change ownership of the folder to Jenkins to ensure write privileges are present
      - sudo chown 1000:1000 jenkins_home -R
        - The -R will apply permissions recursively
  - To bring up the jenkins service using docker compose
    - docker-compose up -d
    - This uses the docker-compose.yml file that has just been created
  - To view the docker logs use the following command
    - docker logs -f 
    - docker logs -f  jenkins (which is for the jenkins service just started)
  - Entering the ip address and port 8080 will show the unlock Jenkins page
    - You will need to enter the initial password
    - It is in 2 locations but can be seen in the logs -f output for the jenkins service
    - It will look like a hashed value
  - Once in Jenkins you should install the suggested plugins
  - You will then need to create a first admin user
