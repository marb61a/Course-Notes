                    Course Notes Part 1 
                    Jenkins, From Zero To Hero: Become a DevOps Jenkins Master


Introduction And Installation
  - https://jenkins.io
  - Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.
  - Jenkins is used a lot in CI/CD
  - Jenkins can be used to automate most things eg Docker, AWS etc
  - These tools will be taught more through the course
Note
  - The course will show how to build a Linux VM on Windows due to simulating a real-world environment
    - There are a whole set of instructions on setting up Virtual Box and bulding a VM
  - This will mean needing to have Virtual Box installed
    - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
  - Linux users can just use their distro
  - The VM created uses the CentOS distro 
    - https://www.centos.org/download/
    - CentOS is not listed in the menu on Virtual Box, use Red Hat
      - There is 2gb need in memory
    - Use the bridged adapter for the network
      - Select the Ethernet adapter as that is the most reliable

Install Docker
  - Each platform will have its own process for installing Docker
  - One example is the course distro which is CentOS which uses YUM package manager
    - EG sudo yum install
  - You can search the Docker page for instructions
  - There is also the option of setting the stable repository
    - Again this is platform specific
  - The installation can take some time
  - To start the service use the following command
    - sudo systemctrl start docker
  - To ensure that Docker starts at system startup time
    - sudo systemctrl enable docker
  - To check the status of the Docker installation
    - docker ps
  - This will cause an error which can be fixed by using
    - sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
    - This tells the system to added jenkins to the docker group

Download the Jenkins Docker Image
  - Downloading a pre-built image which will have all the needed setup taken care of
    - https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/
  - To download use the following command
    - docker pull jenkins/jenkins
  - Docker will save a lot of time in setting up a service
  - To see Docker images use the docker images command
  - To see where docker is saving files use the following command
    - docker info | grep -i root
