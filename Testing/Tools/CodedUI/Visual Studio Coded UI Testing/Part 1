Introduction to Visual Studio for CUIT - Part 1
Visual Studio is the most popular Rapid Application Development tool
  - RAD -- Acronym for Rapid Application Development
  - It does not develop just Windows and Web apps
  - iOS, Android, Office and cloud apps can be also developed
  - It supports multiple different languages eg C#. F#, VB etc
  - There is a whole ecosystem of plugins available
  - The test features are not inclined towards testers but developers
  - Automated tests that drive your application through its user interface are known as CodedUI (cuits) tests
  - CUIT help you verify that your application is working properly
  - These type of tests are especially useful where there is logic in the UI eg validation
  - They are also frequently used to automate manual tests


Introduction to Visual Studio for CUIT - Part 2
  - Ordered testing is used in conjunction with CodedUI
    - These hold different tests to run in differing orders
  - Ordered tests are very useful when running a large amount of similar tests in a specific order
    - This can be done using an ordered list
  - Unit Testing is a type of testing used often by developers
    - This is where tests methods are written to ensure that methods behave as expected
  - Web Performance Testing simulates user interaction with the application
    - This will store HTTP GET and POST requests of the application
    - This can be used with load testing via virtual users as if it were a real user performing actions
  - Load Testing is used to load test an application via virtual users
    - This tests not only the application but the web services as well
    - The results are stored in an SQL Server database to facilitate analysis
