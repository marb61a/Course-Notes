                          Beginner To Guru Part 3
                          Course Notes


Compiling And Packaging With Maven
  - The goal of the lesson is to build a jar using Maven 
  - Creating a pom.xml file
  - This is the primary files for decribing Maven builds
  - It is XML based and brings in an XML namespace
  - XSD is XML Schema Definition
  - Maven co-ordinates are group-id, artifact-id and version
  - UTF-8 is the standard outputEncoding format
  - You must have Maven installed
    - To check use mvn --version
  - The mvn clean command will clean up the environment
  - The mvn package command will attempt to create a package
    - This will create a target directory
    - Inside the directory is jar file with a version number and a maven-archiver file
  - Again you can open the jar file like a zip file
    - There are a few extra files compared to the previous non-maven compliation version
    - There is a pom.xml file and a pom.properties file
    - The MANIFEST file will show comments on who built the file etc, date created
  - Using the mvn clean command at this point will remove the target directory that was created
    - This is because the command will remove build artifacts
  - You will need to create a /src/main/java directory
    - This is where you can put java files to be compiled
    - This will add the class file to the jar file when it is created
  - The command for getting back several directories
    - cd ../../../
  - You can also use multiple commands on the same line
    - mvn clean package
    - This will clean and then try to create a package

Including Dependencies With Maven
  - You will need to let Maven know about dependencies to avoid compilation errors
    - This will be added to the pom.xml in the dependencies tags 
    - These follow <dependencies></dependencies> format
    - Inside the dependencies tags is a set of dependency tags for each dependency
    - Inside the dependency tags is the groupId etc coordinates
  - Each dependency will need a set of Maven coordinates

Creating A New Project With IntelliJ
  - Create a new project and select Maven project
  - This will generate a list of archetypes which are similar to starter projects
  - To accept a plain Maven project just click next
  - This will then ask to enter a set of Maven coordinates
  - GroupId is just a reverse domain name
  - To avoid Maven import issues the IDE will allow user to enable auto imports
  
Assignment
  - Course assignment to Apache String Utils to project
  - This will be done using an IDE rather than the command line
  - The second part of the assignment is to add a Sytem.out.println message to main class using StringUtils
