                          Maven Basics
Maven Coordinates
  - Maven Coordinates are used to identify artifacts
  - Taken together, they identify a ‘location’ in a Maven repository
    - groupId which is typically unique to an organisation and is often just a reverse domain like a java project package
    - artifactId this is typically the project name, it is a descriptor for the artifact
    - version which refers to a specific version of the project
    - groupId and version can be inherited from a parent POM.

Maven Version
  - Understanding Maven versions can be needed for managing projects
    - Example - 3.2.1-987-beta
    - Major Version is indicated by first number - 3
    - Minor Version is indicated by second number - 2
    - Incremental Version (patch) is indicated by third number - 1
    - Build Number which is from CI Build in this case - 987
    - Qualifier which is a String Qualifier - ‘beta’
    - The most common in use is just major.minor.incremental (3.2.1)
