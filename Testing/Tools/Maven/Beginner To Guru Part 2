Compiling Java
  - The Java compile process is as follows
    - Source files eg hello.java -> compiler -> hello.class -> jvm runtime
    - Other language files which run on the jvm also follow this path
    - hello.scala, hello.groovy and hello.kt which is Kotlin
  - There are different ways in which to package a Java application
    - *.jar -- Java ARchive which is a Zip file containing one or more Java class files
    - *.war -- Web Application aRchive is Zip file containing web application and includes one or more jar files, class files and web resources.
    - *.ear -- Enterprise aRchive which is a Zip file containing one more more WAR files.
    - Fat JAR (aka Uber JAR) -- Executable Jar containing all dependencies. (Used by Spring Boot)
    - Docker Container - Docker Image containing runtime environment, JVM, and Java package
  - There are also a few ways to deploy Java applications
    - Simple JAR files are typically collection of class files used to compose applications
      - They are typically not a complete application
    - WAR, EAR files are typically complete applications which are deployed to application servers eg Tomcat
    - Fat / Uber Jars are typically complete applications which contain embedded application servers and can be deployed stand alone
    - Docker Images are complete applications which can be deployed stand alone
    - The trend is towards the last 2 with the growth of microservices rather than monlithic applications
