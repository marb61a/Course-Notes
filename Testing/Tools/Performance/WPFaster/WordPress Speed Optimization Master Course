2 - Compression Primer 
In this context it is the GZip compression of text based assets eg Javascript, HTML, CSS
Zip compresses resources making them smaller which makes the site faster
GZip is not context specific
GZip makes information smaller without changing the meaning

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from source code without affecting the functionality
Characters include whitespace etc
Minification is context specific
Minification is linked with concatenation eg concatenating 5 minified css files into 1

HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
A HTTP request is when a browser requests a file
HTTP is a request and response protocol
Javascript and CSS block site rendering
Fewer JS\CSS HTTP requests will make the site faster
Less images and smaller versions will also make the site faster

Optimising images can yield some of the greatest performance improvements
With image optimisation, information can be removed, eliminated or changed in a way text based information cant be
2 methods of image optimisation
 - Lossy which removes pixels
 - Lossless no pixels removed
Both methods strip out metadata(properties, resolution etc)

JS and CSS block rendering
Above the fold comes from print media mainly newspaper
Anything below the fold can wait

Optimising the Critical Rendering Path means optimising everything needed to render above the fold content


8 - Caching Primer

 - Reduces network traffic
Caching types
 - Page Caching
 - Browser Caching
