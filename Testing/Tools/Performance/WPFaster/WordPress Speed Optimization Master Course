                    WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course  
                    

                    Section 1 - Introduction to the Official WpFASTER WordPress Speed Optimization Master Course
1 - Website Speed: How Much it Matters & Why "Fast Enough" Isn't 
Quick introduction to the instructor
Google gives tools away to help optimization
Preloading(pre-rendering) - The loading of a webpage prior to clicking its listing in anticipation of you doing it
Google - 500 millisecond slowdown = 20% reduction in ad revenue
Bing - 2 seconds of increased load time = 2.5% reduction in queries and clicks
Amazon - 100 miliseconds of slowdown = 1% decrease in revenue
Yahoo - 400 milllisecond improvement = 9% traffic increase
Bottom line slow sites will cost business
Speed is critical to your success

2 - Course Syllabus 
PDF detailing syllabus covered by the course

3 - How to Take the Course
Tips on how best the student should approach the course
 - Doing it and practicing will help you learn more
 - Practice on a test site
 - Use proper computer
 
4 - What the Course Is (& Is Not) 
The course is primarily a course covering
 - WPO - Web Performance Optimization
 - FEO - Front End Optimization course
 - UX - User Experience
SEO optimisation is not covered

5 - Remarks on Optimizing for Mobiles/Tablets (I.e. "High Latency" Devices) 
More people are using mobile devices to surf sites
Latency is one of two primary elements that determines how your site performs on mobil\tablet devices
The second element is bandwidth
Latency refers to several types of delays
Excessive latency causes bottlenecks
WPTouch is recommended as the best mobile plugin to decrease latency for people navigating to your site
There is a pro version of WpTouch available and a manual is available and should be read

6 - Notes, Links, Supplemental Materials & Whatnot Addendum for Section 1 
Text file for additional material
Google is “obsessed" with speed.
Optimization is a PROCESS not an EVENT 
  - When it comes to website speed there is no such thing as "Fast Enough".



                    Section 2 – The WpFASTER WordPress Speed/Performance Optimization Foundation
1 - Hosting Primer 
Host is where your site lives
Not recommended - specialty, managed WP hosting for 3 reasons
 - Configuration Limitation
 - Access Limitation
 - Support Limitation
Principles of good hosting
 - Can have access and do whatever you want
Shared hosts not recommended either
VPS is the recommended as the best option for hosting

2 - Compression Primer 
In this context it is the GZip compression of text based assets eg Javascript, HTML, CSS
Zip compresses resources making them smaller which makes the site faster
GZip is not context specific
GZip makes information smaller without changing the meaning


3 - Minification (& Concatenation) Primer 
Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from source code without affecting the functionality
Characters include whitespace etc
Minification is context specific
Minification is linked with concatenation eg concatenating 5 minified css files into 1


4 - Reducing HTTP Requests Primer 
HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
A HTTP request is when a browser requests a file
HTTP is a request and response protocol
Javascript and CSS block site rendering
Fewer JS\CSS HTTP requests will make the site faster
Less images and smaller versions will also make the site faster


5 - Image Optimization Primer 
Every image constitutes a HTTP request
Optimising images can yield some of the greatest performance improvements
With image optimisation, information can be removed, eliminated or changed in a way text based information cant be
2 methods of image optimisation
 - Lossy which removes pixels
 - Lossless no pixels removed
Both methods strip out metadata(properties, resolution etc)


6 - Eliminating Render-Blocking JavaScript & CSS in 'Above-the-Fold' Content Primer 
JS and CSS block rendering
Above the fold comes from print media mainly newspaper
Anything below the fold can wait


7 - Asynchronous Resources Primer 
An aysynchronous resource is one that loads such that it doesnt block page rendering
Optimising the Critical Rendering Path means optimising everything needed to render above the fold content


8 - Caching Primer 
Caching is recommended as the number 1 optimising tip
Caching is used
 - Reduces latency by using the cache instead of making full request
 - Reduces network traffic
Caching types
 - Page Caching
 - Browser Caching
 - Database & Object Caching

 Section 3 – Testing the Efficacy of Your Optimizations
1 - Prefatory Remarks on Website Speed Testing Tools & Metrics (Performance Data) 
What we need to know now
 - Are the optimizations working as we thought that they would
 - How do we know whether they are or are not
** Without accurate metrics its all guesswork
An inaccurate tool can in some circumstances still be accurate
Synthetic Tool
 - Cannot give the most accurate metrics but is still helpful when it is and for the reasons it is
Organic Tools
 - Can give us the most accurate metics but may not help in the same way a synthetic tool can
 

2 - Pingdom: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://tools.pingdom.com
FPT - Full Page Test
A combination of synthetic and organic tool
Easy to use you just have to enter a url
Load time is innaccurate due to it indicating total page and assets load time
Millions of users so comparisons are done with a large set of sites


3 - GTmetrix: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://gtmetrix.com
Pro Version available with options available on test server location
Similar to Pingdom 
Recommendations for improvements are are part of results
Average grade for sites is 80%
Total page size is synthetic and inaccurate
Videos tend not to be counted in metrics
Critical render path again is not evident
YSlow - Yahoo Speed test -- http://yslow.org


4 - Google's PageSpeed Insights: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/
Mobile Friendly test also available
Recommendations for improvements are are part of results
User experience grade is part of test
Instructions on how to fix errors are available
Google places great emphasis on speed


5 - WebPageTest: What it's Good For & When to Use It 
Available at - https://www.webpagetest.org
Gives actual and actionable metrics
You can choose from multiple locations and also multiple browsers
You are able to introduce real world scenarios eg DSL, Wireless etc
9 tests are the minimum number that should be run
Video can be captured by a test
Tests can be kept private
In the documentation is an instruction on how to interperet results
Multiple metrics available eg First Byte to help understand critical render path
Results shown are median
Speed index test is testing relative to other sites
You should aim to be in the top 20% which is elite level
DOM content & Start Render should be as quick as possible

                    Section 4 Recap & Remarks On Optimizing Your WordPress Site's 'Core'
1 - Sections 1 - 3 Recap & Prefatory Remarks on 'Core' Optimization 


Section 5  - Caching
1 - Caching: Prefatory Remarks 
Wordpress has multiple ways to cache sites
W3TotalCache Plugin is recommended - https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/
If issues are experienced upon installation it can be an indicator of needing a new host
Always have a backup of the site


2 - Page Caching How-To + Troubleshooting 
Read the installation instruction!!!
Plugin install via the usual plugin install method
Performance -> Settings will bring up screen
You may want to enable preview mode
Enable Page cache, disk enhanced if possible as the method
If after enabling your site is slower use disk basic method
Virtual Server settings not the best option for caching pages
Performance -> Page Cache
General Section
 - Check cache posts page
 - Cache front page
 - Cache feeds etc
 - Cache ssl
 - Cachng 404 pages will depend on the size of site
 - Dont cache for logged in users
 - Dont cache pages for certain user roles
Cache Preload Section
 - Leave the section blank
Cache Page Purge Policy
 - Leave defaults in place until site is running and then fine tune
Sitemaps
 - Leave defaults in place
Advanced
 - Fragment caching is paid for(not that big a performance boost)
 - Enable compatibility mode (may cause performance decrease)
 - Don't mess with UTF encoding
 - Garbage collection interval will depend on the site
 - Comment cookie lifetime as low as possible
 - Don't cache checkout pages
 

3 - Browser Caching (+ Headers Optimization) How-To + Troubleshooting 
Performance -> General Settings -> Browser Cache
Again enable Preview Mode
Performance -> Browser Cache
General 
 - E-Tag is checked
 - Set Expires Header is checked
 - Total Cache header is security risk
 - Enable HTTP (GZip) compression
CSS & JS
 - Set Expires Header is checked (make a very long time eg 1 year in seconds)
 - Cache control policy is not checked but if checked has a list of options
 - Enable HTTP(GZip) compression (Can be disabled during troubleshooting)
 - Disable cookies for static files
HTML & XML
 - Set Expires Header is checked (number matches page cache garbage collection removal) (also different from previous option)
 - Entity(E)-Tag is checked
Media & Other Files
 - Set Expires Header is checked (make a very long time eg 1 year in seconds)
 - Entity(E)-Tag is checked
 - Enable HTTP (GZip) compression
 - Disable cookies for static files
 
Gzip - Not that efficient for image compression


4 - Database & Object Caching How-To + Troubleshooting 
Particularly helpful for dynamic sites
Performance -> General Settings -> Database Cache
Enable Database cache
Different methods of DB caching available
  -> If available Opcode APC -- Alternative PHP Cache should be used (May need to be installed on the server)
  *** - May not be available on shared hosting
Enable Object Cache
 -> If available Opcode APC -- Alternative PHP Cache should be used (May need to be installed on the server)
  *** - May not be available on shared hosting
Try these one at a time and then both to test performance levels

Go then to the side menu -> Database Cache
 - Dont cache queries for logged in users
 - Garbage collection interval set to 2 hours (7200)
 - Match it with maximum lifetime of objects
 - You can never cache particular pages
 - You can ignore query stems and particular query words
 
Go then to the side menu -> Object Cache
 - Garbage collection interval set to 2 hours (7200)
 - Match it with maximum lifetime of objects
 - If using WP is network mode you can set groups 

Object cache can cause issues and is only really helpful for very dynamic sites
