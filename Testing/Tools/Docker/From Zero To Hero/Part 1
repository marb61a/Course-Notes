Introduction
What is Docker
  - It is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run apps by using containers
  - These containers allow a developer to package up an app with all the parts it needs and ship as one package

What is a Container
  - Most containers are running in Linux
  - A container is an isolated process in a namespace
  - This process isolation is called sandboxing
  - You can limit CPU, Hard Drive etc in a container so it will do only what you want
  - A container is merely a process in a sandbox
  - In Docker it is usally 1 process per container

What is an Image
  - A Docker image is a file, comprised of multiple layers, used to execute code in a Docker container
  - An image is essentially built from the instructions for a complete and executable version of an application
  - Most Docker images start with a base image, although a user can build one entirely from scratch, if desired
