TestCafe
    - https://www.devexpress.com/products/testcafestudio/ (not open source)
    - TestCafe is a free and opensource NodeJS tool to automate e2e testing
        - It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux
    - It supports desktop, mobile, remote and cloud browsers
        - These can also be headless
        - Tests can also be ran in Javascript or Typescript
    - It is an alternative to other testing and automation solutions
    - It is easy to install with one command
    - It is a unique technology
        - It does not control the browser like Puppeteer/Webdriver
        - It is not a browser itself unlike cypress
    - The core is a proxy server which tansforms JS/HTML code to include automation code
    - There are several reasons to use TestCafe
        - Not having to worry about waiting for an element to load
        - Parallel testing in multiple browsers is simple
        - Supports BDD, data driven testing and Page Object Model
        - It is compatible with CI tools

End to End testing
    - This is also known as E2E testing
    - This is a technique to test whether an application flows from start to finish behaves as expected
    - These tests simulate real world user scenarios essentially testing an app how a real user would use the application
    - The purpose of performing E2E tests is to identify dependencies and to ensure data integrity is maintained between systems
    - The benefits of E2E testing are
        - Verification that the entire system is working properly
        - Prevention of bugs or regression issues
    - There are a few different components of TestCafe
        - Client-server
            - There is no external driver needed in TestCafe
            - This allows for cross browser and multi-platform testing
            - TestCafe uses a url rewriting proxy instead of WebDriver
            - This injects the driver script that emulates user actions into a test page
            - TestCafe uses 10.0.75.1 when testing
            - There are reasons for using a server in TestCafe
                - A database or web service can be launched from the tests
                - Access can be gotten to the server file system to read data samples or check uploads
                - Tests can make use of all Node.js features and external modules
                - Tests became faster and more stable as test logic is now separated from the automation scripts
                - Test code can't interrupt the page execution, because TestCafe doesn't inject user-written code
                - The latest syntax features like async/await are supported also with TestCafe
        - TestCafe API
            - Test code uses TestCafe API methods to interact with the tested page
            - There are 3 main types of interaction
                - Select Elements
                - Perform actions
                - Execute assertions
        - Page Proxying
        - Isolated Tests
            - TestCafe isolates each test run from subsequent tests and tests that run in parallel.
            - After a test is completed, TestCafe resets the browser state by
                - Deleting cookies
                - Clearing both local and session storage
                - Reloading the test page
    - TestCafe Studio vs Open-source TestCafe
        - TestCafe Studio is a cross-platform IDE for end-to-end testing or end-to-end web testing
        - It is also multi platform and works in every browser including mobile
        - It has a lot of features such as
            - Visual test recorder, Cross-browser testing and Comprehensive reports with powerful code editor

Install TestCafe
    - Needs to have NodeJS installed
    - VS is used but can be any text editor
    - To check npm version for installing packages
        - Enter the following command npm -v
    - Install the testcafe extensions available on the VSCode marketplace
    - Install the testcafe npm packages

TestCafe Example
    - Initial test examples will use the TestCafe demo site
    - This will be replaced by a more real world example later
    - It is important for testers to understand async\await in Javascript
        - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/async-await-javascript-tutorial/
    - Async\Await is used by TestCafe in all cases
    - TestCafe tests must be organised into categories that are called fixtures
        - A JS/TS file with TestCafe tests can contain 1 or more fixtures
        - To declare a fixture simply use the fixture function
            - fixture 'Authentication Tests' .page 'url'
        - To create a test call the test function a pass a function which contains the test code
            - The test code function accepts the test controller objectas a parameter
                  fixture 'MyFixture';
                  test('Test1', async t => {
                    // Test 1 Code
                })
                  test('Test2', async t => {
                    // Test 2 Code
                })
            - 
    - Test controller 
        - A  test controller exposes the test API's methods and passing to each function that can run server-side test code.
        - Some examples of functions are  test, beforeEach or afterEach.
        - A test controller can be used to 
            - Call test actions
            - Handle browser dialogs
            - Use the wait functions
            - Execute assertions
        - The test runner also uses a test controller to access the internal context required for the test API to operate.

First Test
    - Added tests folder and firstTest.js
    - Need to prefix testcafe command with npx to run on Windows
    - This maybe because local installs are not added to the path

Using Selectors with Elements
    - The Selector API provides methods and properties to select elements on the page and get their state
    - TestCafe uses standard CSS selectors to locate elements
    - This is similar to using document.querySelector in JavaScript or FindElementBy.CSSSelector in Selenium Webdriver
    - In a test  before the fixture there is a need to import the selector from TestCafe
        - This is done using the import keyword
        - This will remove hardcoded selectors in the test script
        - An array can be used if there is a need to import different names.
    - Before the selector and after the import there can be constants added for the various selecor elements needed
        - These will replace the presently hardcoded values

Specify the Start Webpage
    - The URL is being passed with the fixture but can also be added with the test
        - The test url can differ from the fixture url
        - The fixture url can be set to something like a base page or base url 
        - This is similar to multiple other frameworks
    - The test url will be ran when specified ahead of the fixture url
        - This overrides the fixture specified url

Fixture and Test Metadata
    - TestCafe allows you to specify additional information for tests in the form of key-value metadata
    - You can display this information in the reports and use them to filter tests
        - One example is a command which runs tests whose metadata's device property is set to mobile, and env property is set to production
            - npx testcafe chrome my-tests --test-meta device=mobile,env=production
        - Again the npx is needed to run the tests on some Windows machines
    - Metadata can also  be defined for tests and fixtures
        - This uses fixture.meta and test.meta
    - To run a test file with specific environment such as production
        -  npx testcafe chrome .\tests\testMetaScript.js --test-meta env=production
        - Running the tests with the additional options will run both tests in the file rather than 1 which matches metadata

Interact with Page Elements
    - Navigate
        - TestCafe provides a set of actions that you can use to interact with the page including
            - Click, Navigate, Hover, Drag, Type text and more
        - This will navigate to the URL specified in the test fixture and then to the navigateTo URL
    - IFrame
        - This uses the IFrame test example found at -> http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/iframe
        - switchToIframe() switches the test's browsing context to the specified iFrame
        - switchToMainWindow() switches back to the main window from the IFrame
    - Dropdownlist & Upload file
        - How to select an option inside the drop-down list
        - There are usually 2 things to do in TestCafe with dropdown lists
            - Get the dropdown list to drop and then select an option
        - Again using the internet.herokuapp.com site for uploading an image
            - https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload
        - Uploading a file in TestCafe is done using setFilesToUpload() function
            - This needs to have a path to the file(s) to be uploaded
            - setFilesToUpload() with TestCafe automatically waits until the file is uploaded to the server
            - This means that there are no additional commands or libraries needed
            - Uploads can also be cleared with one function -> clearUpload()
                - This removes all the file paths from the specific file upload input
    - Set Test Speed
        - Tests can be ran very quickly which may not give time to see what is occurring
        - This is why there is a need to be able to reduce test speed
        - This makes use of the setTestSpeed method
    - Set Page Timeout
        - setPageLoadTimeout() specifies the amount of time within which TestCafe waits for the window.load event to fire before starting the test
    - Drag & Hover
        - drag an element to a specific offset using TestCafe
        - Example is a slider and it will be able to be dragged to a specific offset
        - This makes use of the drag() command from TestCafe
        - drag uses different offsets of X and Y of the mouse pointer
        - Hover -> hovers a mouse pointer over a webpage element

 Hooks 
    -  What are TestCafe Hooks
        - TestCafe allows you to specify functions that are executed before a fixture or a test is started or after it's finished. 
        - Test hooks override fixture hooks
        - If a test runs in several browsers then the test hooks are executed in each browser
        - A hook can be specified for each test in a fixture with the fixture.beforeEach or fixture.afterEach methods

Assertions
    - TestCafe provides a comprehensive set of assertions
    - These are based on a behavior-driven development style or BDD style
    - In order to construct assertions the expected method of the test controller is used
    - In assertions the check is that the actual results are equal to the expected one
    - The equal() function is used
        - This takes the parameters expected, message, and options if we wanted to add anything else
        - The assertion query timeout can be specified in test code, with the options.timeout option
        - The assertion can only be tried or a timeout can be with the assertions, with options to timeout
    - There are different and a huge number of assertions methods with TestCafe including
        - ok, not ok
        - match, not match
        - within, not within
        - type of, not type of
        - contains, not contains

Skip Test
    - An additional feature with TestCafe is the ability to skip tests with one single configuration
    - Use the fixture.skip and test.skip methods for this
    - Also use fixture.only and test.only methods to specify that only a particular test or fixture should run while all the others should be skipped
    
Working with client-side information
    - TestCafe allows for creating client functions that can return any serializable value from the client-side
        - This can be a current URL or custom data calculated by a client script
    - TestCafe has ClientFunction which needs to be imported like Selector
    - Using ClientFunction it is necessary to get window.location.href
        - This will always contains the current URL from the browser

Test execution
    - TestCafe is designed to support most modern browsers
    - TestCafe automatically detects the popular browsers installed on a local computer
        - It is actively tested with 
            - Chrome with different versions, IE 11 +, Edge (legacy\chromium based), Safari, Firefox, Mobile (Saferi\Chrome)
    - To see which browsers are supported
        - testcafe --list-browsers
    - To run tests on all the local browsers using the following command
        - testcafe all tests
    - To run test on multiple browsers together
        - testcafe firefox,chrome,safari tests/firstTest.js

Run Tests in Parallel
    - TestCafe allows for executing tests concurrently
    - In concurrent mode, TestCafe invokes multiple instances of each browser
        - These instances constitute the pool of browsers against which tests run concurrently
        - For example, each test runs in the first available instance
    - To enable using concurrency use -c or --concurrency at the command line
        - npx testcafe -c 5 chrome .\tests\testOnlyTest.js
        - This invokes 5 instances of Chrome and runs the tests concurrently
    - TestCafe concurrenncy means running or splitting the test with different concurrency
        - This is not repeating the test with the same or with each instance
    - Concurrency can also be used with testing against multiple browsers
        - npx testcafe -c 5 chrome,firefox .\tests\testOnlyTest.js
    - Live Mode
        - Live mode ensures TestCafe and the browsers remain active while working on tests
    - Use -L or --live flag to enable live mode from the command line interface
        - npx testcafe chrome .\tests\testOnlyTest.js -L
    - After entering the test to be ran in live mode there are some commands available
        - Ctrl+S to stop the test run
        - Ctrl+R to restart the test run
        - Ctrl+W to enable or disable watching files
        - Ctrl+C to quit the live mode and close the browsers
    - With live mode, changes can be made to anything in the script, and after that, the test will run again automatically and take the change
    - Concurrent test execution is not supported in Microsoft Edge

Filter Tests By Metadata & Name
    - Tests and fixtures can be filtered by metadata
        - testcafe chrome ./tests/ --fixture-meta device=mobile,env=production
            - To filter fixtures with specific data, use the --fixture-meta argument
        - testcafe chrome tests/testMetaScript.js --test-meta env=production
            - runs the specified test 
    - Tests and fixtures can also be ran by name
        - testcafe safari ./tests/HooksTest.js -t "First Test"
        - The t option is added to add a test by name which is specified in a string at the end of the command
        - This can also be done in the runner.filter method

Headless Mode
    - Headless mode can be very useful when running CI servers
    - This consumes less resources as there is no GUI
    - Use the :headless parameter to launch a browser in headless mode.
    - This can be ran with either firefox or chrome
        - testcafe chrome:headless tests/firstTest.js
        - testcafe firefox:headless tests/firstTest.js
    - Headless is not available with Safari

Deep Dive With TestCafe
Wait Mechanisms
    - There are different mechanisms with TestCafe for the wait, for actions, or with selectors or assertions
    - TestCafe has a built-in automatic waiting mechanism
        - There is no  requirement for a dedicated API to wait for redirects or page elements to appear
        - These mechanisms work when TestCafe performs test actions, evaluates assertions and selectors, sends requests, and navigates the browser
    - Wait Mechanisms for actions
        - TestCafe automatically waits for the target element to become visible when an action is executed
        - TestCafe tries to evaluate the specific selector multiple times within the timeout
        - If the element does not appear the test will fail
        - The timeout option to specify the selector timeout in the test code
            - This can be done 2 ways
                - Pass the timeout to the runner.run API method or add it on the cli
    - Wait Mechanism for Selectors
        - Using a Selector TestCafe will automatically wait for an element to appear in the DOM
        - There is also a way to  require that TestCafe should wait for an element to become visible
            - This uses the the visibilityCheck selector option 
    - Wait Mechanism for Assertions
        - TestCafe assertions use a Smart Assertion Query mechanism
        - This is activated when a selector property or a client function as an actual value is passed
        - When an action triggers a redirect, TestCafe automatically waits for the server to respond
        - The test continues if the server doesn't respond within 15 seconds

Debugging
    - There are different ways to debug our test cases with TestCafe
    - The first method is to use Debug Mode
        - Add --debug on the command line
            - A debug can also be added in a test using debug()
        - After this is added the test being ran is started in debug mode
        - This allows for checking step by step on what occurred during the test
        - In this mode, test execution is paused before the first action or assertion
            - This is to allow invoking the developer tools and the debug
        - When the test execution reaches t.debug that was already added in a test
            - The test pauses to allow opening browser developer tools
            - This will allow for checking page state, DOM elements, location, their CSS, and more
            - In the broswer window the footer displays a status report in which test execution can be resumed or skipped to the next action
        - Debug Mode on Fail
            - This is where a test is setup to automatically enter debug mode on failure
            - It is done using the command line parameter --debug-on-fail
            - npx testcafe chrome .\tests\testOnlyTest.js --debug-on-fail
        - Use the Unlock page switch in the footer to unlock the tested page and interact with its elements
    - Taking Screenshots
        - This can be done on failure or during tests
        - A screenshot can be either the entire page or with an element
    - An additional feature is the ability to record videos
        - Again this is done in TestCafe natively without a need to use an external API

Take Screenshots
    - There are some prerequisites for Screenshots
        - TestCafe allows for taking screenshots on the tested webpage at any moment during a test run or automatically whenever a test fails
        - Screenshots required .NET 4.0 or newer install on Windows machines
        - Use t.takeScreenshot to take a screenshot of the entire page, or t.takeElementScreenshot action to capture a particular element.
        - Screenshots are not supported when you run tests in remote browsers
        - Using -s can be a shortcut for screenshot

Video Recording with TestCafe
    - TestCafe allows you to record the videos of test runs, but we should install the FFmpeg library to record the videos
    - If FFmpeg is not installed it can be using npm 
        - npm install --save @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg
    - The videos that are generated are then saved in MP4 format
    - To enable the video recording add --video to the cli command of the test run
        - To keep videos together setup a videos folder and an artifacts folder to hold all test related artifacts
    - Video will not run in VS code but folder can be opened and video should run
    - To run only when tests are failing use the following options 
        - npx testcafe chrome .\tests\elementScreenshotDemo.js --video artifacts/videos --video-options failedOnly=true
    - There are a few options that TestCafe supports for videos
        - failedOnly -- When true records failed tests only
        - singleFile -- When set to true saves recordings as a single file

Visual Studio Code Extensions
    - Testlatte is already installed
    - There are code snippets available having installed the extensions
    - There are multiple different options available for the different code blocks
    - Tests folder will need to be renamed to test to use the test runner

Pages
Page Model
    - Page Model is a test automation pattern that allows you to create an abstraction of the test pages
        - This allows is to be used in the test code to refer to the page element
    - Why use the Page Object Model or Page Model
        - There are several problems which using the Page Object Model solves
            - Changes in locator names will need to be adjusted in multiple file as there is no shared file
            - Code duplication coming from repetition
            - Difficulty in maintaining due to large amounts of unnecessary files 
    - In this model classes are created for each page in the application
        - The class then has web page elements, also add the methods which perform actions or operations on those elements

!!!!!
    - Chrome may fail tests due to screen not being maximised
    - Firefox still has the same elements available in a reduced size window
    - Use the maximizeWindow() command
    - May need to use this inside await functions on occasion if some elements are not being seen

TestCafe uses the .testcaferc.json configuration file to store its settings
    - Settings specified when running TestCafe from the command line and the programming interfaces override settings from .testcaferc.json
    - Keep .testcaferc.json in the directory from which test cases are ran

Data-Driven Tests with TestCafe
    - Data-Driven Tests is a procedure when you repeat the same scenario with different input parameters
        - The results are then verified with the output values
    - Test data is always an important part of automated tests
        - Test data is not just the value or the text in the application, but it's about the whole environment being tested
        - Usually hardcoded data such as a URL is used 
        - Hardcoded data though is not configurable
    - Test data allows for different scenarios to be tested
        - For example a form allowing positive and negative reviews
        - Data can be in different formats -> JSON, XLS, CSV to name a few

Behaviour Driven development
Introduction to BDD and Cucumber JS/HTML
    - Behavior-Driven Development is a technique for building software in which the product owner, developers, and the testers collaborate together 
        - This is so that they can agree about the acceptance criteria
    - The Behavior-Driven pattern is improving communication and collaboration between teams
    - Similar to TDD or Test-Driven Development, which starts development by writing test cases
        - BDD is similar but start by writing the business features file prior to writing the automated test cases
    - When writing features use plain English sentences and the Gherkin language
    - Step Definition file
        - To start implementing the steps from the feature file in real code
    - To run tests using the Cucumber file
        - ./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js
    - In order to run multiple sets of data scenario will have to be changed
        - This will change to Scenario Outline 
    - The final item that can be added are Tags
        - Add a tag to the scenario eg e2e and then run from the cli
        - ./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --tags "@e2e"
    - Cucumber HTML report
        - npm i cucumber-html-reporter
        - This will integrate html reports on testing
    - Adding entry to package.json to run testcafe cucumber is not working so full command is needed
        - ./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --tags '@e2e' --format json:reports/report.json
    - To see generated report 
        - node <file_name> 
        - In order to see the html version there will need to be a cucumber_report.json file presently
        - These can be created blank and the cli can be change to point to the correct file like such
            - ./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js --tags '@e2e' --format json:test/report/cucumber_report.json

Reports
TestCafe Reports
    - Reporters are plugins used to output test run reports in a certain format
    - Reporter plugins are npm packages
    - TestCafe ships with multiple Reporters
        - spec (default), xUnit, JSON, List, HTML, Allure Report
    - To install the TestCafe HTML reporter
        - npm install testcafe-reporter-html 
    - After installation the reporter can be ran from the cli
        - npx testcafe firefox .\tests\RegistrationSteps.js --reporter html
        - This will send HTML to the console by default
    - In order to generate a HTML file there is an additional command needed
        - npx testcafe firefox .\tests\RegistrationSteps.js --reporter html:report.html
    - Open command does not exist on Windows platform
        - start can be used instead
        - To start the report file use start report.html
        - This will open the file in the default browser

Allure Reports
    - To install the Allure reports package
        - npm install testcafe-reporter-allure
    - To run the Allure reporter
        - npx testcafe firefox .\tests\RegistrationSteps.js --reporter allure
    - After running there will be an Allure folder generated holding the results
        - The results files will be in XML
    - After this then the Allure command line module will need to be installed
        - npm install -g allure-commandline
    - To then view the allure reports
        - allure generate allure/allure-results --clean -o allure/allure-report && allure open allure/allure-report
    - There will be an issue using the concatenated command to generate the report and open
        - As above the open command cannot be used so start will be needed
        - Also instead of double ampersnad separators && instead use a semi-colon

Visual Testing
Visual Testing With Applitools and TestCafe
    - Applitools provides a software testing platform, powered by Visual AI, or artificial intelligence
        - It can be used by test automation, manual QA, and DevOps teams
    - Applitools SDKs work with existing test frameworks to take screenshots of pages, elements, regions, or iframes, and upload them along with DOM snapshots
    - Applitools AI then compares them with the previous test executions' screenshots, like Baselines, and reports if there is a bug or not
    - There is a need for a free account with Applitools
        - Using Github to signup is allowed
    - There is a need to get an API key to use in projects

Adding Eyes-TestCafe to Existing Tests
    - The Eyes-TestCafe package will need to be installed
        - npm i -D @applitools/eyes-testcafe

Github Actions
    -  GitHub Actions make it easy to automate all your software workflow
        - This now has world-class CI/CD, or continuous integration and continuous delivery
    - You can build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub
        - As well as the ability to make code reviews, branch management, and the issues management work the way that you want
    - Run a workflow on any GitHub action, like kick-off workflows with GitHub Actions events like push, issue creation, or a new release
    - Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built, and maintained by the community

What is the GitHub Actions workflow?
    - Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub
    - Workflows run in Linux, macOS, and Windows, and containers on GitHub-hosted machines
    - You can create a workflow file configured to run a specific event - like every pull request, scheduled, or manually

Create a Github Account
    - https://github.com/
    - A free github acccount will be needed to be able to use Github actions
    - There are complete set of notes on github functionality available at the following address
        - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Testing/Tools/Git/Step%20By%20Step

YAML Files for GitHub Actions
    - https://yaml.org/
    - YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages
    - To start to setup actions select the actions tab inside the GitHub repo 
    - Most of the time GitHub will auto-detect the file type and will suggest workflows for them
    - There are some of the steps that can be skipped
    - Comment lines are part of the Yaml file but again are not needed
    - The Github marketplace is a place to get plugins to extend Github
        - https://github.com/marketplace
    - There is a plugin needed to run TestCafe tests
        - There are a couple available actions available 
        - Install TestCafe and Run Tests are the actions needed
    - The checkout action fetches the repository
    - The uses action in the yaml file installs the needed package
    - After proposing a new to start a commit a PR or pull request can be made

Run with multiple OS and NodeJS versions
    - This will again make use of the above processes
    - The example will also use something called the strategy and matrix
    - A matrix is a set of keys and values that allows you to spawn several jobs starting from a single job definition
    - This is done inside the strategy sections 
    - Depending on the project needs it may be necessary to make a branch for the yaml file
    - In the build definition the strategy section can be add like below
    - strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
        node: [8, 10, 12]
    - This will use both multiple versions of Node and multiple OS versions

TestCafe Docker image
    - Docker is a tool that allows developers or system admins to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox
        - https://www.docker.com/
        - These are called containers and will run on a host operating system
    - Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development
        - Unlike virtual machines, containers don't have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources
    - What are containers?
        - Previously virtual machines wered used to run applications
        - VMs run applications inside the guest operating systems, which run on virtual hard powered by server host OS
            - VMs are great at providing full process isolation for applications
        - There are very few ways a problem in the host operating system can affect a software running as a guest operating system
            - This is true vice versa but VM isolation can be expensive resource wise
        - Containers take a different approach by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system
            - Containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power
        - Why use containers
            - Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they run
            - This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently regardless of the target environment
            - This gives the developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the application and they can be run anywhere
    - Installing Docker
        - There will be different ways of installing Docker on each platform
        - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
        - To check if installation is successful use the following command
            - docker info
            - This should show all the details about the Docker desktop version - the containers, images, and all the info that's related to Docker
    - Download TestCafe Docker Image
        - To download the TestCafe Image with Docker use the following command
            - docker pull testcafe/testcafe
            - This will download the latest version from TestCafe Docker Image 
        - The latest Docker image contains all the dependencies you need to run TestCafe
            - The image includes the Test Cafe executable for running tests and this also includes recent versions of Firefox and chromium-browser to run your tests
            - Tests can be ran in headless mode or normal mode since the image is set up with the XVFB display server
            - This display server allows you to use functionality like taking a screenshot during your test runs
        - When you run the test using Docker image, you want to see the browser open up and run your test, even in Normal mode
        - Running a graphical interface using Docker on your desktop such as a web browser, requires additional configuration to allow Docker to use your desktop display server
            - This may be a complicated solution and varies by system
    - Running your tests inside TestCafe's Docker Container
        - To run the test to inside the Docker container use the following command
            - docker run -v ${TEST_FOLDER}:/tests -it testcafe/testcafe ${TESTCAFE_ARGS}
            - ${TEST_FOLDER} is the local folder for our tests
            - /tests is the folder that we need to copy our tests inside the Docker container
            - Then there is a need to name the version of the container with TestCafe
            - After that the TestCafe arguments can be passed such as the browser name, the test file etc
        - Just mention that we can run on Chromium or Firefox because the Docker container just includes these two browsers 
            - It does not include the Chrome browser

Run Tests on a remote device
    -  Run Tests on a Mobile Device (Remote)
        - To run tests on a remote mobile device, the device must have network access to the TestCafe server
        - The first thing needed is to create a remote browser connection
        - After that, TestCafe generates a URL to open in the browser that needs to be tested
        - This URL is exposed through the API or displayed in the console
        - To access this URL from the desired browser, it then connects to the TestCafe server and starts the test
        - When running tests in the browser desired the is no screenshot taking or resizing the browser window
        - The steps for running tests on a mobile device are
            - Open the console and type a command to run the tests with remote as a browser alias
            - Add --qr-code flag to generate a QR code for the mobile device
        - An example command is as follows
            - testcafe remote tests/test.js --qr-code
            - testcafe remote means that it will run on the remote device
            - The test needed to be ran is passed and the QR is then output to the console
        - Scan the QR code with a mobile device that has network access to the TestCafe machine or TestCafe server, and open the link
            - TestCafe will then start tests in the mobile browser
        - Then like the example above run the code on the remote browser
        - After clicking enter the QR code will need to be minimised so that it can be scanned with mobile
        - San the code and there shoul be an option open the website
        - Once opened we'll be connected with TestCafe, because we are on the same network
        - After the webpage is opened and the test has passed the results are sent to the TestCafe cli
        - At this point the mobile is then disconnected
 
 Reporter Portal
    - What is ReportPortal?
        - ReportPortal is a service that provides increased capabilities to speed up result analysis and reporting through the use of built-in analytics features
        - It can be a great addition to continuous integration and to the continuous testing process
        - Some of the main features of ReportPortal are
            - Platform integration, ReportPortal integraes very quickly and easily with Jenkins, Jira, BDD process, majority of functional and unit testing frameworks
                - Real-time integration provides businesses the ability to manage and to track execution statuses directly from the ReportPortal
                - Test case execution results are stored following the same structure used in reporting suites and test plans 
                - Logs, screenshots, binary data, the execution pipeline of certain test cases are also available
            - Collaborative analysis as ReportPortal allows for analysing test automation results
                - Particular test cases can be associated with a product, a bug, an automation issue, a system issue, or can be submitted as an issue
            - Historical data of test execution
                - ReportPortal provides enhanced capabilities along with auto result analysis by historical data of test execution and automatic analysis with each execution
                - It automatically figures out the root cause of a fail
                - Test results can be flagged and an engineer can be alerted about an issue to see if further actions are required
    - What technologies are used with ReportPortal?
        - As the is a need for high performance and a high load rate can be expected cutting edge technologies are used
        - These include PostgreSQL, REST Web services, and mobile responsive UI
    -  Installation steps with Docker
        - To be able to run ReportPortal locally, there is a need to use Docker Engine or Docker Compose
        - The first step is to make sure that these are installed
        - The following command can be used
            - curl [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reportportal/reportportal/master/docker]
                (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reportportal/reportportal/master/docker) -compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
        - To then start the application use the following command
            - docker-compose -p reportportal up -d --force-recreate
            - -d is the detach mode
            - --force-recreated is for when ReportPortal has been installed previously, it needed to be recreated from the beginning
        - After this the open the web browser the IP address of the deployed environment is needed as well as port 8080
            - If local then it is localhos:8080
