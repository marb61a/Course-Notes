                    Setting a Foundation for Successful Test Automation
                    Course Notes Part 1


Chapter 1 - Designing a Test Automation Strategy
  - What is the goal for starting a test initiative
    - Different teams will have different reasons for adding test automation
    - Be very clear about the goal and have it at the very front of everything
    - Lack of clarity will probably lead to failure
  - The first item involved in setting a goal is to understand the people nvolved
    - There will be somebody needed to write scripts, monitor results, update tests
    - Theses tasks can be done by 1 person or shared among the team
    - Developers may not be suitable as they may be writing new features
    - It may be difficult to pull developers or testers from existing work
    - Automation Testing can be considered as a software development project in and of itself
    - If you treat the test automation initiative as a side-project then it will fail
    - Some company temporarily reassign staff to put in place test automation
    - Most cases will need a permanent person as either developers or testers will need to learn additional new skill
    - The best choice is likely to hire a trained person in automated testing
      - This person should be treated as a full part of the team
  - How do you plan to execute the tests
    - Automating all tests is not necessarily the right approach
      - This is because there is a cost to this testing
