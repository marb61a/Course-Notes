<h1><p align=center>Section 13 - Software Testing Interview Questions (Manual)</br>

Why do you want to pursue your career in the field of Software Testing?
  -
  - You can begin by mentioning good observation and investigation skills
    - These skills will be of huge beneift when searching for issues in applications 
  - Being interested in puzzle solving can help as this is a skill which helps when finding defects
  - Loving challenges is another good quality to have as testing can be very challenging

Why should we perform Software Testing?
  -
  - Software testing is necesary for a few different reasons
  - Firstly is to check whether or not functionality matches client requirements
  - Another reason is to identify defects which may be present
    - Everybody makes mistakes and they will not be able to find them by themselves 
  - The quality of software applications is improved by rigourous testing
  - Ensuring that applications are ready for users to use is another reason why testing is performed

What is Software Testing?
  -
  - There are a multitude of definitions of what software testing is
  - One is the process of checking whether an application meets client requirements
  - Another is checking whether an application works and meets user needs and expectations
