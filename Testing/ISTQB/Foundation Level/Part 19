Functional and Non-Functional Software Testing
  - Testing happens at all phases of the product development life cycle
  - At every stage of development, testing reveals defects that need to be fixed to assure quality.
  - Merely testing the functionality of each component or system is not always sufficient
  - To meet the overall test objectives, you focus your testing on specific objectives at each level. 
    - To meet these specific objectives, you use different test types.
  - These test types are typically a set of test activities, focused on a specific objective, used to test different components and systems
    - Different tests enable you to meet each specific objective in different test phases
  - There are different test types:
    - Functional testing which tests the functionality of a selected component
    - Non-functional testing, this tests the behavioral, or the quantified characteristics, of the systems and software
    - Structural testing which tests the structural aspects of the component or system
    - Changed-based testing â€“ including regression and confirmation testing 
        - This involves the re-run of tests to ensure that the software is working correctly following changes
  - Functional testing is the process of testing a software product to determine its specified behavior or functionality
  -  As a functionality tester test the function that the component or system needs to perform
  - The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality standard 9216 regulates testing
  - Based on the standard, functional testing is also performed for various quality characteristics, such as
    - Suitability
      - Testing suitability involves testing the capability of the software product to provide an appropriate set of functions 
       for specified tasks and user objectives. Suitability testing determines if the product performs as expected for its intended use. 
    - Interoperability
      - Testing interoperability involves evaluating the capability of the system to interact with other specified components or systems.
    - Accuracy
      - Testing accuracy involves ensuring that faulty products do not leave the production line and cause errors during beta testing.
  - Functional testing is also performed for various quality characteristics, such as
    -
