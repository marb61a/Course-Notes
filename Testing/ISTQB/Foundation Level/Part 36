                    Course Notes Part 36


Tasks of a test leader and tester
  - A test team consists of a number of resources who perform a wide variety of roles. 
  - Some of these roles may not necessarily be utilized in many organizations. 
  - However, the roles that are common across test teams – regardless of the organization 
    - Are those of a test leader and a tester. 
    - A test leader is a skilled professional who manages the testing activities and its resources. 
    - The person who performs testing – such as system or component testing – is known as a tester.
  - These testing roles can be performed by anyone who has the skills and aptitude for software testing. 
  - It is not mandatory that testers be certified professionals. 
  - For example, a team leader who understands the test process can perform both roles
    - This is based on the project and organizational requirements. 
    - Factors such as resource requirements and project-delivery life cycle affect the distribution of roles in testing.
  - While analyzing test roles and activities, you should note that a test role is not the same as a test job. 
  - A role can be defined as one or many responsibilities to which an individual is assigned. 
  - An example of this is the role of a test leader. 
  - On the other hand, a test job is what an individual is employed to do. 
  - This job may consist of one or more roles. For example, a tester can also be a test leader.
  - Test leaders manage the test team. They plan, monitor, and implement the testing activities and tasks. 
    - They can also be test managers, test coordinators, test team leaders, and test program managers.
  - The tasks of a test leader are similar to those of a project manager. 
  - Because of this, a project manager, a development manager, or a quality assurance manager may perform the tasks of a test leader
    - This is depending on project requirements. 
    - However, in these cases, the level of independence is low. 
    - Also, non-testers who lead the test team may not have the knowledge and the skill set required to manage testing activities. 
    Test leaders must have the appropriate mindset and training to plan, monitor, and control testing effectively.

Tasks that a test leader performs are
  - Creating test policies and strategies
    - Test policy contains the rules of testing. 
    - For example, your software product is completely driven by its design statements. 
      - Here, as a test leader, you define a test policy that states the testers must always review the design documents before testing
    - Test strategy provides a high-level overview of the methods used to test the software. 
    - These test strategies are based on the approach you'd adopt for testing your product. 
      - For example, if an independent test team decides to perform system testing for a software product
        - Then you coordinate with the project managers and other stakeholders and create test strategies 
          - These must match the system-testing approach.
  - Selecting the testing tools and setting up the environment
    - The test leader determines the tools required for testing. 
    - These include spreadsheets, word processors, project planning tools, and non-IT tools and equipment. 
    - If required, the test leader should make arrangements for training the test team members for using these tools. 
    - For example, if your organization uses a defect-logging tool for the test team, as a test leader
      - You should ensure that the testers in your team are trained to use this tool.
    - Additionally, the test leader decides the structure and implementation of the test environment. 
      - The test environment consists of the supporting hardware and software required for running the tests.
  - Planning and managing the tests
    - The test leader selects appropriate test approaches; estimates the time, effort, and cost of testing; acquires resources; 
      - Defines test levels and cycles; and plans incident management. 
      - The test leader also manages the specification, preparation, implementation, and execution of tests. 
      - To analyze test specifications, the test leader analyzes, reviews, and assesses user requirements
        - Also design specifications, and test models.
    -For example, the test leader should determine the number of testers and the hours of effort required to test a specific application
  - Ensuring configuration management
    - Configuration management means identifying the items that make up software or comprise a system 
      - While ensuring that these items are managed carefully throughout the project and product life cycle. 
      - The test leader ensures appropriate configuration management of the testware created and traceability of the tests.
    - For example, to test a web service, you would need to analyze the elements that constitute this application
      - Such as the framework on which the application is built and its development environment.
