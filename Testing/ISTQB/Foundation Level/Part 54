Introducing a Tool into an Organization
Appropriate introduction of a test tool
  - When an organization or project team decides to buy a tool to complete a task, 
    - They should study the advantages and disadvantages of buying the tool.
  - The factors you should keep in mind before buying the tool are
    - Maturity of the internal test processes used
    - Availability of alternate solutions
    - Constraints faced and requirements specified
    - Availability of tools that meet these requirements
    - Detailed evaluation/proof of concept
    - Cost of the selected tool
  - Before buying a test tool, you should first identify the strengths and weaknesses of the test organization. 
  - You should introduce the tool only if it can support the established test processes. 
  - To evaluate whether your organization is ready for tools, you can use the Test Process Improvement (TPI) model 
    - Or the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) model. 
    - These models are software process improvement assessment models that can assess the maturity of an organization 
      - And provide guidelines for improving the test process.
  - It is a good practice to consider alternative solutions before investing in a tool. 
   - Trying out alternative solutions can sometimes be more beneficial for a test process than using a test tool 
    - Or automating an old test pack.
   - For example, your organization may require version management of its products. 
   - Instead of purchasing a configuration management test tool , you could look at alternative options, 
    - Such as purchasing a cheaper open source tool, or using internal employees to develop this tool.
  - After you've ensured that there are no alternative solutions available, you should consider 
    - The constraints and requirements of the tool.
  - The constraints could be financial or technical. 
    - The requirements could be about factors such as training needs or tool vendors' specifications. 
    - The requirements should be drawn up formally, prioritized and approved by the key stakeholders.
  - If you don't perform a detailed analysis of the need for the tool and specify the requirements and constraints, 
    - You could encounter problems such as delays, unnecessary expenditure, or inadequately equipped tools.
    - For example, you may require a tool that can be remotely accessed. 
      - The tool you adjudged to be the best after a series of demonstrations might not be deployable over the Internet. 
      - Purchasing the tool without understanding its constraints and your own requirements 
        - Would result in owning an inadequately equipped tool.
  - After specifying the requirements, next you should check if the available tools are capable of overcoming the constraints
    - And satisfying the requirements. If they are, shortlist them for purchase.
  - After you decide to purchase a tool, you can approach tool vendors, attend tool exhibitions
    - And search for tools on the Internet.
  - When discussing with vendors, you should ensure that you provide them with a list of the constraints 
    - And the requirements so they are clear about your requirements.
  - After you decide to buy a tool, it is important that you evaluate both the tool vendor and the tool. 
    - This evaluation is called a proof of concept. 
    - When you've shortlisted only one tool, you can combine the pilot project
      - Which is the first use trial project of the tool with the proof of concept
        - Which is the detailed evaluation of the tool before purchase.
  - During evaluation, you should evaluate the tool in the same test environment where the tool will be used. 
    - This ensures that you don't need to reconfigure the tool. 
    - For example, some static analysis tools don't support all versions of all programming languages
      - So you should test a static analysis tool in the programming language version you intend to use.
  - After completing the evaluation, you should again assess the tools against the requirements. 
    - If there are any additional features, you can note them as potential future requirements.
  - After evaluating the tool, you should negotiate the cost of the tool with its vendor. 
    - During the negotiation, you should discuss the purchase price, consultancy costs, training and implementation costs
      - And the annual license fees. 
      - You should also negotiate the costs regarding a pilot run of the tool 
        - And the costs associated with a large scale implementation of the tool.
  - After negotiating the costs, you should conduct a pilot project to test the tool. A pilot project helps you
    - Gain knowledge
      - You can gain knowledge through a pilot project when you test the tool and identify 
        - What the benefits and shortcomings of the tool are.
Assess compatibility
  - The pilot project helps you assess if the test tool is compatible with the existing processes.
    - Decide on process modifications
      - During the pilot, you can determine what processes and practices you would need to modify to accommodate the tool.
    - Decide on how to ensure people make optimum use of the tool
      - The pilot project helps you identify how people can make optimum use of the tool 
        - So existing processes can be streamlined.
    - Evaluate the benefits of the tool
      - During the pilot, you can evaluate if the benefits the tool promises can be achieved at a reasonable price. 
      - This will help in deciding whether you want to purchase the tool.
    - Determine other details for using the tool
    - The pilot project will also help you determine other details for using the tool. 
      - For example, you can identify the templates required and guidelines needed to use the tool.
If you're satisfied with the results of the pilot project, you should buy the tool. 
  - To implement the purchased tool, you should
    - Adopt an incremental approach
      - You should adopt an incremental approach by releasing the tool to the rest of the organization in phases. 
      After a pilot, you can release the tool into areas where it is likely to be more useful.
    - Adapt the tool to the existing processes
      - You should find the right balance for using the existing tools and practices with the new tool. 
      - You can do this by adapting the tool to the existing processes, old tools, and testware.
    - Use the test pilot data
      - You can use the test pilot data to create user guidelines that are to be used by the testing team.
    - Train employees
      - You should train employees on using the tool. This ensures that they are prepared to use the tool in a live project.
    - Create a database
      - You should compile a database of issues faced and learned based on the findings of the pilot. 
      - This ensures that the team will always have solutions to problems that have been encountered.
