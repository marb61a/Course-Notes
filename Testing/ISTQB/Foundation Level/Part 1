Application Development Lifecycle (ADLC)
The Application Development Lifecycle
  - Sometimes referred to as the System Development Lifecycle
  - It is a framework which describes development from start to fininish
  - It was created to optimise product development
  - It is broken down into multiple phases each with the own activities
  - These phases follow each other in order
  - Outputs from earlier phases are inputs into later phases
  - The phases are
    - Initiation where somebody comes up with a problem needing a solution
    - Concept takes the output from the initial phase to be fleshed out
      - There are several studies generated during this phase including cost-benefit analysis
    - Planning is the next phase where the concept has been handed over
      - It is at this point that Project Management tools will need to be implemented
      - This is where the practical resources needed are assigned
    - Analysis which is where the architectural and functional reequirements are generated
      - These requirements drive the development of the application
      - They are the basis for acceptance testing at project end
    - Design happens once analysis has been completed
      - This will be how the application is built
      - There are multiple documents used eg Mockups
    - Development phase is where the application design etc will be implemented
      - This will be done using several environments
      - This is where unit testing etc will be done
    - Validation is where the product is handed off to be tested
      - The software is ran against test cases to ensure robustness and meets requirements
    - Deployment is the phase entered when the application is deemed ready
      - It is here that the application is put into the production environment
      - This can be stepped in order to have a chance to resolve any issues from entering production
    - Production comes after deployment and the application will need support and maintenance
      - Other items are new features being sought or issues will production use
    - End of life is where the app is taken out of production
      - All data must be disposed of properly
  - There are often multiple SDLC cycles in an ADLC
  - Each application has its own SDLC

ADLC Startup Phases
  - The ADLC startup phases include Initiation, Concept & Planning phases
  - All start-up phases involve investigation and analysis
  - Inception is caused by an Idea, Problem or issue
  - The initiation phase is normally driven by a single sponsor
    - This will normally be a product manager
    - Analysis will uncover several possible approaches to solving the problem
    - It answers the question as to why the project should be done
  - The System Concept phase puts boundaries around the concept
    - Preliminary analysis is done to assess project viability
    - The analysis must be sent to stakeholders for inspection
    - If viable the project will be moved forward
    - Prior to project ramp-up intense planning must happen
  - Planning will be where resources are assessed and assigned
    - There are multiple environments needed eg Servers, Networks etc
    - Personnel including technical staff will have to be assigned
    - During this phase the project timeline will also have to be put in place
    - Budgets will need to be approved prior to ramp up
  - Each of the startup phase activities produces artifacts and documents
  - These artifacts are inputs for later parts of the ADLC
  - The concept proposal document tells stakeholders why the project should proceed
    - This is a document that requires a lot of work
    - The results of analysis are laid out in several support documents
      - Statement Of Work (SOW), Feasability Study, Cost Benefit Analysis, Risk Managemant Plan
      - Feability assesses a project from 5 viewpoints Legal, Technical, Operational, Economic, Scheduling
      - Another very important document is the market & competitive survey which shows whether there is a market 
      - The cost-benefit analysis shows whether the benefit to a company is greater than the cost of a product
        - It will indicate Return On Investment(ROI) is worth it and by how much
      - The Statement Of Work is the formal document which captures the project purpose
        - What it will require and deliver
        - It will create boundaries and can be used as a contract
  - The Project Management Plan will show several sections relating to the project
    - Project scope, cost, timeline with milestones
    - It also lays out project strategy and execution
