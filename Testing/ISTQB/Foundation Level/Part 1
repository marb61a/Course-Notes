Application Development Lifecycle (ADLC)
The Application Development Lifecycle
  - Sometimes referred to as the System Development Lifecycle
  - It is a framework which describes development from start to fininish
  - It was created to optimise product development
  - It is broken down into multiple phases each with the own activities
  - These phases follow each other in order
  - Outputs from earlier phases are inputs into later phases
  - The phases are
    - Initiation where somebody comes up with a problem needing a solution
    - Concept takes the output from the initial phase to be fleshed out
      - There are several studies generated during this phase including cost-benefit analysis
    - Planning is the next phase where the concept has been handed over
      - It is at this point that Project Management tools will need to be implemented
      - This is where the practical resources needed are assigned
    - Analysis which is where the architectural and functional reequirements are generated
      - These requirements drive the development of the application
      - They are the basis for acceptance testing at project end
    - Design happens once analysis has been completed
      - This will be how the application is built
      - There are multiple documents used eg Mockups
    - Development phase is where the application design etc will be implemented
      - This will be done using several environments
      - This is where unit testing etc will be done
    - Validation is where the product is handed off to be tested
      - The software is ran against test cases to ensure robustness and meets requirements
    - Deployment is the phase entered when the application is deemed ready
      - It is here that the application is put into the production environment
      - This can be stepped in order to have a chance to resolve any issues from entering production
    - Production comes after deployment and the application will need support and maintenance
      - Other items are new features being sought or issues will production use
    - End of life is where the app is taken out of production
      - All data must be disposed of properly
  - There are often multiple SDLC cycles in an ADLC
  - Each application has its own SDLC
