                    ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level
                    Course Notes Part 18


System and Acceptance Testing
  - Test the application as a single entity is called system testing.
  - During system testing, ensure that the application meets the requirements identified during the initial phases of the development process.
  - Also tested is whether the application can withstand potential risks, such as hacker and virus attacks.
    - Additionally, during this level of testing you determine whether the application can optimally utilize system resources.
  - System testing is typically conducted by a dedicated testing team.
    - To ensure that the implementation details are not known to the testers, they should not have worked on the development 
  - The objective of system testing is to verify that the system meets specified requirements
  - Requirements can be categorised into
    - Functional requirements
      - Functional requirements refer to the features and functions of the application.
      - Also consider the security mechanism of an application and its ability to interact with other systems as functional requirements.
    - Nonfunctional requirements
      - Nonfunctional requirements are those that are not related to specific functionality
      - Attributes such as usability, efficiency, reliability, maintainability or portability are nonfunctional
  - While testing functional requirements, you start with a specifications-based black box approach.
  - Black box testing is so called because it takes no interest in the internal structure of the system or component
  - White box, or glass box, is used to describe testing that is concerned with the internal workings of a system
  - While performing nonfunctional tests, you verify quality attribute requirements
  - The attributes, and their sub-attributes, tested for during nonfunctional requirements testing, are
    - Reliability, comprising robustness, fault-tolerance, recoverability and compliance
    - Efficiency, comprising speed, resource utilization, and compatibility
    - Usability, comprising comprehensibility, learnability, operability, appeal, and compliance
    - Maintainability, comprising analyzability, stability, changeability, testability and compliance
    - Portability, comprising adaptability, compatibility, installability, replaceability, and compliance
  - After successful system testing, you hand over the application to the client
  - For successful acceptance testing, you simulate the environment in which the application will run.
    - During acceptance testing, you determine whether an application
      - Meets all the specified requirements, is ready to be deployed and adversely affects existing applications and business operations
  - If an application fails an acceptance test, then unless the customer chooses to accept the defect, it needs to be fixed
  - You can categorize acceptance testing into various types:
    -user acceptance testing
      - The prospective users of an application conduct user acceptance testing. 
      - During this testing process, they check whether the application allows them to perform business tasks. 
    - operational acceptance testing
      - Operational acceptance testing is conducted by system administrators. 
      These administrators try to assess whether the application can be maintained easily and efficiently. 
    - contract acceptance testing
      - If you sign a contract with the client about the type of application you will create, 
      - The client conducts contract acceptance testing.
      - During this testing process, the client ensures that the application meets the acceptance criteria specified in the contract. 
    - regulation acceptance testing
      - To ensure that an application complies with standard government, legal, and safety regulations, 
      - The client conducts regulation acceptance testing.
  - Two other types of acceptance testing are alpha and beta testing
  - During the alpha testing process, your team and a group of prospective customers check an application 
    - This is to ensure that it meets all specified requirements.
    - You perform alpha testing at your site.
  - After successful alpha testing, you send the application to another set of prospective customers for beta testing
    - This helps to simulate a real-world environment
    - These customers check whether the application meets their needs and report problems to you
  - Acceptance testing is often the last test level. 
    - However, you can also perform acceptance testing at other stages of the development process
