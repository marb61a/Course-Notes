                    Course Notes Part 38


Components and kinds of test plans
  - Software testing plays a major role in the software development process. 
  - Inadequate test planning can place an entire project's success at risk. 
  - The software test planning process includes organizing test activities, id'ing resources, and assigning responsibilities 
  - You also need to list the test procedures, strategy, schedule, and deliverables in the planning stage.
  - You use the Test Plan document as a tool to plan the testing process for the software.
  - In the Software Test Plan document, you describe the objectives, scope, approach, and focus of a software testing process
  - A test plan also identifies the test environment, the design techniques, and identifies any risks involved in testing.
  - Using the test plan, you can then communicate the test details to all the members of a project team. 
  - It helps them identify the test items, the testing tasks, and their responsibilities.
  - You plan a test in the early stages of a test project. 
  - However, as the project progresses, you can update your test plan according to changes and requirements of the project. 
    - You can also write multiple test plans if the project is dynamic and involves continuous changes.
  - However, writing multiple test plans can lead to information overlapping 
    - This information redundancy causes unexpected discrepancies in the plan statements. 
    - Therefore, it is better to write a single master test plan that addresses the common topics.
  - The IEEE 829 Standard for Software Test Documentation provides a template with standardized methods for performing tests 
    - This helps you write, record, and track the tests throughout the life of a project.
  - A Standard Test Plan template contains 16 sections. 
    - These sections define the requirements of a project plan. 
    - Performing the test process according to the content in these sections enables you to meet the objectives 
      - This is with the available resources and within a stipulated time frame.
  - You can use the various sections provided by the IEEE 829 Standard Test Plan template to
    - Identify the test plan
      - You can use the test plan identifier section to provide a unique number that identifies the test level
        - The software associated with the test plan, and the current version of the test plan.
    - Provide introduction
      - In the introduction section, you can include the project scope description to identify the key features of a project.
      - You can also specify the plan scope to address the different levels of testing.
  - List test items
    - You can list the items that need to be tested, such as source code and control data, in the test items section. 
    - The section also includes references to the design and requirement specifications.
  - List features to be tested
    - You can include a list of product features that might be required by the user in this section. 
    - For example, different users may require different performance and functionality levels. 
    - You can include these features in the test plan so that they can be tested.
  - Include features not to be tested
    - In this section, you can include information about the features that do not require testing 
      - Also provide reasons for their exclusion. 
      - For example, when a feature involves low risk and is not tested, it is listed in this section.
The other sections in the IEEE 829 Standard Test Plan template help you provide information such as the
  - Testing approach
    - The testing approach or strategy is the most important section of a test plan. 
    - You include well-defined information regarding the testing approach 
      - And identify factors that may affect the success of that approach in this section.
  - Pass or fail criteria of test items
    - You can add the pass/fail criteria of test items based on the number and severity of errors and their locations 
      - In the product under testing. However, these test criteria may differ from one organization to another.
  - Suspension and resumption criteria
    - You can include info regarding the suspension + resumption criteria when you need to suspend or restart testing process. 
  - Test deliverables
    - In this section, you can provide a list of all documents, tools, and components to be developed for the testing effort.
    - Some test deliverables are test design specifications, custom tools, and simulators.
  - Test tasks
  - You can identify a set of tasks required for planning and performing a test in the test tasks section. 
    - The test tasks section can also include details about the inter-task dependencies and the skills required to test.
  - Other sections of the template include
    - Environmental needs
      - You can include the testing environment requirements such as hard/software, interfaces
        - Also include security access in the environmental needs section.
    - Responsibilities
      - To specify the responsibilities of the people involved in the test and the tasks they perform
      - Use the responsibilities section. 
        - This section also includes information on the responsibility criteria of those who establish the test environment 
        - And also manage the software configuration.
    - Staffing and training needs
      - You choose the testing staff and train them based on the skill requirements for a particular testing process. 
      - In the staffing and training needs section, you can list the skill requirements and the training required for them 
    - Schedule
      - You include key milestones of the test project plan such as document delivery dates and available resources 
    - Risks and contingencies
      - You can list project risks such as budget and resource availability, and contingency plans associated with these 
    - Approvals
      - Using the approvals section, you collect the signatures of those who are responsible for final approval of testing 
      - These individuals possess the authority to accept or reject the terms of a software document 
        - This is if they feel that the software requirements are not adequate.
  - You can easily remember the 16 sections of the IEEE 829 Standard Test Plan template by using the acronym 'SPACEDIRT'. 
    - The letters in the acronym stand for 
      - Scope, People, Approach, Criteria, Environmental needs, 
        - Deliverables, Test Plan identifier and Introduction, Risks, and Testing Tasks.
