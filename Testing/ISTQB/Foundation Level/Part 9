General Software Testing Principles 
  - Software testing is based on certain principles that have evolved over the years.
  - These principles guide testers and reduce software related problems.
  - There are seven principles of software testing.
    - testing shows presence of defects – Principle One
    - exhaustive testing is impossible – Principle Two
    - confusing an absence of errors with product fit is a fallacy – Principle Three
  - The first principle states that running tests on software will discover defects
    - The absence of defects does not mean that the software is defect free
    - These tests also decrease the possibility that the software still contains defects,
  - The second principle states that it's impossible to conduct exhaustive testing.
    - Exhaustive testing can be defined as a test approach in which all possible data inputs and preconditions are used.
    - Testing every data input and precondition of software is not feasible
    - Exhaustive testing is possible only when the application under test (AUT) is based on simple logic
  - The third principle outlines the absence-of-errors fallacy. 
    - It states that although testing might succeed in locating and correcting all possible defects in the software
      - The software itself might not be fit for use by an end user.
