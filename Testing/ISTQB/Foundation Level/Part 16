Software Testing and Development Models (Continued)
  - The main drawback of the waterfall model is that it incorporates testing toward the end of the development life cycle
  - Because the code for the product is too complex at this stage, fixing bugs or defects in the product can be time consuming
    - While fixing the bugs, you can introduce new bugs in the product.
  - To overcome the drawbacks of the waterfall model, divide the development of the product into various stages 
    - Perform a testing activity at the end of each stage
  - This division of development and testing activities can help identify bugs early where fixes are easier
  - The V-model is a sequential model that improves upon the waterfall model. 
    - In the V-model, the development team first identifies client and system requirements
    - Then an overall and detailed design is created
    - The testing team review the documents generated at the end of these processes
    - Simultaneously plan for the testing activity is going on
    - As the product is progressively developed, the other testers test it
    - Here though divide the testing into four test levels.
      - Component testing
        - During component testing,test each component of your product for defects and fix any defects immediately.
        - Use the detailed design of the product as the basis for creating a component-testing plan.
      - Integration testing
        - Integration testing is used to test the interrelationships between the components of the product
        - During integration testing, you determine whether the components interact correctly with each other
        - To create an integration-testing plan, you refer to the overall design of the product.
      - System testing
        - Before beginning system testing, developers integrate all the components and build a functional software product. 
        - It exhibits the desired features and functions and performs without any evidence that there are defects present.
        - A system-testing plan is created based on the system requirements.
      - Acceptance testing
        - Acceptance testing is conducted by the representatives of the client. 
        - The representatives may either test the product at your site or test it after you've delivered it to them. 
        - Their main objective during acceptance testing is to determine whether the product meets all their requirements.
        - You create an acceptance-testing plan after the client's requirements have been identified.
  - In the V-model, you test the product at each stage of development. 
    - The outcome of each stage id released to the next stage only when all identified defects have been fixed.
  - The iterative development model eliminates the drawback of the V-model. 
    - In the iterative model, developers build a product using a series of iterative steps. 
    - Each step consists of four tasks â€“ Identify requirements, Create a design, Create code, and Test code. 
    - The testers, are part of the development process, they are able to test the product while it is being developed, 
  - In the iterative model, representatives of your client can participate in the testing process at the end of each step. 
  - The representatives can also suggest changes to the product during development.
  - If you use the iterative model, you don't prepare formal documents before you begin development
  - The iterative model also has its drawbacks. These drawbacks can adversely affect the testing process.
      - Two significant drawbacks of the iterative model are absence of formal documentation
      - In the absence of formal documentation, you can't verify requirements accurately. 
  - Compared to the other models, the iterative model can increase testing time and cost. 
  - The waterfall model is a sequential software development model. In this model, you build and then test a software product.
  - The V-model is a customized version of the waterfall model. 
    - In this model, you combine the testing process with the software-development process. 
    - This ensures that you test each component, feature, and function of your product as it is built.
  - The V-model and the iterative model are not stringent and you can modify them to suit your requirements.
  - You can also customize the order in which you perform the four test levels,
