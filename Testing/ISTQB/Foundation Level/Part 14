                    Course Notes Part 14

CTFL: Test Process Fundamentals
  - There is no single universal test process
  - There are a number of test activities which make up each test process
  - Test Processes make test objectives measureable and achievable
  - Choosing the appropriate process depends on a number of factors
  - Included in the dependent factors is situation and context
  - The What, When and How are included in strategy
  - Some of the contextual factors that affect test strategy are
    - SDLM and project methodologies
    - Business Domain
    - Test levels and test types
    - Operational constraints
    - Project and product risk factors
    - Required internal and external standards
    - Organisational practices and policies
  - General aspects of the test process
    - Test work products
    - Test activities and tasks
    - Traceability between test basis and work products
  - Test basis should have measurable coverage criteria defined
    - This is true for any type or level of test being contemplated
    - Coverage criteria can serve as a KPI
  - Test Phases
    - Test Planning
      - Test planning comprises activities
      - They define test objectives
      - That define the approach to meeting the test objectives
      - The Test Plan may be adjusted based on feedback from monitoring and control activities
    - Test Monitoring and control
      - Test Monitoring is the on-going comparison between actual progress and the test plan
        - Uses Test Monitoring metrics as defined in the Test Plan
      - Test Control is to identify and take action as required to meet stated objectives in the test plan
        - It involves taking corrective action
      - It is supported by exit criteria evaluation
        - Sometimes referred to as the definition of done in some SDLM
    - Test Analysis
      - During Test Analysis the test basis is analysed 
        - To determine testable features
        - To define associated test conditions
      - It answers the question what is to be tested
      - Key activities are related to the analysis of the test basis
    - Test Design
      - Test conditions are described in terms of
        - High level test cases
        - Sets of high level test cases
        - Other types of testware
      - It answers the question how to test
      - The activities include
        - Design and prioritise test cases and sets of test cases
        - Specify the required test data
        - Design the test environment
        - Capturing bi-directional traceability
    - Test Implementation
      - Testware is required for test execution
      - Test cases are created for test procedures
      - The key activities include
        - Develop and priotitize procedures
        - Create test suites
        - Build the test environment
        - Test data should be prepared and loaded
        - Confirm  bi-directional traceability
