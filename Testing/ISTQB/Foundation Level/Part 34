                    Course Notes Part 34


The models that are used while developing the system
  - The choice of testing technique would depend on the software model 
    - This is used during specification, design, development, and implementation of the system. 
    - For example, if the spec requires testing various cases with different possible outcomes
      - Then use the decision table testing technique.
  - Knowledge and experience of the tester
    - The knowledge, skill, and experience of the tester is another factor that influences the choice of test techniques. 
    - If you want to test a system based on equivalence partitioning and boundary values 
      - And if the tester is an expert in boundary-value analysis, 
      - You might decide to perform boundary-value analysis testing instead of equivalence testing.
  - Potential defects
    - Based on past experience, if you know that certain defects are likely to be present in the system, 
    - It will be easier to select the test technique. 
    - You can find the areas with likely defects if you have experience with similar applications or technology. 
    - For example, if you have tested the previous version of an application, 
      - you can use that experience to discover likely errors in the current version.
  - Test objective
    - The test technique you select also depends on the test objective. 
    - Suppose you've created a financial application and you want to test whether it functions as expected. 
      - You decide employ the use-cases approach. 
      - If you want to perform complete and rigorous testing, you use structure-based techniques.
  - Documentation
    - The extent and style of documentation plays an important role in determining the test technique. 
    - If the specifications are missing or aren't well documented, you use an experience-based test approach. 
    - However, if the specifications are detailed and contain diagrams that explain state transition, 
      - You would use the state transition testing technique.
  - Lifecycle model
    - Your choice of test technique depends on the testing life cycle model you use. 
    - If you are using the iterative life cycle model where you have to test various values in a loop structure, 
      - Exploratory testing should be used. 
      - But if you are using the sequential model, you can test the application using structure-based techniques.
  - In addition to the internal factors, various external factors affect the choice of test techniques. They are
    - Risk
      - The risk involved in testing safety-critical systems, such as radiation therapy machines, is very high. 
        - So you need to devise structure-based testing techniques to thoroughly test the application. 
      - There could also be an associated commercial risk involving quality or time-to-market issues, 
        - So you use exploratory testing to test the application.
    - Contractual Requirements
      - Your company has signed a contractual agreement with the client to test their software applications. 
      - The contract specifies that you need to use boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning techniques. 
      - Even though other techniques, such as decision and path testing would equally be suitable
      - You have to use the technique stipulated in the contract.
    - Type of System
      - The type of test technique you use also depends on the type of systems, such as an embedded or a financial system. 
      - Suppose you're testing a loan application and want to test the various conditions for approving loan amounts. 
      - You also want to test the outcomes of all the conditions. 
      - In such a situation, you use the decision-table testing technique.
    - Regulatory Requirements
      - Some industries have regulatory guidelines that form a basis for choosing test techniques. 
      - For example, the medical industry might require the use of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis 
        - For testing life-critical medical software systems. 
        - So you use these techniques in addition to structure-based techniques, such as decision coverage and path testing.
    - Time and Cost
      - If you have sufficient time and if the required budget is sanctioned, 
      - You can use a combination of different test techniques. 
      - But if time and budget are limited, you might use the one technique, such as experience-based testing, 
        - If that best meets the requirements of the application.
