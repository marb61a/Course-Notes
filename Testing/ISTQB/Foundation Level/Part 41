                    Course Notes Part 41


Entry and exit criteria in software testing
  - Entry criteria are used to establish the conditions and timing for a given test activity to commence.  
  - This may include when to start test design, when to start a new level of testing or when to start test execution. 
  - Without such criteria, certain test activities may begin at an inappropriate time, using valuable resources, 
    - This in turn wastes time and money on a project.
  - Usual entry criteria include:
      - Test environment availability
        - Test environment availability indicates that any system that will be used for testing purposes 
          - Is accessible to those that are doing the testing.  
      - Test tools installed and available in test environment
    - In addition to ensuring that the test environment is available
    - The environment must also include the test tools installed and configured according to the specifications outlined 
    - For example, if the software test plan calls for the use of a particular test tool
      - That tool must be installed and configured explicitly for testing purposes.
  - Code is available for testing
    - The code must be available to testers in order to perform the required tests according to the test plan.  
    - For example, to perform static testing, testers will commonly use a compile environment to ensure syntax validity.  
      - Without the code, this test would be impossible.
  - Test data available and ready to use
    - This type of entry criteria ensures that the test data indicted by the test plan 
      - Has been entered in the required environment and is ready to use for testing.  
      - For example, if the software to be tested interfaces with a relational database
        - The data required in order to run the tests must already exist in the database
  - Test design activity is complete
    - In order to carry out testing effectively with no wasted effort
      - It is essential that the test conditions (coverage items) for a test item
      - The detailed approach and associated high level test cases are fully documented and complete.  
      - For example, if the test condition calls for a certain approach in testing
        - And a different approach was employed instead
          - All testing performed using the erroneous approach would likely amount to wasted effort.
  - Even though you may use all the indicated and appropriate strategies
    - Inadequate requirements or resources may force you to stop testing a project. 
    - To prevent this, you must ensure that your test meets the conditions of exit criteria for successful completion.
  - Exit criteria identify any inadequacies and incomplete testing tasks during project execution. 
  - For example, an exit criteria condition may require you to check 
    - If any severe defects are left outstanding before testing can be formally considered complete.
  - There are various types of exit criteria. You may classify them as
  - Defects
    - When testing a project, the exit criteria for defects require you to meet certain conditions
    - For example, that high priority errors must be rectified and retested. 
    - This helps you ensure that no critical outstanding errors are present in a project before releasing it.
  - Coverage
    - You can improve the quality of a project by maximizing the test coverage. 
    - Test coverage covers all the test levels. Exit criteria for test coverage include conditions. 
    - For example, they may include a condition that says 85% of requirements coverage 
      - Is to be achieved in order for a test to be considered complete.
  - Quality
    - Exit criteria provide an effective method for managing the quality of a project. 
    - You can use exit criteria to ensure that you have successfully completed a test 
      - And the outcomes are of acceptable quality. 
    - For example, the criteria for quality may require you to execute maximum test cases 
      - With an item pass rate of not less than 80%.
  - Budget
    - You can stop testing when the budget for the test is exhausted. 
    - Exit criteria determine when to stop according to available funding. 
    - Using these criteria, you can also rectify your test plan to complete the test within the specified budget.
  - Risk
    - Using exit criteria, you can ensure that all potential areas of risk such as technical risks are completely tested. 
    - Exit criteria determine the product features at risk which allow you to leave the low risk areas untested if necessary.
  - Different exit criteria relate to different levels of testing. 
  - For example, checking whether a project is code complete 
    - And there are no missing features or media elements is considered component testing. 
    - Testing whether a product runs on all the supported hard and software configurations is considered system testing.
  - You can check whether the outcomes are of acceptable quality by using acceptance testing. 
  - Integration testing requires the software product to be compatible with and installable on all other related systems. 
  - If a product is approved and signed off by product marketing
    - The performance of the product is confirmed and approved by functional testing.
