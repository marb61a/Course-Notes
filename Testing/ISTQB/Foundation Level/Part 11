                    Course Notes Part 11


The Psychology of Software Testing
  - There are many factors that affect software testing
  - Psychological factors are important, because they influence the success of the testing activity
  -  How an individual identifies and reports defects, how evidence is gathered and shared is determined by psychology
    - This is also true of how results are communicated and interpreted
  - The psychological make up of a developer differs from that of a tester
    - This influences the process of testing.
  - Testing requires an objective mindset which exists only if the person testing the product is not personally attached to the product
  - Testing activities should be assigned to someone who was not part of the software development process.
  - This ensures separation of responsibilities between a tester and a developer, called independence.
  - Independence in software testing introduces objectivity and adds value
    - This is because if prevents author-induced biases from creeping in and allowing valid defects to be reported
  - You can implement different levels of testing independence at different stages of the development life cycle
  - There are four basic levels of independence – graded from high to low – in software testing.
    - The grade of independence depends on the degree of responsibilities
    - Software Developer 
      - When the developer who created the software tests his own software, the level of testing independence obtained is minimal.
      - There is no actual separation of duties here, because the tester and the developer are the same person
    - Peer reviewer
      - The second level of testing independence is when a peer within the team reviews the product or application
      - This person brings a fresh perspective to the testing and tends to be more objective than the product author
      - Typically, peers are members from the same development team
    - Internal Tester
      - A higher level of testing independence with improved objectivity, involves an internal tester from a different functional group
      - This is the preferred and most common level of testing independence employed by most organizations
    - Third-party reviewer
      - The highest and the fourth level of testing independence
      - It is achieved when a third-party reviewer – usually a certified tester from a different organization – tests your software.
      - Although expensive, this level provides optimum results in a test scenario, providing maximum separation of responsibilities
  - Although objectivity is critical during software testing, sometimes developers test their products due to constraints
  - In these cases, the developer must adopt the mindset of a tester – to look consciously for defects – for testing to be effective.
  - The primary advantages of self-review include early defect detection and prevention and cost effectiveness
    - However, higher levels of independence in testing produce more effective results
  - An overlooked but equally important component affecting testing is communication.
  - Because software testing includes the participation of multiple team they must communicate with each other as seamlessly as possible
  - How the testing team communicates its test results to the development team is equally critical.
  - A tester's mindset is to look for defects in a product, and when they find them; their role in the process is justified.
    - This can affect the tone used when they log defects.
    - A harsh tone can make a developer defensive.
  - For communication among team members during the test process to be effective, it is important to communicate
    - Defects and incidents neutrally
      - The chances of test results being taken positively by the development team increase if communicated properly
        - Defects and incidents should be communicated in an objective manner. 
      - Defects should be recorded without attributing the cause to the person who worked on it or undermining efforts
    - How the end user benefits
      - For successful software development and testing, keep in mind the requirements and the benefits to the end user
      - Communicating how the defects observed can impact end-user experience, provides objectivity to the test process
      - It should also be emphasized how the defect prevents the product from meeting its stated objective
    - The need for collaboration
      - The test process benefits from team effort, with the test and development teams collaborating effectively
      - In addition to achieving end-user satisfaction, working in a collaborating team helps you detect and fix defects
      - Collaboration requires you to share your observations and suggestions with your team and receive feedback
  - As a tester, you should remember and understand the objectives and the stakeholder requirements defined for the testing process
    - The project and the test process are driven by these factors, and test plans are based on them
    - Understanding these factors helps you adopt the right perspective while testing.
    - Testers must be able to identify what is critical and what is not while reporting defects.
