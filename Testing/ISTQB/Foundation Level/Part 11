The Psychology of Software Testing
  - There are many factors that affect software testing
  - Psychological factors are important, because they influence the success of the testing activity
  -  How an individual identifies and reports defects, how evidence is gathered and shared is determined by psychology
    - This is also true of how results are communicated and interpreted
  - The psychological make up of a developer differs from that of a tester
    - This influences the process of testing.
  - Testing requires an objective mindset which exists only if the person testing the product is not personally attached to the product
  - Testing activities should be assigned to someone who was not part of the software development process.
  - This ensures separation of responsibilities between a tester and a developer, called independence.
  - Independence in software testing introduces objectivity and adds value
    - This is because if prevents author-induced biases from creeping in and allowing valid defects to be reported
  - You can implement different levels of testing independence at different stages of the development life cycle
  - There are four basic levels of independence – graded from high to low – in software testing.
    - The grade of independence depends on the degree of responsibilities
    - Software Developer 
      - When the developer who created the software tests his own software, the level of testing independence obtained is minimal.
      - There is no actual separation of duties here, because the tester and the developer are the same person
    - Peer reviewer
      - The second level of testing independence is when a peer within the team reviews the product or application
      - This person brings a fresh perspective to the testing and tends to be more objective than the product author
      - Typically, peers are members from the same development team
    - Internal Tester
      - A higher level of testing independence with improved objectivity, involves an internal tester from a different functional group
