Agile Software Models
  - Agile models are lightweight, they display iteratie adaptive characteristics
  - They are less formal with less documentation and can adapt to the quick changes inherent in SW development
  - SDLC is iterated through multiple time but adherence to phases is not rigid
  - Phases may be accelerated or bypassed
  - Each cycle adds a small piece of functionality to the project
  - The new features are developed, tested and shown to the customer
  - Comments will be noted to influence requirements in later cycles
  - Proponents of different Agile models met in 2001 to find commonalities
    - This resulted in the Agile manifesto
  - The Agile Manifesto demonstrates the value added in all Agile models
  - The Agile methods value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Others are working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Change response over the following of a plan
  - Agile methods are characterized by an inspect and adapt mindset, which makes them highly flexible
  - These methods excel in helping businesses respond to risky projects
  - The different Agile software processes share some common practices
  - Many of them use a test first concept called Test Driven Development
    - This is where unit tests are written prior to features
