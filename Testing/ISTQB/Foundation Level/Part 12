Contrasting Software Developers and Testers
  - The success of software testing is dependent on effective communication across different teams 
  - As a software tester, you need to interact with the programmers or developers, who build the software applications 
    - This interaction drives the entire process, helping achieve the project goals and objectives. 
    - Project objectives drive the test plans
    - To understand these objectives thoroughly, developers and testers need to interact with one another seamlessly.
  - The interaction between the testers and the developers are influenced by numerous factors 
    â€“ psychological differences, roles and responsibilities in the testing process, and more.
  - The roles and responsibilities of testers and developers impact their differing attitudes toward testing.
  - There are basic differences in the mindset of testers and that of developers.
    - A tester tests the product for defects, keeping in mind the complete picture of the development life cycle 
      - Consequently, they are most likely to locate defects in the product.
    - A developer is usually an expert in a specific technical domain. 
      - Developers understand how a specific development model works
      - However, because they delve deeply in their domains, they may lose perspective of the complete picture
  - Testers should display competence by thoroughly understanding the objectives and requirements of the application. 
  - In doing so, they should get the developer's perspective so they know what is critical and valid. 
    - This understanding is reflected in the test cases and in the nature of defects reported. 
  - In addition, testers should demonstrate maturity and integrity in communicating defects
  - The mindset of testers is to look at products being tested as flawed
    - They design test suites to detect defects instead of designing test cases that only check if something works.
  - The differing mindsets of the testers and developers can lead to misunderstandings and communication gaps 
  - There are ways that testers and developers can bridge this gap
    - Understand and appreciate each other's roles and responsibilities in the testing process
    - Communicate and coordinate with one another throughout the development and testing life-cycle
    - Initiate conversations with the programmers, as testers, and not wait for them to start inquiring about defect reports
    - Share plans, drafts, schedule, design documents, and prototypes to stay updated of the process
    - Provide fair feedback to the developers, appreciating their good work and reporting defects objectively
