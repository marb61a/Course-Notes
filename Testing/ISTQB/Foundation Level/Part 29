State Transition Software Testing
  - A software application can be in various states depending on the action its user performs. 
  - As a software tester, you need to check if state transitions occur correctly. 
  - This type of testing is known as state transition testing.
  - State transition testing is based on the assumption that each application has a finite number of states, 
    - That the transition from one state to another depends on the objectives of the application. 
    - Applications with finite states are known as Finite State Machines.

To test if changes in states are accurate
  - To test state transitions of an application, you create a state transition model. 
  - This model contains four components:
    - States
      - You include all states possible in the application. 
    - Events
      - Events are user actions, such as a button click or text input, that trigger a state transition. 
    - Transitions
      - A transition is the process where an application changes from one state to another when an event is performed. 
      - You use arrows to depict transitions.
    - Outcomes
      - An outcome is a state that is the result of a transition. 
      - Outcomes are displayed near the arrowheads of transition arrows.
  - To test an application using the state transition model
    - You perform the possible events from all states to check if they change the application's state accurately.
    - In some cases, the same event can trigger different changes. 
    - You should also check if an event triggers an appropriate change depending on the current state of the application.

Using use cases to test software
  - It's a good practice to test software applications by operating them as end users. 
  - To do this, software testers usually create use cases. 
  - A use case is a scenario that contains a series of realistic tasks that users will frequently perform when using the app
    - For a web browser, for example, you can create a use case scenario for a beginner who wants to open a web page 
    - Similarly, you can create another use case scenario for an advanced user who wants to activate the pop-up blocker 
  - In addition to tasks, use cases include the outcome expected from the system for each task. 
  - In the use case for the advanced user, 
    - For example, an expected outcome can be that a message appears 
    - Informing the user that pop-ups for the currently open web site have been blocked.
  - Use cases should also include error handling methods, which are alternate outcomes for tasks not performed correctly. 
  - In use case modeling, an actor is any person, external system or event that interacts with the solution through a use case
  -  Actors should also be given unique names that describe the role they play in interactions with the system.
  - Testers will monitor the outcome of interactions between various software components
    - Helping to find integration errors caused by incorrect interactions between components. 
  - You can use a table to build a use case. 
    - In this table, you can specify imperative tasks using appropriate verbs and nouns.
    - For example, to create the beginner's use case for the web browser, you specify three tasks for the actor – 
      - Type a web address and press the Enter key, 
      - Click the Add to Bookmarks button, and Type a name for the bookmark and click the Save button. 
      - You enter each task in alternate rows.
  - You then write the successful outcomes expected from the system for each task 
    – The web page opens, The Add Bookmark dialog box opens with the web address entered
    - And The Bookmark name is visible in the Bookmarks list. You enter each outcome in the row below its corresponding task.
  - The column that contains the tasks and their successful outcomes is known as the Main Success Scenario.
  - You then write the possible error handling methods in a new column.
  - You can also use adverbs and adjectives in the outcome statements to describe how each outcome should occur.
