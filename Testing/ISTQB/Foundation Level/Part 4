                    ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level
                    Course Notes Part 4


SDLC Validation Phase
  - The Validation phase begins when the engineering software is delivered to the QA test engineers
    - This is a complete working application
  - The delivered application is tested in an isolated environment
  - Development does not have access to the test environment, 
    - The only way to get code installed on it, is to formally deliver it to the QA team.
  - QA testing is performed on the entire application
  - The majority of test cases will ensure the software satisfies the functional and system requirements
  - Each test case should trace back to one or more requirements
    - All requirements should be covered by at least one test case. 
  - Validation occurs after the Development phase and feeds into the Deployment phase. Execute Test Cases
  - Executing a test case is a rigid process
    - The environment must first be set in a known state detailed in the test case
  - The test case steps are executed in the order defined. 
  - The expected outputs will be listed, which the tester will compare against the behavior of the application. 
    -  If the behavior matches the expected result, the test passes else the test fails
  - The development team will modify the software to fix the defects as they are received
    - When enough bugs have been fixed to warrant a new version of the software a new baseline is set-up
    - A new revision is built and delivered to the QA team
  - Once the new software is installed, the testers must do a round of regression testing
    - Re-running all previous tests to ensure the modifications did not break working code.
    - If there is no recurrence the issue is closed
  - At any time, the number of open defects is a metric that indicates the stability of the application
    - This will also show how well it satisfies the requirements
  - When the number of open defects reaches a threshold, this indicates the software is ready for production, 
    - the QA team conducts user acceptance testing with the customer. 
    - If the customer agrees the software satisfies the requirements, they sign off on the project
    - Then the software can move to deployment.
  - There are a couple of artifacts produced in the phase
    - Test Analysis Reports. which include test case results indicating pass or fail
      - Also included is a list of prioritized open defects.
    - The other artifact produced in the Validation phase, is the validated software which is ready for production.
    
SDLC Deployment Phase
  - In the Deployment phase, the software is transformed into a product, and installed in the production environment
  - The transformation of validated engineering code into production software, takes the work and support of many departments
  - The main work of the software developers and testers is done so they will start to transition to new projects
  - Often internal and external acceptance testing will be conducted with small focus groups
    - The is to find any lingering issues before full production.
  - Alpha tests are known as internal acceptance testing, conducted in-house at the site of the developer
    - The testers can consist of small groups of customers, interested in the release, or an independent test team.
    - An environment is setup to simulate the production environment, where alpha testers can interact with the software
  - Beta tests are known as external user acceptance testing
    - The software is released to a limited group of customers to test in their own environment
  - Developers and QA are heavily involved during alpha and beta testing, to document, fix, and verify any bugs found
  - When all rounds of acceptance testing are complete, the software will be deployed into production
  - There are two types of production software, each with its own different production environment and support needs.
  - A managed system is installed in a company's IT environment and accessed by many users. 
    - This could be either an internal or external system
    - Example of internal system is a CRM system, an example of an externale facing system is a website
  - The other type is Production software that will be sold as an off-the-shelf software product
    - This requires more packaging than managed system but no requiring the company provide an operational environment
    - This is becuase the product will be installed at the customer's site.
  - Production software is accompanied by many artifacts, which help transform it from validated code into a product.
    - Some examples include installation aids or scripts, user manuals, readme files, installation instructions etc
  - A large enterprise managed system, will also be accompanied by operation and maintenance support documents
    - This tells support personnel how to configure and administer the running system
  - Marketing artifacts will include brochures and promotional material to handout at conferences and stores
  - If the system is especially complex there maybe white papers written
