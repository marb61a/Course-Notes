                    Course Notes Part 4


SDLC Validation Phase
  - The Validation phase begins when the engineering software is delivered to the QA test engineers
    - This is a complete working application
  - The delivered application is tested in an isolated environment
  - Development does not have access to the test environment, 
    - The only way to get code installed on it, is to formally deliver it to the QA team.
  - QA testing is performed on the entire application
  - The majority of test cases will ensure the software satisfies the functional and system requirements
  - Each test case should trace back to one or more requirements
    - All requirements should be covered by at least one test case. 
  - Validation occurs after the Development phase and feeds into the Deployment phase. Execute Test Cases
  - Executing a test case is a rigid process
    - The environment must first be set in a known state detailed in the test case
  - The test case steps are executed in the order defined. 
  - The expected outputs will be listed, which the tester will compare against the behavior of the application. 
    -  If the behavior matches the expected result, the test passes else the test fails
  - The development team will modify the software to fix the defects as they are received
    - When enough bugs have been fixed to warrant a new version of the software a new baseline is set-up
    - A new revision is built and delivered to the QA team
  - Once the new software is installed, the testers must do a round of regression testing
    - Re-running all previous tests to ensure the modifications did not break working code.
    - If there is no recurrence the issue is closed
  - At any time, the number of open defects is a metric that indicates the stability of the application
    - This will also show how well it satisfies the requirements
  - When the number of open defects reaches a threshold, this indicates the software is ready for production, 
    - the QA team conducts user acceptance testing with the customer. 
    - If the customer agrees the software satisfies the requirements, they sign off on the project
    - Then the software can move to deployment.
  - There are a couple of artifacts produced in the phase
    - Test Analysis Reports. which include test case results indicating pass or fail
      - Also included is a list of prioritized open defects.
    - The other artifact produced in the Validation phase, is the validated software which is ready for production.
