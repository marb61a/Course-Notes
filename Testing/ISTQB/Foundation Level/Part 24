Inspection Review
  - The inspection review is the most formal typically of the reviews.
  - The main purpose of an inspection review is to detect potential defects
    - To evaluate the quality, and at the same time build confidence in the work product, 
    - To prevent similar defects in the future via author learning. 
    - The more that the author learns through the inspection review, the less likely that the same mistakes will be made again 
    - By getting to the root cause of the defect, you remove all possibility of that ever happening again in the future 
  - Additional objectives of an inspection review include motivating and enabling authors to improve future work products 
    - To improve the software development process overall. 
    - Another potential objective is to achieve consensus on the work product. 
    - Properties of inspection reviews include, they follow predefined processes with formal documented outputs that are based on rules 
  - An inspection review also uses clearly defined roles 
    - It may include a dedicated reader whose job is to read the work product aloud during the review meeting. 
    - Prior individual preparation for an inspection review is mandatory. 
    - Reviewers are either peers of the author or experts in some other related discipline that's relevant to the work product. 
    - Additional properties of inspection reviews include the fact that entry and exit criteria are used
    - The scribe is mandatory for the review, and not the author. It should never be the author. 
    - The review must be led by a trained facilitator.
    - The author cannot act as the review leader, the reader, or the scribe. 
    - Potential defect logs and review reports are generated and metrics are collected 
      - They are used to improve the entire overall software development process, including the inspection process. 
      - Inspection review considerations include individual work products. 
      - They may undergo multiple review types and the order may vary. 
      - They may be performed as peer reviews. 
      - The types of defects discovered vary and depends largely on the work product under review.
 
 Ad Hoc Review
  - In an Ad hoc review, reviewers are provided with little to no guidance on how a task is to be performed.
  - Often, the work product is read sequentially. And the reviewers identify and document issues as those issues are encountered. 
  - So ad hoc testing does not follow any structured method for testing. 
  - It can be randomly performed on virtually any part of the application.
  - Ad hoc reviews are very common and they're common because they require a minimum of preparation. 
  - Ad hoc testing may be performed when there's limited time to do comprehensive testing. 
  - The ad hoc review technique is very dependent on the reviewer's skills. 
  - Testers should ideally have some pretty good knowledge about the business and have a full understanding of the requirements.
  - In addition, they'll be able to find defects quite handily if they have detailed knowledge of the business process. 
  - Experienced testers tend to find more defects as they know the business better and are better at guessing where errors may occur. 
  - Because there's no formal checklist or guidance in anyway, it's quite common that reviewers report duplicate issues.
