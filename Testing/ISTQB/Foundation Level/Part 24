Inspection Review
  - The inspection review is the most formal typically of the reviews.
  - The main purpose of an inspection review is to detect potential defects
    - To evaluate the quality, and at the same time build confidence in the work product, 
    - To prevent similar defects in the future via author learning. 
    - The more that the author learns through the inspection review, the less likely that the same mistakes will be made again 
    - By getting to the root cause of the defect, you remove all possibility of that ever happening again in the future 
  - Additional objectives of an inspection review include motivating and enabling authors to improve future work products 
    - To improve the software development process overall. 
    - Another potential objective is to achieve consensus on the work product. 
    - Properties of inspection reviews include, they follow predefined processes with formal documented outputs that are based on rules 
  - An inspection review also uses clearly defined roles 
    - It may include a dedicated reader whose job is to read the work product aloud during the review meeting. 
    - Prior individual preparation for an inspection review is mandatory. 
    - Reviewers are either peers of the author or experts in some other related discipline that's relevant to the work product. 
    - Additional properties of inspection reviews include the fact that entry and exit criteria are used
    - The scribe is mandatory for the review, and not the author. It should never be the author. 
    - The review must be led by a trained facilitator.
    - The author cannot act as the review leader, the reader, or the scribe. 
    - Potential defect logs and review reports are generated and metrics are collected 
      - They are used to improve the entire overall software development process, including the inspection process. 
      - Inspection review considerations include individual work products. 
      - They may undergo multiple review types and the order may vary. 
      - They may be performed as peer reviews. 
      - The types of defects discovered vary and depends largely on the work product under review.
 
 Ad Hoc Review
  - In an Ad hoc review, reviewers are provided with little to no guidance on how a task is to be performed.
  - Often, the work product is read sequentially. And the reviewers identify and document issues as those issues are encountered. 
  - So ad hoc testing does not follow any structured method for testing. 
  - It can be randomly performed on virtually any part of the application.
  - Ad hoc reviews are very common and they're common because they require a minimum of preparation. 
  - Ad hoc testing may be performed when there's limited time to do comprehensive testing. 
  - The ad hoc review technique is very dependent on the reviewer's skills. 
  - Testers should ideally have some pretty good knowledge about the business and have a full understanding of the requirements.
  - In addition, they'll be able to find defects quite handily if they have detailed knowledge of the business process. 
  - Experienced testers tend to find more defects as they know the business better and are better at guessing where errors may occur. 
  - Because there's no formal checklist or guidance in anyway, it's quite common that reviewers report duplicate issues. 

Checklist-Based Review
  - A checklist-based review is a systematic reviewing technique. 
    - The reviewers try to detect issues based on checklists
    - They are distributed typically by a facilitator at the time when the review is initiated.
  - A review checklist consists of a set of questions that are based on potential defects, and these may be derived from experience. 
  - Checklists, in order to be effective, should be specific and aligned to the type of work product that's under review. 
  - They should be maintained on a regular basis to cover off issue types that may have been missed in previous reviews. 
  - Although the review is based on a checklist, reviewers should be careful not to just follow the checklist. 
  - Reviewers should scan for defects beyond the checklist that's distributed. 
  - The main advantage of the checklist-based technique is systematic coverage of typical defect types occurs.
  
Scenario-Based Review
  - In a scenario-based review, reviewers are given structured guidelines on how to read through the work product. 
  - A scenario-based approach allows the reviewers to perform dry runs on the work product based on its anticipated usage. 
  - This assumes that the work product is documented in a suitable format, such as by using use cases. 
  - The scenario itself provides reviewers with specific guidelines on what they should be looking for.
  - These guidelines specify defect types rather than simple checklist entries. 
  - Reviewers using scenario-based review technique should not limit themselves to the documented scenarios. 
    - By not limiting themselves to the documented scenarios, it helps to avoid missing defect types and missing features. 
    - It also helps uncover undocumented and/ or hidden defects.

Role-Based Review
  - A role-based review technique is one in which the reviewers assume the role of a particular type of stakeholder. 
  - They do this to evaluate the work product from the point of view of the stakeholder's role that they've assumed. 
  - Typical roles in a role-based review include specific end user types such as an inexperienced user etc 
    - The idea here is to assume as many stakeholder roles as possible to view the system from their perspective 
    - This helps uncover defects from each of those different perspectives. 
    - Other typical roles in a role-based review also include specific roles from the organization.
