                    ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level
                    Course Notes Part 46


The other subsections in the Incident Description section include
  - The date and time of the incident
    - You can log the date and time when the incident occurred in the Date and Time section. 
    - However, if you're using a testing tool to log incidents and defects, this information is automatically captured.
  - The procedural step
    - The developer who fixes the incident or the defect should be able to check the application 
      - And then make appropriate corrections in the software application. 
    - So the specific procedural step that caused the incident should be documented in the incident report.
  - The environment
    - You have to document the environment in which you tested the application. 
    - Environment includes hardware and software used for executing tests. 
    - For example, according to the test specifications, you have to test the application on Apple Macintosh platform 
      - So you have to specify this information in the incident report.
  - The number of attempts to repeat an incident
    - If you find an incident, you should be able to repeat it. 
    - You should also document the number of times you attempted to repeat the test. 
    - You should be able to document the exact steps that caused the incident so if somebody else tests the application, 
      - If the same incident should occur again. The developer can then deduce the problem and correct it.
  - Comments
    - As a tester and observer, you can provide general comments. 
    - For example, you can specify if a section of the application code is modified based on the incident 
     - Then all the resultant codes should also be checked for the same change. 
     - You can also specify any global issues that should be taken care of 
      - While fixing the application in the Incident Description section.
  - After providing the details in the Incident Description section
    - You can use the Impact section to describe how the incident would affect the end user. 
    - Depending on the severity of the impact, you can categorize an incident as having a low, medium, or high impact. 
    - You can also rate the incidents on a scale of one to five or ten, and based on the severity level or rating, 
      - You can then assign an order of priority to each of them.

Logging and Managing Incidents in Software Testing
Elements of incident report template
  - Logging the outcome of testing a product is as important as testing itself. 
  - This ensures that the product evolves with the desired quality through a systematic testing process. 
  - A typical test log contains incidents, the unanticipated results that you observe when executing an operation. 
    - You document incidents in an incident report.
  - One type of unanticipated result is a defect that can cause system failure 
    - By preventing the system from functioning according to its specifications. 
    - For example, online banking software may fail to execute the operation of printing the statement 
      - When the user clicks the "Print Statement" option.
  - Such failures arise due to individual defects, also called bugs. 
    - You need to prepare a test incident report, recording not only defects
      - But also any other incidents that are not as critical as bugs.
  - You use specific defect-tracking tools to record incidents, 
    - And the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Template to create a test incident report.
  - To record incidents, you can use the various elements in the IEEE Template. It includes
    - Incident report identifier
      - You assign a unique incident report identifier to your test incident report. 
      - This identifier uses a numbering scheme to track incidents and enables you to view the report of each incident.
    - Incident summary
      - You use the incident summary to relate an incident to the test case in which the incident was detected. 
      - A developer reads the incident summary and recreates the situation 
        - To run the application in an environment similar to that in which the bug was identified. 
        - You then run the test case again to ensure the developer has fixed the defects.
    - Incident description
      - The incident description provides information on incidents to the readers and enables them to replicate each incident
        - This is from a user's perspective. 
        - Usually this description comprises details such as inputs, expected results, actual results
          - Testing date and time, procedure followed, environment, the number of times the test case was run
            - And the tester's comments, if there are any.
    - Impact
      - You document the potential impact of the incident on the users under the impacts section. 
      - This information also helps you to prioritize the bug fixes. 
      - To measure the impact of defects, you use a standardized impact rating scale. 
      - For example, you use a scale with categories such as Minor, Major, and Critical. 
      - The categories must be well-defined so that the impact rating is uniform 
        - It doesn't depend on the tester who assigns the ratings.
  - From the elements you used in the incident report, the developer recognizes the root cause
    - The phase of the project in which the incident was identified, and the action that produced the incident. 
    - In addition, the incident report provides references to documents specifying the correct behavior.
