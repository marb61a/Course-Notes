                    Course Notes Part 10


Exit Criteria and Test Closure Activities
  - The objective of testing is to ensure that a quality product that meets the purpose for which it is created is released
  - Based on this objective, test plans are created and exit criteria are defined
  - Only when these exit criteria are met is testing considered to be complete.
  - Evaluating exit criteria is an important task or phase in the test process.
  - Exit criteria are a set of business-driven conditions that determine the deployment decision for a software application.
  - Exit criteria are defined during the planning phase of the test process.
    - These criteria act as a set of checkpoints
    - They provide focus on what you need to track during testing and also what you should validate test outcomes against.
  - You define exit criteria based on the critical factors of the application that need to be fully tested
  - Meaningful exit criteria that are measurable and achievable include
    - Help ensure test efficiency and effectiveness
    - Prioritize and execute testing activities
    - Evaluate current activities in the testing process and decide steps for further action
    - Suggest corrective measures for incomplete and faulty efforts
    - Identify plausible risks for your test project
  - Evaluating exit criteria lets you check whether the conditions to complete the testing process are met.
  - Evaluation requires analysis test results of a completed test suite against the objectives and the criteria set.
  - In exit criteria evaluation, you analyze different types of criteria – all of which are part of the exit criteria
  - Exit Criteria include
    - Coverage criteria help you decide test cases that must be included during the exit criteria evaluation process.
    - Acceptance criteria enable you to check whether the software under testing has passed or failed in the overall process
  - As well the exit criteria evaluation phase includes a number of tasks and activities of which 3 are important.
    - Check test logs
      - When you begin exit criteria evaluation for your test suite, you collect and check the test logs acquired
      - You check these logs against the exit criteria set for your test suite during the planning phase
      - You then identify evidence for every test executed and the defects that are logged
      - Defects are analyzed to distinguish between those that are resolved and those yet to be confirmed or fixed.
    - Estimate additional test requirements
      - Depending on the test log analysis, you can estimate if additional tests are required
      - Additional tests are required when the designed tests do not meet the required test coverage
      - You change the exit criteria only when the business or technical risks of the software under testing change
    - Prepare test summary report
      - After analyzing the test logs and assessing if more tests are required, you prepare a summary report 
      - This document communicates the test outcome to your stakeholders
      - This document summarizes testing activities and an evaluation of the test results against the exit criteria.
  - After evaluating exit criteria of the testing process, proceed to the final phase of the testing lifecycle, test closure
  - Test closure activities include
    - Test closure which is initiated by checking planned deliverables against the actual deliverables 
    - Next is collate and archive testware – test scripts, test environment components, and any tools used
    - Submitting testware to the maintenance team is an important activity of test closure.
    - Finally, you evaluate the overall process that was executed to test the software
