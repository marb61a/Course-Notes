Exit Criteria and Test Closure Activities
  - The objective of testing is to ensure that a quality product that meets the purpose for which it is created is released
  - Based on this objective, test plans are created and exit criteria are defined
  - Only when these exit criteria are met is testing considered to be complete.
  - Evaluating exit criteria is an important task or phase in the test process.
  - Exit criteria are a set of business-driven conditions that determine the deployment decision for a software application.
  - Exit criteria are defined during the planning phase of the test process.
    - These criteria act as a set of checkpoints
    - They provide focus on what you need to track during testing and also what you should validate test outcomes against.
  - You define exit criteria based on the critical factors of the application that need to be fully tested
  - Meaningful exit criteria that are measurable and achievable include
    - Help ensure test efficiency and effectiveness
    - Prioritize and execute testing activities
    - Evaluate current activities in the testing process and decide steps for further action
    - Suggest corrective measures for incomplete and faulty efforts
    - Identify plausible risks for your test project
  - Evaluating exit criteria lets you check whether the conditions to complete the testing process are met.
  - Evaluation requires analysis test results of a completed test suite against the objectives and the criteria set.
  - In exit criteria evaluation, you analyze different types of criteria â€“ all of which are part of the exit criteria
