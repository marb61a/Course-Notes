Maintenance Software Testing
  - There is a need to perform testing at every stage in the product development life cycle
  - You have to carry out functional and non-functional testing in the initial stages of the development
    - It is then followed up with structural, confirmation, and regression testing in the later stages.
  - The type of retesting when you test a system, which is in operation in a live environment, is called maintenance testing. 
  - Maintenance testing not only tests the changes to the operational system, but also the impact of this modified system 
  - The main reasons for using maintenance testing include
    - Modifications
      - Modifications refer to any enhancements and emergency corrections made to an operational system. 
      - They also include environment changes for rectifying any vulnerabilities. 
      - Maintenance testing for modifications involves verifying that these changes do not adversely affect the system.
    - Migrations
      - Migrations refer to a transfer of a system from one platform to another. 
      - Maintenance testing for migrations involve operational testing of the new environment and the modified software. 
    - Retirement of the system
      - Maintenance testing for the retirement of a system refers to testing of data migration. 
      - Or, if data is to be retained for long periods, archiving is considered.
  - Of the main reasons for maintenance testing, modifications are the ones most frequently occurring in organizations, 
  - It is therefore very important. From the view point of testing, modifications can be classified into
    - Planned modifications
      - Planned modifications account for around 90% of the maintenance work. 
      - They are structured modifications and are decided well in advance.
      - Planned modifications include three types of modifications. 
      - Perfective modifications refer to changes such as including additional features or enhancing system performance
      - Adaptive modifications refer to changes such as the product being retired or migrated to a new platform 
      - Corrective planned modifications refer to changes such as deferred defects being finally corrected.
    - Unplanned modifications
      - Unplanned modifications occur when defects arise suddenly and the malfunctions require an immediate solution. 
  - During maintenance testing, two fundamental tests are carried out to ensure the quality of the product:
    - Confirmation tests – Verifies that changed software is functioning correctly after the changes have been carried out
    - Regression tests – Checks that unchanged software is continuing to work as expected following changes carried 
  - Ideally, maintenance testing should test all the changes made to the system and the working of the entire system itself. 
    - However, this may not always be cost effective or even possible. 
    - To reduce the amount of regression testing, always first determine the parts of the system that could be affected 
    - Analyzing this impact of the changes on the system is called impact analysis.
  - Maintenance testing often makes use of original test specifications with some updates applied. 
    - An impact analysis helps in assessing the amount of updating required to the original test specifications.
  - It may be difficult to conduct an impact analysis for a system which has already been released. 
  - Impact analysis enables you to focus your regression test activities where they are most needed.  The process involves:
    - Performing a risk analysis
      - The function of a risk analysis is to establish which of the areas of a software product constitute the greatest risk
      - When time in unavailable to repeat every test, perform risk analysis determines which areas to focus on during testing
  - There are some specific differences between maintenance and regular testing for new products. 
  - The differences are due to factors, such as
    - Test types
      - Maintenance testing can include all test types that a new product undergoes
        - Often only a subset of test types is required.  
        - Maintenance testing is also different from maintainability testing, 
        - It also tests how quickly a system can be modified to meet new requirements
    - Test triggers
      - While testing for new products is carried out as part of a project, 
      - Maintenance testing is carried out as an activity in a regular organization
      - It is only when there are modifications to the system, or migration, or retirement activities.
      - This makes maintenance testing more prone to challenges such as resource availability, 
    - Issues faced
      - When systems are maintained for a while, a number of defects come to light. 
      - Specifications are needed, but unlike in the testing for a new product, they are often unavailable.
  - Also whenever there is an extension or addition, specifications have to be created. 
  - For this you can use documentation similar to the original product specifications. 
    - But this poses a problem too as you may end up having many test cases executing the same scenario. 
    - And because no traceability exists, if an incident is found, it is difficult to trace it back to the actual defect.
  - From a test management perspective, a somewhat different path is followed for maintenance testing 
  - If test specifications are not available, and if it is impossible to compile them again, 
    - Use an alternative test basis such as a test oracle. 
    - The test oracle contains information that is used to determine expected results to compare with the actual results 
    - The oracle may be anything from the current system in use to a tester's knowledge, as long as it is not code.
