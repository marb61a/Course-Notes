Perspective-Based Review
  - In a perspective-based review or reading, it's very similar to a role-based review. 
  - So reviewers assume the viewpoint of specific stakeholders in the process of individual reviewing.
  - In a perspective-based review checklists are typically used. 
    - Perspective-based reading requires that the reviewers use the work product under review to generate the product they would normally
  - Empirical studies have shown that perspective-based reading is the most effective general technique for reviewing requirements 
    - A key success factor is including and weighing different stakeholder viewpoints appropriately based on risk.

Factors For a Successful Review
  - In order to have successful reviews, we need to make sure that the suitable type of review, as well as, the appropriate techniques 
  - Also there are a number of other factors that affect the outcome of reviews
  - These factors are related to organization and people-related factors
  - First, Organizational Success Factors.
    - There is a need to make sure that each review has clear objectives defined during review planning
    - These are to be used as measurable exit criteria. 
    - Next, we need to ensure the suitable review types are applied in order to achieve the objectives. 
    - We also need to make sure that we use proper review techniques. 
    - Ensure that any checklists used to address main risks are up to date. 
    - Additional organizational success factors include reviews should be performed in small chunks. 
    - We need to ensure that adequate notice is provided and that management supports the review process. 
  - People-related success factors include choosing the right people for review objectives. 
    - Testers should be considered as valued reviewers.
    - They contribute to the review and learn about the work product. 
    - This enables them to prepare more effective tests, and to prepare those tests much earlier. 
    - We should ensure that participants are committed, and that they have dedicated or committed adequate time
    - Ensure that defects that are found are acknowledged and that they are appreciated and handled objectively. 
    - Other people-related success factors include ensuring that review meetings are well-managed, 
    - The review is conducted in a trusting atmosphere. 
    - We want participants to pay attention to body language so that they don't exhibit exasperation or boredom. 
    - We have to ensure that adequate training is provided, of course, especially for the more formal review types.
    - Ensure that there's a culture of learning, and process improvement promoted.


Testing Techniques
Choosing a Testing Technique
  - The purpose of a test technique is to help identify test conditions, test cases, and test data. 
    - It's an organized, structured way to go about identifying those items. 
  - The choice of which test technique to use, depends on several factors.
  - Influencing factors include the tester's knowledge and skills 
    - The documentation that's available, test objectives, the component, or system under test. 
    - The documented requirements is also an influential factor, as are risks associated with the product and project.
  - Additional influencing factors include the expected types of defects. 
    - Prior testing experience, which goes hand in hand with the tester's knowledge and skills. 
    - Another influencing factor is the expected use of the product, the tools available for testing
    - Time and budget is going to have a tremendous impact on the test technique chosen. 
    - As is the software development lifecycle model that's being used.
  - When using test techniques, some techniques are applicable to certain situations or levels only
    - Often it is found in practice is that you use a combination of techniques. 
    - This helps to achieve the overall best testing results based on the test effort put forth.
  - The formality level of test techniques can range from very informal to very formal. 
    - It really refers to the documentation that's involved for the various test activities including 
      - Test analysis, test design, and test implementation. 
      - The appropriate level of formality depends on the context of testing including 
        - The majority of test and development processes in the organization.
  - There may be time constraints involved, safety or regulatory compliance requirements. 
    - The knowledge and skills of the people involved and the software development lifecycle model being followed.  
 
 Black-Box Test Techniques
  - Black-Box testing techniques are also called behavioral or behavior-based techniques. 
    - These techniques are applicable to both functional and non-functional testing. 
    - Black-Box test techniques focus or concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the test object 
      - This is without reference to its internal structure.
  - Black-Box testing techniques are based on an analysis of the appropriate test basis. 
    - This means Formal requirements documents as well as Specifications. 
    - We can also take advantage of Use cases, User stories, as well as Business processes.
  - These are all part of the basis for Black-Box testing. 
    - Common characteristics of Black-Box testing techniques include 
      - The fact that the test conditions, test cases, and test data are Derived from a test basis.
    - That may include software requirements, specifications, use cases, and user stories, of course, as discussed. 
    - Test cases may also be used to Detect gaps between the requirements and the implementation of the requirements
    - The coverage metric is measured based on the items tested in the test basis and the technique applied to the test basis.
