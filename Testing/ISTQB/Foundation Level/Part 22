Static Testing
  -  Static testing techniques assess code or other work products without ever executing the code that is under test.
  - There are two types
    - First, manual examination of work products and this is called a review. 
    - There's also tool-based code or work product evaluation, and this is known as static analysis
  - Static analysis is very important for safety-critical systems
  - Static analysis is also incorporated into automated build and delivery techniques, for example, Agile development
  - Almost any work product is a candidate for examination using static testing
    - It may also be applied to epics, user stories as well as acceptance criteria, raw software code
  - Reviews can be applied to any work product that those testing understand and know how to read
  - Static analysis can be applied efficiently to any work product with a formal structure
  - Static testing has several benefits
    - First, static testing enables early detection of defects.
    - Another benefit of static testing is that defects are discovered early, in the development lifecycle
      - Defects discovered early in the development lifecycle are typically less costly and easier to address.
    - Defects found in static testing and fixed right away are practically always less costly than using dynamic testing
    - Additional benefits of static testing include the fact that defects are found and fixed typically far more efficiently.
    - Some defects are just harder to find with dynamic testing. 
    - Static testing prevents defects in design or coding
    - Static testing reduces development time and cost, and increases development productivity
    - Static testing also improves communication between team members 
  - In a requirements review, we want to ensure that requirements adhere to quality standards
  - Every requirement should be atomic 
    - This means is that you shouldn't be able to take a requirement and separate it out into multiple requirements
    - Each requirement must be uniquely identified
    - Each requirement must be complete and unambiguous
  - Static testing and dynamic testing may have the same objectives.
  - Static testing and dynamic testing complement each other by finding different types of defects.
  - One of the main distinctions between the two is that static testing finds defects in work products directly
    - This is rather than identifying failures caused by defects when the product or software is run as is the case with dynamic testing
  - Static testing may be used to improve the overall consistency and internal quality of products 
    - Dynamic testing typically focuses on externally visible behavior.
  - Security vulnerabilities may be easier to find and repair using static testing
    - Gaps or inaccurate test basis traceability, and most types of maintainability defects are only detectable using static testing
  - Within the review process, reviews can vary from informal to formal
  - Informal reviews do not follow a defined process during the review
    - There is no formal documented output generated.
  - Formal reviews, on the other hand, are characterized by having teams participate
    - There are documented results as well as procedures for conducting the review
  - Factors affecting the review process, that is, the formality of a review process include
    - The software development lifecycle model
    - The maturity of the development process, the complexity of the work product to be reviewed. 
    - Are there any legal or regulatory requirements? Or perhaps there's a need for an audit trail.
  - The focus depends on the agreed objective
  - The review process is comprised of some main activities. 
    - First, planning, in planning, the scope is defined. 
      - This includes the purpose of the review, what documents or parts of documents are going to be reviewed
        - well as the quality characteristics that are going to be evaluated. 
      - During planning, we identify the review characteristics. 
        - This includes characteristics like review type, with roles, activities, and checklists.
      - We also estimate time and effort during planning. 
      - Identify the team members and allocate roles to them. 
      - Define entry and exit criteria, and that's particularly more for the formal review types like inspections. 
      - Check that entry criteria have been met. 
    - Another activity is to initiate the review. 
      -  Also during the initiation, the scope is explained.
    - The next activity, issue communication and analysis. 
      - This is where identified potential defects are communicated. 
      - This is typically done in a review meeting. 
      - Potential defects are also analyzed. 
      - We assign ownership and status to them. 
      - We evaluate and document the quality of the work product and evaluate the review findings against exit criteria.
      - This makes it possible to make a review decision, 
      - Whether to reject, maybe there's major changes needed or maybe we can simply accept and possibly, accept with minor changes. 
      - And within the work product review process, 
    - One more activity is fixing and reporting. 
      - In this activity, the review results may vary depending on review type and formality.
      - Typical activities in fixing and reporting include generating defect reports
      - Communicating defects to the appropriate stakeholders or parties in the organization. 
      - Fixing the defects that are discovered, recording updated status of defects. 
      - Collecting metrics and this is more for formal review types. 
      - Checking that exit criteria are met, and accepting the work product.
