Formal Review Roles
  -  A formal review typically contains these roles, an author, management, facilitator, review leader, reviewers, and scribe
    - The author is the one that creates the work product under review and also fixes defects found in the work product. 
    - Management is responsible for planning the review. 
      - Management also is responsible for setting the budget for reviews.
      - Management assigns staff and allocates budget and time for staff, monitors cost-effectiveness and makes control decisions, 
    - The facilitator, or moderator, ensures that review meetings are effective and mediates when required
      - The facilitator is typically the individual that is key to the success of the review.
    - The review leader assumes overall responsibility for the review and also decides who is involved 
      - They organise the when and where the review will take place. 
      - Reviewers may be subject matter experts, stakeholders, people with technical or business backgrounds etc  
      - Reviewers identify potential defects. And reviewers may be chosen with different perspectives, 
    - The scribe, also known as recorder, collects potential defects discovered during individual review activities. 
      - The scribe records new potential defects, open points, and decisions or discussions from review meetings. 
      - Depending on the review type, one person may assume more than one role and the actions related to each role may also vary
      - Tools that support the review process may preclude the requirement or need for a scribe. 
 
 Informal Review
  - Review types range from a low level of formality to a high level of formality
    - From informal, to walkthrough, to technical review, to inspection. 
    - Reviews can be used for various purposes and are classified by various attributes. 
    - One main objective of reviews is to find defects.
  - All review types can help detect defects. 
  - Review type selection depends on several factors
    - Including the needs of the project, product type and risks, and business domain, available resources, as well as company culture. 
  - An informal review is the lowest level of formality, as suggested by the name informal. 
    - Informal reviews include the buddy check, pairing, as well as the pair review. 
      - This is where individuals either pair off together or buddy check each other's work. 
      - In an informal review, the main objective is detecting potential defects.
      - There are additional purposes however, such as generating new ideas and solutions, 
      - The informal review is not based on any formal documented process. 
      - Informal reviews may not include holding a review meeting. Although they can have review meetings. 
        - They may be performed by an author's colleague, that's the buddy check, or other team members. 
        - The results may be documented, the absolute usefulness of an informal review varies and depends on the reviewers. 
        - The informal review is very common in the Agile development model. 
        - With informal review, the use of checklists is optional.

Walkthrough Review
  - The walkthrough review is an informal walkthrough of work products. 
  - The main objectives are to locate defects, 
    - Improve the quality of the product, evaluate compliance to standards
    - Evaluate conformance to specifications, and to consider alternative implementations. 
    - Additional objectives of a walkthrough review include holding reviews to exchange ideas about techniques
  - Walkthrough reviews can also be held to train participants or to achieve consensus with respect to a work product or a review.
  - Properties of walkthrough reviews include the fact that individual preparation before actual review meetings is optional. 
    - The review meeting is generally led by the author of the work product. 
    - The presence of a scribe during the review meeting is typically mandatory. 
    - Additional properties of the walkthrough review include the fact that checklists are optional.
  - Potential defect logs may also be generated during a walkthrough review. 
    - Review reports may be produced. And the process may vary. 
    - In fact, it may take the form of a scenario, a dry run, or even a simulation. 
    - The level of formality in a walkthrough review may vary significantly
      - All the way from an informal walkthrough review to a formal walkthrough review.
        
Technical Review
  - The technical review is a little bit more formal than a walkthrough and more formal than an informal review
  - The main purposes for a technical review are to gain consensus on the product and to detect potential defects
    - Other possible objectives of a technical review include checking quality and building confidence in the work product
    - Generating new ideas about the work product or the technology
    - Motivating authors to improve future work, 
    - Enabling authors to improve future work. 
    - Consider alternative implementations of technology. 
    - Properties of technical reviews include, the fact that reviewers should be author's technical peers.
    - This means that they should be technical experts on the same level of expertise as the author. 
  - In a technical review, review meetings are optional and if they're held, preferably they're led by a trained facilitator 
    - Typically meetings are not led by the author. 
    - Individual preparation occurs prior to the review meeting. 
    - Additional properties of technical reviews include the fact that a scribe is mandatory 
    - If a review meeting is held, preferably the scribe is not the author. 
    - The use of checklists in a technical review is optional and potential defect logs and review reports are typically generated
