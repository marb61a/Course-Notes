                    Course Notes Part 15


CTFL: Test Process Fundamentals
    - Test Execution
      - Key activities include
        - Accurate recording of ID's and versions
        - Test execution which may use test execution tools
        - Comparing actual results with expected results
        - Analysing any anomalies that occur
        - Reporting of defects
        - This will be repeated as required
    - Test Completion
      - Collecting test data to assemble information
      - This occurs at milestones
      - Key activities include
        - Ensuring that defect reports are closed
        - Test summary report generated
        - Test environment finalised and archived
        - Hand testware over to maintenance
        - Analysis of lessons learned
    - Each Phase is comprised of other activities
    - Each activity can have multiple tasks
    - They are typically implemented iteratively
    - Test Work products are generated as part of the test process
    - There is significant variation from organisation to organisation
      - Type of work products generated
      - How they are managed and organised
      - How the work products are named
    - Test Work Products
      - Typically include one or more test plans
      - This includes information regarding the test basis
    - Test implementation work products include
      - Test procedure creation and implementation
      - Test suites and execution schedule
      - Once implementation is complete acievement of coverage criteria can be confirmed through bi-directional traceability
      - In some situations products can be created using tools
      - Refinement of tests defined in the plan can occur
    - Test Execution Work products include
      - Documentation regarding the status of test cases and test procedures
      - Defect reports
      - Documentation concerning test items such as objects, tools etc
    - Test Completion Work products include
      - Test summary reports
      - Action items for improvement
      - Change request or product backlog items
      - Finalised testware
