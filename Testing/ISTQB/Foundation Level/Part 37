                    ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level
                    Course Notes Part 37


Additional tasks of a test leader include
  - Planning and implementing automation
    - Test leaders decide the activities that need to be automated, and the degree and method used for automation. 
    - They also ensure that automation is implemented according to the plan.
    - Suppose you want to implement partial automation for testing a software product. 
    - To do this, you identify the specific modules of the software that need to undergo automated testing 
      - Then also assign appropriate strategies.
  - Preparing test schedules
    - The test leader prepares a schedule for all testing-related activities. 
    - This helps track the activities and ensure completion of testing on time. 
    - The schedule includes the details of the test analysis and design tasks, test implementation, execution, and evaluation.
    - For example, the test leader would draw up a test schedule with planned start and end dates for each of the test activities 
  - Assisting other project activities
    - The test leader sometimes provides testing perspective to other project activities, such as integration, planning, and scheduling.
    - Suppose unforeseen delays have occurred during the development phase of the project 
      - And you suspect that this would affect the testing schedule. 
      As a test leader, you would then need to discuss the development schedule with the project manager
       - This is to ensure that the testing activities are executed seamlessly.
  - Measuring test progress
    - The test leader compares actual test progress with planned progress. 
    - If there are any changes or deviations, the test leader takes appropriate action to meet the objectives of the project.
    - For example, after one module of testing is complete, the test leader can estimate the overall progress of the process
      - If the overall progress of testing activities is not at the planned level
        - The test leader could then employ additional testers to complete the required testing activity on time.
  - Preparing test summary reports
    - During the closing stages of the project, the test leader prepares the test summary reports 
      - These are based on the information gathered during testing. 
      - This helps in making informed decisions about the software. 
      - The outcome of the test should be known not only to the testers but also to the stakeholders.
  - The test summary report could include the number of testers deployed to complete testing
    - The total number of hours spent, and the number of defects detected in the application.
  - In addition to the test leader role, the other common test role is that of a tester. 
    - Some of the basic qualifications that a tester must have include the ability to communicate effectively 
      - Prepare and present reports efficiently.
  - In addition to the basic qualifications for testing, testers should also acquire skills in other areas.
    - Application
      - Testers should be aware of the specifications, benefits, and limitations of the application being tested
        - As well as the technology on which the application is built. 
        - This helps in identifying the functions and features that are prone to defects.
  - Technology
    - A tester must be able to determine the important functions and features of the system that is tested
      - Its intended behavior, the issues that it resolves, and the process that it automates.
  - Testing
    - Being accountable for the test execution, testers should be experts at all  test processes and techniques used to test
    - The type and the level of skill required in each area depends on the project, application, and risks involved. 
    - Because a variety of testing tasks exist, the knowledge and skills required for performing these tasks are varied. 
    - You can often find people performing specialized tasks. 
      - For example, database experts perform database testing, while security experts test security-related applications

The tasks of a tester include
  - Creating test plans and test designs
Developing and reviewing test plans are the prime tasks of a tester. The test plan provides an outline of the testing process. Additionally, the tester identifies test conditions and creates test designs, test cases, test procedure specifications, and test data.

For example, in an auction web page that you want to test, you want users to be able to view automobiles and place bids on the web site. You can set these requirements as test conditions, to check if the web page functions as expected to display the selected automobile.
analyzing test specifications
The tester needs to analyze, review, and assess the specifications of the applications, such as user requirements, design specifications, and test models.

For example, to test a messenger service application, you would need to analyze the user profile and the specifications of the application, such as its look and feel, updated functionality, and compliance with other applications.
setting up the test environment
Setting up the test environment or coordinating with the system administration and network management to set up the environment is another important task.

In some organizations, this task is controlled centrally. In these cases, a tester coordinates with the environment management for timely delivery of the test environment.
implementing tests
Testers implement test suites for all test levels of a test environment. These test levels may not necessarily fall under the direct control of the test group.

For example, testers may have to implement unit tests that were designed by programmers. This would help them approach the software test from the perspective of the developer, potentially providing them with an improved level of understanding of the application and its development.
Testers also perform tasks such as

reviewing tests
The tester executes and logs the tests, evaluates the results, and documents the deviations from expected results as defects.

For example, suppose the exit criteria that emphasize secure transactions are set for a payroll application. If these criteria are not completely met during the test process, the tester would identify the criteria mismatch from the actual results and then log them as defects.
using testing tools
The tester uses the test administration or management tools and test monitoring tools whenever required.

As a tester, you would need to use specific defect-logging applications that enable you to record defects and assign them to developers. A working knowledge of the application helps you perform the test activities effectively.
automating tests
The tester automates tests or works with developers or other appropriate technology experts to do so.

When you test the applications that have been built on recently updated technologies, you might need help from experts in that technology. This aids in understanding the system under test and also helps avoid logging invalid defects due to a lack of understanding of the updated technology.
measuring performance
The tester executes tests and measures the performance of components and systems if required.

For example, tests implemented for research purposes may require you to measure and monitor the performance of the test components.
performing peer review
The tester reviews other testers' work, such as test specifications, defect reports, and test results.

For example, a functionality tester may check if the defect report prepared by another functionality tester working on the same project is appropriate or requires modification.
