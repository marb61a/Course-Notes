                      Notes from the official syllabus
                      Part 1


The Fundamentals of Agile Software Development
  - A tester on an Agile project will work differently than one working on a traditional project. 
  - Testers must understand the values and principles that underpin Agile projects
    - Testers are an integral part of a whole-team approach together with developers and business representatives. 
  - The members in an Agile project communicate with each other early and frequently
    - This helps with removing defects early and developing a quality product

Agile Software Development and the Agile Manifesto
  - In 2001, a group of individuals who represented the most widely used lightweight development methodologies
    - Agreed on a common set of values and principles which became known as the Agile Manifesto [Agilemanifesto]. 
    - The Agile Manifesto contains four statements of values:
      - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
      - Working software over comprehensive documentation
      - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
      - Responding to change over following a plan
  - The Agile Manifesto argues that the right side concepts have value, those on the left have greater value.
