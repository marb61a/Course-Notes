                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 9


The Role of a Tester in Sprints
  - The first role is Teamwork
    - Cross-functional teams
    - Teams should be empowered
    - Team members should be co-located
    - Team efforts should be collaborative
    - Team members should be committed
    - Testers should be transparent
    - Testing team members and efforts should be credible
    - Testers should be open to feedback
    - Testers and teams will need to be resilient
  - Sprint 0 (Zero)
    - In Sprint zero of the project the tester collaborates with other team members on the following activities
      - Identifying the project scope
      - Specifying the definition of done
      - Creating the taskboard and project dashboard
      - Identify, procure and setup tools for test management
        - Also defect management, automation and other testing activities
      - Define test metrics
      - Define what are the criteria to both begin and exit testing
      - Undertake the analysis of risks to quality
    - Integration
      - Agile projects require continuously delivering value to customers
      - The tester defines the integration strategy in order to identify all dependencies
        - These are between underlying functions and features
      - The Integration strategy helps in continuous testing and delivering the customer value needed
    - Test Planning
      - This is where test scope is defined and agreed
      - Also defined is the extent of testing and both the test and Sprint goals
      - The Test environment details including tool requirements and data are defined
      - A commencement date for testing
      - The Test methods, tecniques and tools to be used
      - Defined risks and dependencies
      - Both the project and product risks are defined
      - Tasks will assigned priority levels
    - Agile Testing Practices
      - In Agile testing there are other testing practices used
      - Pairing
        - Testers sit together with other team members at one workstation to perform tasks
        - Pairing with other testers in order to test complex functionality
        - Testers will pair with developers to test automation scripts
        - Pairing with other testers can help develop skills through cross training
      - Incremental Test Design
        - Test cases are gradually built from User Stories
        - Testers should begin with simple tests and move towards more complex tests
      - Mind Mapping
        - This is a graphical representation of a concept or an idea
        - Testers are recommended to use mind mapping tools to record discussions
        - Mind mapping techniques can be used in several areas
          - Requirements Analysis, Test Design, Test Planning and measuring test coverage
        - Some benefits of using mind mapping are
          - Better test planning
          - Improved traceability of tests
          - Better monitoring of tests.



                    Section 9: Assessing Quality Risks and Estimating Test Effort
Assessing Quality Risks in Agile Projects
  - Risk is defined as any factor that creates a negative outcomes
  - The level of risk is identified by the likelihood of occurrence and the impact if it occurs
  - If a risk impacts project success it is a project risk
  - If a risk impacts product quality it is a product risk
  - The typical objectives of testing are to reduce product or quality risk to an unacceptable risk
  - In Agile projects, quality risk analysis is done in 2 places
    - Release planning and Iteration Planning
  - Quality Risk Examples
    - A slow application response to a user
    - Incorrect calculation in a shopping cart
    - System crashes after a certain amount of time
    - How does a system recover from software of hardware failure
    - The software does not work correctly on all platforms
    - A web application will not load properly on all supported browsers
