                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 6


                   Section 5: Status of Testing in Agile Projects
Benefits of Pairing
  - Increased quality
  - Knowledge Sharing
  - Capability Uplift
  - Reduced risk of loss of expertise and capability

Project Work Products
  - Agile approach
    - Lightweight documentation
    - Document only those things important important to the customer
  - Non-Agile approach
    - Excessive documentation
    - Document almost everything related to the project in detail
  - Agile project work product categories
    - Business orientated work products -- User Stories and Epics
    - Development work products -- Auyomated Unit Tests and other technical documents
    - Test Work Products -- Test Strategy, Plan, Manual and Automated tests and Test Results

Test Levels
  - Agile Approach
    - Test levels overlap
      - Requirement specification, design and development often overlap with test levels
  - Traditional Approach
    - Exit criteria becomes the entry criteria of the next level
  - Agile Test Levels
    - Unit Tests -- Typically done by developers
    - Feature Acceptance Testing -- Verification and Validation testing
    - Regression Testing -- Done through the sprint or iteration
    - System Testing
      - Done once the user story is ready for testing, both functional and non-functional testing is performed
    - Acceptance Testing
      - Usually done by the time the iteration finishes
      - Occasionally may be performed after the finish of the iteration

Testing and Configuration Management
  - Agile Approach
    - Massive focus on automation
    - Continuous Integration is heavily utilised
      - This is to ensure build stability and regular releases
  - Traditional Approach
    - Not too much focus on automation
    - Releases were infrequent so continuous integration was not much of a factor
  - Configuration Management in Agile Development
    - Heavy use of automated tools to develop, test and manage sw developent
    - Tools are used for static code analysis, unit testing and code coverage
    - New code is checked-in daily
      - An automated CI server builds and runs tests
      - This is to ensure that nothing has been broken by the new code
    - The team is informed about build status with automated notifications
    - Issues identified during CI build are rectified first

Organisational Options for Independent Testing
  - This was discussed in the foundation syllabus
  - Testers being included in the development team
    - Not a good idea as objectivity can be compromised from the testers being too close to developers
  - Have a separate independent testing team to provide service during the final days of the sprint
    - Lack of familiarity with features and time pressure can impact timelines 
  - Create an independent test team and assign a tester for the project duration
    - This provides the independence and objectivity to provide testing services without timeline impact
  - Services Provided by an Independent Test Team
    - Test Automation setup and execution
    - Functional and non-functional testing
    - Creating and supporting test environments
    - Complete the testing activities that do not fit in with sprints
      - For example System Integration Testing
                   
How to Communicate Test Status, Progress and Product Quality
  - Testers use various methods to record the progress of tests
    - Test Automation results
    - Progress of tasks and stories
    - Team progress
    - Current velocity
  - Methods to communicate with the rest of the team in Agile
    - Stand up meetings -- Verbal
    - Task boards -- either Kanban or Scrum
    - Burndown charts
    - Wiki Dashboards
    - Email with wiki dashboards
    - Customer surveys

Verbal Communication
  - A stand up is a daily meeting that involves the core team
    - Product Owners, Scrum Master and the development team
  - Ad-hoc communication happens among the team due to co-location
  - Daily stand up meetings are held so that the entire team is kept informed
  - Daily stand up meetings include all members of the agile team
  - The daily stand-up agenda for each member
    - What work has been completed since the last meeting
    - Work thas has been planned to be coppleted before the next meeting
    - Any issues that are blocking
