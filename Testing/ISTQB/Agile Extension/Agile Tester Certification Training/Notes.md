                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 1


Section 1: Course Introduction
Introduction to ISTQB Agile Tester Certification Course
  - Introduction to the instructor and course
  - The course will help pass the ISTQB Agile Tester certification


Section 2: Agile Software Development Fundamentals
Agile Software Development Fundamentals
  - Agile is a lightweight software development methodology
  - Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
  - Teams are cross functional
  - There is a focus on continuous improvement
  - Agile encouraged rapid response to change

Agile Manifesto Statement of Values
  - The Agile Manifesto is a common set of values and principles
  - It contains 4 statements of values
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan

Agile Manifesto Value 1
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Communication is given more priority over tools and processes
    - Over reliance on tools and processes creates rigidity
    - The team interacts early and frequently to resolve issues quickly
    - Agile development is people centred

Agile Manifesto Value 2
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Working software is much more useful to customers
  - This provides opportunity for rapid feedback
  - Agile delivers business value much earlier
    - It has a time to market advantage over other approaches

Agile Manifesto Value 3
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Elaborating the whole requirements during initial phases is difficult
  - Requirements are much better understood with direct collaboration with the customer
  - Close collaboration tends to bring success to a project

Agile Manifesto Value 4
  - Responding to change over following a plan
  - Projects keep changing due to various factors
  - Rigid plans and processes do not help the customer
  - Development should adapt quickly to changes

Agile Manifesto Principles
  - The 12 Agile Manifesto principles
    - Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software
    - Welcome changing requirements even late in development
    - Daily collaboration between business people and the development team
    - Build projects around motivated individuals and support the team
    - Face to face conversations and collaboration
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress
    - Agile processes promote sustainable development and the team should be able to maintain a constant pace
    - Attention to technical excellence and good design ehances agility
    - Simplicity in maximising the amount of work not done is essential
    - Self organising teams produce great products
    - Retrospecivs should be conducted regularly to analyse how to be more effective
    

Whole-Team Approach
  - Quality is everyones responsibility in the team
  - The development team, business stakeholders and customers work together
  - There are co-located teams
  - Daily standup meetings
  - Enhances communication and collaboration
  - There are relatively small teams usually 3 - 9 people

Benefits of Whole-Team Approach
  - The benefits of the whole team approach are
    - Enhanced collaboration and communication within the team
    - Projects benefit with different sets of skills in the team
    - The whole team looks after quality
    - Business representatives are involved throughout the lifecycle
    - There is knowledge sharing among the team
    - The whole team takes part in analysis and estimation
      - This approach is known as the power of three approach
        - The three being Analysts, Testers and Developers

Benefits of Early and Frequent Feedback
  - Agile has short iterations and the team demonstrates working software after each iteration
  - These demonstrations helps the team get early and frequent feedback from customers and stakeholders
  - Some of these benefits are
    - Avoids requirements misunderstanding
    - Software is available early to customers
    - The team knows what the business priorities are
    - Quality issues are resolved early in the process
    - Helps better team management
    - Promotes consistent project velocity



                    Section 3: Agile Approaches 
Agile Software Development Approaches
  - There are several different Agile development approaches
  - These approcahes implement the Agile Manifesto in different ways
  - For the ISTQB Agile certification 3 approaches will be considered
    - Extreme Programming
    - SCRUM
    - Kanban

Extreme Programming (XP)
  - This is a software developement approach intended to accomodate requirement changes and improve quality
  - It was first introduced by Kent Beck
  - It advocates frequent releases
  - There are short development cycles
  - Pair Programming is advocated
  - There are extensive code reviews and unit testing
  - There is close collaboration within the team and with the customer

Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values
  - The core values of XP are
    - Communication
    - Simplicity
    - Feedback
    - Courage
    - Respect

15. Extreme Programming (XP) Primary Principles
The primary principles of XP are
  - Humanity
    - Provide a supportive working environment to the team
    - Reward your development team
  - Economics 
    - The main goal is to produce business value
  - Mutual Benefits
    - Delivered software satisfies all parties
    - Look for win-win solutions where possible
  - Self-Familiaritiees
    - Understand exising solutuins
    - Try applying them in new contexts
  - Improvement
    - There is not design or process that is perfect
    - Always make continuous efforts to improve
  - Diversity
    - Team productivity improves through diversity
    - Have people with a wide array of skills to deal with issues
  - Reflection
    - Learn needed lessons from past experiences
  - Flow
    - Break up larger tasks into smaller ones
    - Run projects in small iterations
  - Opportunity
    - Learn from failures and obstacles
    - Look out for opportunities to learn from the obstacles and failures
  - Redundancy
    - Implement automation to avoid repetitive tasks
  - Accept Failure
    - Try things even if they do not work out
    - Consider failure as a chance to learn
  - Quality
    - Always maintain high quality 
    - Quality will increase efficiency and productivity
  - Baby Steps
    - Taking a lot of small steps can be better than taking fewer large steps
    - As above, do short iterations
    - Take regular and prompt feedback
    - Improve in each iteration
  - Accepted responsibility
    - The team will take responsibility
    - This includes responsibility for task completion
