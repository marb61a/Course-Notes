                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 1


Section 1: Course Introduction
Introduction to ISTQB Agile Tester Certification Course
  - Introduction to the instructor and course
  - The course will help pass the ISTQB Agile Tester certification


Section 2: Agile Software Development Fundamentals
Agile Software Development Fundamentals
  - Agile is a lightweight software development methodology
  - Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
  - Teams are cross functional
  - There is a focus on continuous improvement
  - Agile encouraged rapid response to change

Agile Manifesto Statement of Values
  - The Agile Manifesto is a common set of values and principles
  - It contains 4 statements of values
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan

Agile Manifesto Value 1
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Communication is given more priority over tools and processes
    - Over reliance on tools and processes creates rigidity
    - The team interacts early and frequently to resolve issues quickly
    - Agile development is people centred

Agile Manifesto Value 2
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Working software is much more useful to customers
  - This provides opportunity for rapid feedback
  - Agile delivers business value much earlier
    - It has a time to market advantage over other approaches

Agile Manifesto Value 3
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Elaborating the whole requirements during initial phases is difficult
  - Requirements are much better understood with direct collaboration with the customer
  - Close collaboration tends to bring success to a project

Agile Manifesto Value 4
  - Responding to change over following a plan
  - Projects keep changing due to various factors
  - Rigid plans and processes do not help the customer
  - Development should adapt quickly to changes

Agile Manifesto Principles
  - The 12 Agile Manifesto principles
    - Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software
    - Welcome changing requirements even late in development
    - Daily collaboration between business people and the development team
    - Build projects around motivated individuals and support the team
    - Face to face conversations and collaboration
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress
    - Agile processes promote sustainable development and the team should be able to maintain a constant pace
    - Attention to technical excellence and good design ehances agility
    - Simplicity in maximising the amount of work not done is essential
    - Self organising teams produce great products
    - Retrospecivs should be conducted regularly to analyse how to be more effective
    

Whole-Team Approach
  - Quality is everyones responsibility in the team
  - The development team, business stakeholders and customers work together
  - There are co-located teams
  - Daily standup meetings
  - Enhances communication and collaboration
  - There are relatively small teams usually 3 - 9 people

Benefits of Whole-Team Approach
  - The benefits of the whole team approach are
    - Enhanced collaboration and communication within the team
    - Projects benefit with different sets of skills in the team
    - The whole team looks after quality
    - Business representatives are involved throughout the lifecycle
    - There is knowledge sharing among the team
    - The whole team takes part in analysis and estimation
      - This approach is known as the power of three approach
      - The three being Analysts, Testers and Developers

Benefits of Early and Frequent Feedback
  - Agile has short iterations and the team demonstrates working software after each iteration
  - These demonstrations helps the team get early and frequent feedback from customers and stakeholders
  - Some of these benefits are
    - Avoids requirements misunderstanding
    - Software is available early to customers
    - The team knows what the business priorities are
    - Quality issues are resolved early in the process
    - Helps better team management
    - Promotes consistent project velocity



                    Section 3: Agile Approaches 
Agile Software Development Approaches
  - There are several different Agile development approaches
  - These approcahes implement the Agile Manifesto in different ways
  - For the ISTQB Agile certification 3 approaches will be considered
    - Extreme Programming
    - SCRUM
    - Kanban

Extreme Programming (XP)
  - This is a software developement approach intended to accomodate requirement changes and improve quality
  - It was first introduced by Kent Beck
  - It advocates frequent releases
  - There are short development cycles
  - Pair Programming is advocated
  - There are extensive code reviews and unit testing
  - There is close collaboration within the team and with the customer

Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values
  - The core values of XP are
    - Communication
    - Simplicity
    - Feedback
    - Courage
    - Respect

15. Extreme Programming (XP) Primary Principles
The primary principles of XP are
  - Humanity
    - Provide a supportive working environment to the team
    - Reward your development team
  - Economics 
    - The main goal is to produce business value
  - Mutual Benefits
    - Delivered software satisfies all parties
    - Look for win-win solutions where possible
  - Self-Familiaritiees
    - Understand exising solutuins
    - Try applying them in new contexts
  - Improvement
    - There is not design or process that is perfect
    - Always make continuous efforts to improve
  - Diversity
    - Team productivity improves through diversity
    - Have people with a wide array of skills to deal with issues
  - Reflection
    - Learn needed lessons from past experiences
  - Flow
    - Break up larger tasks into smaller ones
    - Run projects in small iterations
  - Opportunity
    - Learn from failures and obstacles
    - Look out for opportunities to learn from the obstacles and failures
  - Redundancy
    - Implement automation to avoid repetitive tasks
  - Accept Failure
    - Try things even if they do not work out
    - Consider failure as a chance to learn
  - Quality
    - Always maintain high quality 
    - Quality will increase efficiency and productivity
  - Baby Steps
    - Taking a lot of small steps can be better than taking fewer large steps
    - As above, do short iterations
    - Take regular and prompt feedback
    - Improve in each iteration
  - Accepted responsibility
    - The team will take responsibility
    - This includes responsibility for task completion

Extreme Programming (XP) Primary Practices
  - There are 13 primary practices in XP
  - Sit Together
    - Teams should be co-located
    - Collaboration and communication is more effective if teams are co-located
  - 10 Minute Build
    - Create a build and run automated tests in 10 minutes or less
    - Automated testing and building reduces costs and efforts
  - Whole Team
    - Bring together all skills and perspectives necessary
    - Teamwork is proven to produce higher quality products
  - Informative Workspace
    - A workspace should have visible lists, graphs etc to show project progress
    - The team itself should have visible notices and graphs about tasks
  - Energised Work
    - Work-life balance promotes enthusiam as well as better contribution
    - The workplace should be stress free
    - There should be no overtime
  - Slack
    - Include some minor tasks that can be dropped if needed
    - Do not over-commit and under-deliver
    - Set realistic attainable targets
  - Pair Programming
    - 2 heads are better than 1
    - Keep each other task focused
    - Brainstorm and clarify ideas
    - Hold each other accountable to team standards
    - Take programming tasks in pair and alternate partners between 1 - 3 hours 
  - Stories
    - Describe requirements in the form of user stories
    - Brief statements of required capabilities that can be finished in a short time frame
  - Weekly Cycle
    - Do planning on a weekly basis
    - Review the weekly progress
    - Pick a weeks worth of stories to implement this week
  - Quarterly Cycle
    - High level planning for 3 months
    - Pick a quarter's worth of stories to implement
    - Review lessons learned and improvements implemented
    - Focus on the big picture, wher the project fits within the organisation
  - Continuous Integration
    - Integrate and test changes frequently
    - Verify the integrated code by automated build and tests
    - Regular integration detects errors quickly
  - Test-First Programming
    - Write the tests before implementing the code
    - Run the test to see it fail
    - Write the code
    - Re-run the test to see if it passes
    - If the test fails refactor until it passes
  - Incremental Design
    - Design incrementally
    - Incremental design can incorporate feedback from customers
    - Incremental design improves quality

SCRUM
  - Is an Agile Framework for managing software product development
  - It is a lightweight iterative and incremental approach to product development
  - Scrum is easy to understand but can be difficult to master
  - Scrum contains a number of instruments and practices
    - Sprint
      - SCRUM divides projects into iterations know as Sprints
      - Sprints are a fixed length usually 2 - 4 weeks for the project duration
    - Product Increment
      - Product development is done in increments
      - After each sprint, deliverable product is released
    - Product Backlog
      - This is a list of all items that need to be delivered in the sprint
      - The product owner manages and prioritises the product backlog
      - Product backlog evolves from sprint to sprint
    - Sprint Backlog
      - The highest priority items to be delivered in a Sprint are known as backlog
      - Team is responsible for delivering all items in the backlog
    - Done of Done
      - The definition of done is a checklist which defines the criteria of completion
        - For stories and Sprint
      - Definition of done can have criteria like 
        - No open defects for story, acceptance criteria met for story
    - Time-Boxing
      - SCRUM applies time-boxing to all variety activities in Sprint
      - Meetings are time-boxed eg Standup meetings which should last no more than 10 minutes
      - Sprints are time-boxed to last 2 - 4 weeks
    - Transparency
      - Development teams report work progress on a daily basis at standup meeting
      - Task boards are setup to show the team progress
      - Showcase after each sprint to demonstrate working software

SCRUM Roles
  - SCRUM defines 3 roles
    - SCRUM Master
      - Acts as a coach for the team
      - Helps remove any blockers for the team
      - Ensures SCRUM practices are followed by the team
      - Is not a team leader
    - Product Owner
      - Responsible for creating, maintaining and prioritising the backlog items
      - Represents the end user or customer
      - Sets a clear direcction for the team
      - Manages releases
      - Stakeholder management
      - Is not a team leader
    - Development Team
      - Develops and tests the product
      - Cross functional
      - A self-organising team with no team-leads
      - The team makes its own decisions
      - Ensures transparency with daily SCRUM

KANBAN
  - Is a Japanese Word meaning visual signal
  - Work is represented as a card on the kanban board
  - Members can see the state on every piece of work
  - As the work is visual on the board, issues are seen and addressed quickly.
  - Work in Progress (WIP) Limit
    - KANBAN restricts the amount of parallel tasks
    - There can be allowed only at 1 area a maximum of work tickets
    - Once the area is free then the developer pulls a task from the preceeding area
  - Lead Time
    - Lead Time is measured as soon as a work item is created
    - KANBAN is used to optimise the continuous flow of tasks which minimises lead time

Collaborative User Story Creation
  - In Agile user stories are written to capture requirements
  - They are developed using a collaborative effort from developers, analysts and testers
  - Frequent informal reviews are done to accomplish the shared vision among the team
  - Example User Story
    - User Story Format
      - As a <Role>
      - I want to <Desired activity or capability>
      - so that <Outcome or acheivement>
    - Example
      - As a Gmail user
      - I want to login into the account with a valid username and password
      - In order to check my emails
  - Card
    - A card is physical media which describes a user story
    - It identifies criticality of the story and acceptance criteria
    - It will include the expected test and development duration
  - Conversation
    - This is a conversation between the customer and the development team
    - The conversation serves to clarify what is neeeded by the customer
    - It can be either documented or verbal
    - Communication clarifies doubts and reduces ambiguity
  - Confirmation
    - Ensure that the acceptance criteria defined in the user story has been met
    - Both positive and negative tests must be used to cover these criteria
  - The INVEST Technique for story creation
    - Independent -- The story should not be dependent on any other story
    - Negotiable -- A story can be seen as an invitation to a conversation and can thus change
    - Valuable -- The story should bring value to a customer
    - Estimable -- It can be estimated
    - Small -- They should be small enough to fit into a sprint
    - Testable -- Should clearly define acceptance criteria which can be tested
  - A testers role in User Story creation
    - Ask a lot of questions to figure out any missing details
    - Identify any missing functional or non-functional items in the story
    - Testers should use mind-mapping and brainstorming techniques for creating stories
    - Confirms the acceptance criteria
    - Proposes ways to automate and test the story

Retrospectives
  - Significance
    - These are meetings to lock back on the work done in previous sprints
    - It discusses what went well, what did not go well and what needs improvement
    - It covers topics like processes, team work and tools
    - There are follow up activities to ensure that action items are addressed
  - Time and Organisation
    - They are planned at regular levels after every sprint
    - They are organised and planned by facilitators
    - The whole team takes part in the meeting
    - Other team members maybe invited
  - Success Factors for Retrospectives
    - Clear objectives and the right set of attendees invited
    - Mutual trust and respect within the team
    - Issues or problems to be discussed should be welcomed
    - It should not target any team member
    - Follow up activities are a must
