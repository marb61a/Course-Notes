                    Course Notes Part 1


Section 1: Course Introduction
Introduction to ISTQB Agile Tester Certification Course
  - Introduction to the instructor and course
  - The course will help pass the ISTQB Agile Tester certification


Section 2: Agile Software Development Fundamentals
Agile Software Development Fundamentals
  - Agile is a lightweight software development methodology
  - Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
  - Teams are cross functional
  - There is a focus on continuous improvement
  - Agile encouraged rapid response to change

Agile Manifesto Statement of Values
  - The Agile Manifesto is a common set of values and principles
  - It contains 4 statements of values
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan

Agile Manifesto Value 1
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Communication is given more priority over tools and processes
    - Over reliance on tools and processes creates rigidity
    - The team interacts early and frequently to resolve issues quickly
    - Agile development is people centred

Agile Manifesto Value 2
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Working software is much more useful to customers
  - This provides opportunity for rapid feedback
  - Agile delivers business value much earlier
    - It has a time to market advantage over other approaches

Agile Manifesto Value 3
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Elaborating the whole requirements during initial phases is difficult
  - Requirements are much better understood with direct collaboration with the customer
  - Close collaboration tends to bring success to a project

Agile Manifesto Value 4
  - Responding to change over following a plan
  - Projects keep changing due to various factors
  - Rigid plans and processes do not help the customer
  - Development should adapt quickly to changes

Agile Manifesto Principles
  - The 12 Agile Manifesto principles
    - Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software
    - Welcome changing requirements even late in development
    - Daily collaboration between business people and the development team
    - Build projects around motivated individuals and support the team
    - Face to face conversations and collaboration
    - Working software is the primary measure of progress
    - Agile processes promote sustainable development and the team should be able to maintain a constant pace
    - Attention to technical excellence and good design ehances agility
    - Simplicity in maximising the amount of work not done is essential
    - Self organising teams produce great products
    - Retrospecivs should be conducted regularly to analyse how to be more effective
    

Whole-Team Approach
  - Quality is everyones responsibility in the team
  - The development team, business stakeholders and customers work together
  - There are co-located teams
  - Daily standup meetings
  - Enhances communication and collaboration
  - There are relatively small teams usually 3 - 9 people

Benefits of Whole-Team Approach
  - The benefits of the whole team approach are
    - Enhanced collaboration and communication within the team
    - Projects benefit with different sets of skills in the team
    - The whole team looks after quality
    - Business representatives are involved throughout the lifecycle
    - There is knowledge sharing among the team
    - The whole team takes part in analysis and estimation
      - This approach is known as the power of three approach
      - The three being Analysts, Testers and Developers

Benefits of Early and Frequent Feedback
  - Agile has short iterations and the team demonstrates working software after each iteration
  - These demonstrations helps the team get early and frequent feedback from customers and stakeholders
  - Some of these benefits are
    - Avoids requirements misunderstanding
    - Software is available early to customers
    - The team knows what the business priorities are
    - Quality issues are resolved early in the process
    - Helps better team management
    - Promotes consistent project velocity



                    Section 3: Agile Approaches 
Agile Software Development Approaches
  - There are several different Agile development approaches
  - These approcahes implement the Agile Manifesto in different ways
  - For the ISTQB Agile certification 3 approaches will be considered
    - Extreme Programming
    - SCRUM
    - Kanban

Extreme Programming (XP)
  - This is a software developement approach intended to accomodate requirement changes and improve quality
  - It was first introduced by Kent Beck
  - It advocates frequent releases
  - There are short development cycles
  - Pair Programming is advocated
  - There are extensive code reviews and unit testing
  - There is close collaboration within the team and with the customer

Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values
  - The core values of XP are
    - Communication
    - Simplicity
    - Feedback
    - Courage
    - Respect

15. Extreme Programming (XP) Primary Principles
The primary principles of XP are
  - Humanity
    - Provide a supportive working environment to the team
    - Reward your development team
  - Economics 
    - The main goal is to produce business value
  - Mutual Benefits
    - Delivered software satisfies all parties
    - Look for win-win solutions where possible
  - Self-Familiaritiees
    - Understand exising solutuins
    - Try applying them in new contexts
  - Improvement
    - There is not design or process that is perfect
    - Always make continuous efforts to improve
  - Diversity
    - Team productivity improves through diversity
    - Have people with a wide array of skills to deal with issues
  - Reflection
    - Learn needed lessons from past experiences
  - Flow
    - Break up larger tasks into smaller ones
    - Run projects in small iterations
  - Opportunity
    - Learn from failures and obstacles
    - Look out for opportunities to learn from the obstacles and failures
  - Redundancy
    - Implement automation to avoid repetitive tasks
  - Accept Failure
    - Try things even if they do not work out
    - Consider failure as a chance to learn
  - Quality
    - Always maintain high quality 
    - Quality will increase efficiency and productivity
  - Baby Steps
    - Taking a lot of small steps can be better than taking fewer large steps
    - As above, do short iterations
    - Take regular and prompt feedback
    - Improve in each iteration
  - Accepted responsibility
    - The team will take responsibility
    - This includes responsibility for task completion

Extreme Programming (XP) Primary Practices
  - There are 13 primary practices in XP
  - Sit Together
    - Teams should be co-located
    - Collaboration and communication is more effective if teams are co-located
  - 10 Minute Build
    - Create a build and run automated tests in 10 minutes or less
    - Automated testing and building reduces costs and efforts
  - Whole Team
    - Bring together all skills and perspectives necessary
    - Teamwork is proven to produce higher quality products
  - Informative Workspace
    - A workspace should have visible lists, graphs etc to show project progress
    - The team itself should have visible notices and graphs about tasks
  - Energised Work
    - Work-life balance promotes enthusiam as well as better contribution
    - The workplace should be stress free
    - There should be no overtime
  - Slack
    - Include some minor tasks that can be dropped if needed
    - Do not over-commit and under-deliver
    - Set realistic attainable targets
  - Pair Programming
    - 2 heads are better than 1
    - Keep each other task focused
    - Brainstorm and clarify ideas
    - Hold each other accountable to team standards
    - Take programming tasks in pair and alternate partners between 1 - 3 hours 
  - Stories
    - Describe requirements in the form of user stories
    - Brief statements of required capabilities that can be finished in a short time frame
  - Weekly Cycle
    - Do planning on a weekly basis
    - Review the weekly progress
    - Pick a weeks worth of stories to implement this week
  - Quarterly Cycle
    - High level planning for 3 months
    - Pick a quarter's worth of stories to implement
    - Review lessons learned and improvements implemented
    - Focus on the big picture, wher the project fits within the organisation
  - Continuous Integration
    - Integrate and test changes frequently
    - Verify the integrated code by automated build and tests
    - Regular integration detects errors quickly
  - Test-First Programming
    - Write the tests before implementing the code
    - Run the test to see it fail
    - Write the code
    - Re-run the test to see if it passes
    - If the test fails refactor until it passes
  - Incremental Design
    - Design incrementally
    - Incremental design can incorporate feedback from customers
    - Incremental design improves quality

SCRUM
  - Is an Agile Framework for managing software product development
  - It is a lightweight iterative and incremental approach to product development
  - Scrum is easy to understand but can be difficult to master
  - Scrum contains a number of instruments and practices
    - Sprint
      - SCRUM divides projects into iterations know as Sprints
      - Sprints are a fixed length usually 2 - 4 weeks for the project duration
    - Product Increment
      - Product development is done in increments
      - After each sprint, deliverable product is released
    - Product Backlog
      - This is a list of all items that need to be delivered in the sprint
      - The product owner manages and prioritises the product backlog
      - Product backlog evolves from sprint to sprint
    - Sprint Backlog
      - The highest priority items to be delivered in a Sprint are known as backlog
      - Team is responsible for delivering all items in the backlog
    - Done of Done
      - The definition of done is a checklist which defines the criteria of completion
        - For stories and Sprint
      - Definition of done can have criteria like 
        - No open defects for story, acceptance criteria met for story
    - Time-Boxing
      - SCRUM applies time-boxing to all variety activities in Sprint
      - Meetings are time-boxed eg Standup meetings which should last no more than 10 minutes
      - Sprints are time-boxed to last 2 - 4 weeks
    - Transparency
      - Development teams report work progress on a daily basis at standup meeting
      - Task boards are setup to show the team progress
      - Showcase after each sprint to demonstrate working software

SCRUM Roles
  - SCRUM defines 3 roles
    - SCRUM Master
      - Acts as a coach for the team
      - Helps remove any blockers for the team
      - Ensures SCRUM practices are followed by the team
      - Is not a team leader
    - Product Owner
      - Responsible for creating, maintaining and prioritising the backlog items
      - Represents the end user or customer
      - Sets a clear direcction for the team
      - Manages releases
      - Stakeholder management
      - Is not a team leader
    - Development Team
      - Develops and tests the product
      - Cross functional
      - A self-organising team with no team-leads
      - The team makes its own decisions
      - Ensures transparency with daily SCRUM

KANBAN
  - Is a Japanese Word meaning visual signal
  - Work is represented as a card on the kanban board
  - Members can see the state on every piece of work
  - As the work is visual on the board, issues are seen and addressed quickly.
  - Work in Progress (WIP) Limit
    - KANBAN restricts the amount of parallel tasks
    - There can be allowed only at 1 area a maximum of work tickets
    - Once the area is free then the developer pulls a task from the preceeding area
  - Lead Time
    - Lead Time is measured as soon as a work item is created
    - KANBAN is used to optimise the continuous flow of tasks which minimises lead time

Collaborative User Story Creation
  - In Agile user stories are written to capture requirements
  - They are developed using a collaborative effort from developers, analysts and testers
  - Frequent informal reviews are done to accomplish the shared vision among the team
  - Example User Story
    - User Story Format
      - As a <Role>
      - I want to <Desired activity or capability>
      - so that <Outcome or acheivement>
    - Example
      - As a Gmail user
      - I want to login into the account with a valid username and password
      - In order to check my emails
  - Card
    - A card is physical media which describes a user story
    - It identifies criticality of the story and acceptance criteria
    - It will include the expected test and development duration
  - Conversation
    - This is a conversation between the customer and the development team
    - The conversation serves to clarify what is neeeded by the customer
    - It can be either documented or verbal
    - Communication clarifies doubts and reduces ambiguity
  - Confirmation
    - Ensure that the acceptance criteria defined in the user story has been met
    - Both positive and negative tests must be used to cover these criteria
  - The INVEST Technique for story creation
    - Independent -- The story should not be dependent on any other story
    - Negotiable -- A story can be seen as an invitation to a conversation and can thus change
    - Valuable -- The story should bring value to a customer
    - Estimable -- It can be estimated
    - Small -- They should be small enough to fit into a sprint
    - Testable -- Should clearly define acceptance criteria which can be tested
  - A testers role in User Story creation
    - Ask a lot of questions to figure out any missing details
    - Identify any missing functional or non-functional items in the story
    - Testers should use mind-mapping and brainstorming techniques for creating stories
    - Confirms the acceptance criteria
    - Proposes ways to automate and test the story

Retrospectives
  - Significance
    - These are meetings to lock back on the work done in previous sprints
    - It discusses what went well, what did not go well and what needs improvement
    - It covers topics like processes, team work and tools
    - There are follow up activities to ensure that action items are addressed
  - Time and Organisation
    - They are planned at regular levels after every sprint
    - They are organised and planned by facilitators
    - The whole team takes part in the meeting
    - Other team members maybe invited
  - Success Factors for Retrospectives
    - Clear objectives and the right set of attendees invited
    - Mutual trust and respect within the team
    - Issues or problems to be discussed should be welcomed
    - It should not target any team member
    - Follow up activities are a must

Continuous Integration
  - The Continuous Integration process is as follows
    - Check-in code
      - To a central server\repository etc
    - Fetch code changes
    - Build the changed system\codebase
    - Test the changed system\codebase
    - Notify on success or failure
  - There are some automated activities in the Continuous Integration process
    - Static code analysis, compilation, Unit testing
    - Code Deployment, Integration Testing, Reporting
  - The benefits of Continuous Integration
    - Any Integration issues or defects are detected early
    - There is frequent feedback to the development team about any issues with checked-in code
    - Automated regression testing can be done continuously
    - There is more time for testers to do exploratory testing
    - There is better testing coverage
    - It eliminates risk from the Big Bang approach to Integration
    - It reduces manual testing for repetitive tasks
    - Executable software is constantly available to the test team or demonstrating to customers
  - The risks and challenges of Continuous Integration
    - The identification and implementation of the best suited tool(s)
    - Defining Continuous Integration processes
    - getting the right people with the right CI skills
    - There maybe a tendency to perform less Integration testing
    - The team may become over reliant on Automated Unit testing

Iteration Planning
  - What is Iteration Planning
    - It is concerned with the planning for each project iteration or sprint
    - It defines the iteration backlog
    - It occurs prior to the start of each project iteration or sprint
  - Activities in Iteration Planning
    - The team selects the user story from the release backlog
    - The user story is elaborated so that everyone in the team understands the details
    - There should be clarification of story details with the product owner to remove any lingering doubts
    - There is an estimation of the user story
    - The user story is broken down into tasks and these are assigned to team members for implementation
  - Testers Involvement in Iteration Planning
    - Estimate the testing efforst for stories
    - They will participate in the detailed risk analysis of stories
    - Identify both functional and non-functional aspected that need to be tested
    - Identifiaction of the story tests
    - Planning the test automation strategy at various levels of testing

Release Planning
  - What is Release Planning
    - It is concerned with product release after a certain number of iterations
    - This happens a few months prior to project commencement
    - This is where the release backlog is defined
    - High-level estimates are performed
    - Any project or product risks are captured
  - Who is involved in release planning
    - The scrum master who facilitates the meeting
    - The product owner to represent the view of the product backlog
    - The development team
    - Stakeholders who can advise around release planning
  - Activities involved in release planning
    - All the required members and the Agile team get together
    - A product backlog is created
    - User stories are given priority for the release
    - An estimation of the high level effort is done
    - The testing approach and plan is defined
  - Testers Involvement in release planning
    - Estimating testing efforts
    - Planning for release testing
    - Contribute to quality risks
    - Define testable user stories
    


                   Section 4: Differences in Agile vs Traditional Development
Differences Between Testing Activities - Agile vs Traditional Development
  - https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/assets/content/F1%20-%20Traditional%20V%20Model.jpg
  - Testing activities in Agile methodology
    - The specification, design, development and testing are done in sprints
    - Testing is the responsibility of the whole team
    - The finished product after each iteration should meet the definition of done (DoD)
    - DoD's are defined for user story, test level, feature, iteration and release
    

Agile vs Non-Agile Development Approach Differences
  - Non-Agile has longer iterations
    - Business value is obtained late in the cycle
    - Most testing is done in later stages of the SDLC
    - Bug fixes are not necessarily done in upcoming development cycle
    - No pair programming concept
    - Product Quality lies with the testing team
    - Less emphasis on automation
    - Requirement changes are managed through change requests
  - Agile has shorter iterations
    - Each iteration has working code which offers business value
    - Development and testing is done in each iteration
    - Fix bug approach first
    - Pair programming approaches used
    - Quality is everyone's responsibility in the team
    - Emphasis on automation at all levels
    - Requirement changes are welcome
  

                   Section 5: Status of Testing in Agile Projects
Benefits of Pairing
  - Increased quality
  - Knowledge Sharing
  - Capability Uplift
  - Reduced risk of loss of expertise and capability

Project Work Products
  - Agile approach
    - Lightweight documentation
    - Document only those things important important to the customer
  - Non-Agile approach
    - Excessive documentation
    - Document almost everything related to the project in detail
  - Agile project work product categories
    - Business orientated work products -- User Stories and Epics
    - Development work products -- Auyomated Unit Tests and other technical documents
    - Test Work Products -- Test Strategy, Plan, Manual and Automated tests and Test Results

Test Levels
  - Agile Approach
    - Test levels overlap
      - Requirement specification, design and development often overlap with test levels
  - Traditional Approach
    - Exit criteria becomes the entry criteria of the next level
  - Agile Test Levels
    - Unit Tests -- Typically done by developers
    - Feature Acceptance Testing -- Verification and Validation testing
    - Regression Testing -- Done through the sprint or iteration
    - System Testing
      - Done once the user story is ready for testing, both functional and non-functional testing is performed
    - Acceptance Testing
      - Usually done by the time the iteration finishes
      - Occasionally may be performed after the finish of the iteration

Testing and Configuration Management
  - Agile Approach
    - Massive focus on automation
    - Continuous Integration is heavily utilised
      - This is to ensure build stability and regular releases
  - Traditional Approach
    - Not too much focus on automation
    - Releases were infrequent so continuous integration was not much of a factor
  - Configuration Management in Agile Development
    - Heavy use of automated tools to develop, test and manage sw developent
    - Tools are used for static code analysis, unit testing and code coverage
    - New code is checked-in daily
      - An automated CI server builds and runs tests
      - This is to ensure that nothing has been broken by the new code
    - The team is informed about build status with automated notifications
    - Issues identified during CI build are rectified first

Organisational Options for Independent Testing
  - This was discussed in the foundation syllabus
  - Testers being included in the development team
    - Not a good idea as objectivity can be compromised from the testers being too close to developers
  - Have a separate independent testing team to provide service during the final days of the sprint
    - Lack of familiarity with features and time pressure can impact timelines 
  - Create an independent test team and assign a tester for the project duration
    - This provides the independence and objectivity to provide testing services without timeline impact
  - Services Provided by an Independent Test Team
    - Test Automation setup and execution
    - Functional and non-functional testing
    - Creating and supporting test environments
    - Complete the testing activities that do not fit in with sprints
      - For example System Integration Testing
                   
How to Communicate Test Status, Progress and Product Quality
  - Testers use various methods to record the progress of tests
    - Test Automation results
    - Progress of tasks and stories
    - Team progress
    - Current velocity
  - Methods to communicate with the rest of the team in Agile
    - Stand up meetings -- Verbal
    - Task boards -- either Kanban or Scrum
    - Burndown charts
    - Wiki Dashboards
    - Email with wiki dashboards
    - Customer surveys

Verbal Communication
  - A stand up is a daily meeting that involves the core team
    - Product Owners, Scrum Master and the development team
  - Ad-hoc communication happens among the team due to co-location
  - Daily stand up meetings are held so that the entire team is kept informed
  - Daily stand up meetings include all members of the agile team
  - The daily stand-up agenda for each member
    - What work has been completed since the last meeting
    - Work thas has been planned to be completed before the next meeting
    - Any issues that are blocking
    
Task Boards
  - Task boards provide an instant detailed visual representation
    - This is of the work of the entire team
    - Example available at
      - http://www.xqa.com.ar/visualmanagement/wp-content/gallery/status-tags-revisited/xqa_0764.jpg

Burndown Charts
  - A burndown chart is a graphical representaion of outstanding work versus time
  - Burndown charts are a common way to track progress across releases and within iterations
  - Example is available at
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart#/media/File:SampleBurndownChart.svg

Dashboard / Wiki Dashboards
  - These are used by agile teams to communicate status to the whole team
  - Teams automatically update staus on the dashboard
    - This is then emailed to the whole team
  - Jira dashboards are very common with Agile teams

Customer Survey 
  - Surveys or Satisfaction Surverys
  - Agile teams perform customer surveys to get feedback on the product
  - This feedback is then used to drive improvement
  - Feedback also helps in key decision making tasks
  - Any metrics should not be used to reward or punish anyone on the team



                   Section 6: Managing Regression Risk in Agile Projects
How to Manage Regression Risks in Agile Projects 
  - Why does Regression Risk increase in Agile projects
    - Each iteration adds new functionality
    - There are modifications dus to business feedback
    - There is addition, modification and removal of code in each iteration
    - Due to timelines being tight all tests cannot be executed in each iteration
  - How can Regression Risk be managed
    - Revisit Regression Test suite in each iteration
    - Automated regression testing
      - The majority of regression testing should be automated
      - They should be ran against every new build
      - If the regression tests fail then the team investigates the failure prior to continuing with other activities
      - If a test failed due to a defect then this should be repaired prior to other development activities
    - In-Sprint Automation
      - In-Sprint Automation should be implemented
      - The target is to get more test coverage with Automated tesitng
      - Identify the sprint testcase which can be added to the regression test suite
    - Automated Unit Testing
      - Ensure that unit tests are automated and ran prior to each code check-in
      - Developers should ensure that the build is not broken
      - Code check-in should only be done once all unit tests are passed
    - Automated Build Verification Testing
      - Build Verification Tests should be automated and ran after each build
      - These tests ensure that critical functionalities are working prior to testers beginning testing
      - BVT tests should pass before testing can commence
      - BVT tests ensure that time is not lost testing unstable builds
    - Automated Acceptance Testing
      - Key acceptance criteria should be automated where possible
      - They should be ran after each build against the whole system
      -They provide feedback about product quality with respect to regression since the last build
    - Automating Repetitive Tasks
      - Any repetitive tasks like data staging should be automated
      - Build deployments in test environments
      - Test environment restoration to different baselines
      - Test data comparisons
    


                    Section 7: Tester Role in Agile Projects
Role of Tester in Agile Software Development Projects   
  - Agile Testers Technical Skills
    - They should have all the ISTQB Foundation skills plus
    - They should be competent in Test Automation
    - Kowledge of TDD and Acceptance TDD (ATDD)
    - White-box testing
    - Black-box testing
    - Experience based testing
  - Agile Testers Behavioural Skills
    - Good interpersonal skills
    - Self-Organised
    - Quality focused
    - Proactive
    - Solution Driven
    - Responsible 
    - Approachable
    - Quick learner
  - Role of a tester in Agile Teams
    - Implement test strategy and plan
    - Analyse and bring in the best testing tools
    - Configure and maintain test environents
    - Mentoring other team members
    - Plan testing during iterations
    - Perform in-sprint automation
    - Do test execution and report any defects
    - Active collaboration with other team members to clarify doubts and ensure coverage and test completeness
    - Active participation in retrospective meetings
    - Providing feedback on progress, test quality and coverage
    - Setup reports dashboard and wiki for stakeholder reporting
  - Test Related Organisational risks
    - Tests may become more tolerant of low quality and inefficient practices
      - This may be due to closeness with other team members
    - Keeping pace with excessive changes during sprints
    - Testers may lose objectivity due to closeness with developers
    - Improper iteration planning may overburden testers

                    Section 8: Agile Testing Methods
Test Driven Development (TDD)
  - The Test Driven Development Approach
    - Add a test prior to adding functionality in code
    - Make the test pass by adding new code
    - Refactor the code to ensure it passes a quality test
    - The TDD approach is 
      - Write a unit test
      - Make the unit test pass
      - Repeat the process
    - The benefits of the TDD Approach
      - In TDD the enitire code is covered under the test
        - Code is only added after writing tests
      - Less defects
        - The entire code is covered by tests so the final app will have less defects

Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
  - The Acceptance Test Driven Development approach
    - In ATDD both the whole development team and business stakeholders are involved
    - Firstly it is discussed with the end user
      - Then the user stories are created with those acceptance criteria
    - The developer first writes tests for those acceptance criteria
    - The developer then writes the code which makes the tests pass
    - If the test fails then there will have to be a refactor of the code until the test passes
  - Beneftits of the ATDD Approach
    - Acceptance criteria and tests are defined during story creation
    - These acceptance criteria can help testers by making testing required easier to identify
    - It helps developers write more accurate unit tests which benefits business needs
    - The ATDD approach can quickly determine if acceptance criteria have been met
    - There are less defects as the entire code is driven by acceptance criteria

Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
  - What is Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
    - It is very similar to TDD
    - Tests in BDD are written in plain English
      - This makes it easier for non-technical users
    - The tests in BDD are more user focused
      - The aim is to explain application use
    - Tests in BDD use examples to demonstrate requirements
    - The BDD approach is driven by business value
    - BDD frameworks define acceptance criteria based on the Given\Then\When format
  - Example User-story Template
    - User Story                          User Sory Example
    - As a <Type of user>                 As a RCV user
    - I want <a goal>                     I want to enroll in training
    - so that <a reason>                  so I can get certified
    
    - Scenario                            Scenario Example
    - Given some context                  Given I am on the udemy portal
    - When an event occurs                when I to try login with my username and password
    - Then ensure some outcome            Then I should be directed to the home page
  - The Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach
    - BDD begins with user stories to identify scenarios which must be fulfilled by software
    - Testers write tests that validate the behavious of a system being developed
    - A developer in the BDD environment has to implement code in oorder to endure passing tests
    - Developers will refactor code until all test cases pass

The Test Pyramid
  - This is a graphic used to demonstrate the different levels software can be tested at
    - https://www.kaizenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kaizenko-testing-pyramid.png
  - It represents having more testing at lower levels
  - Lower levels are ofte automated with API tools
  - Higher levels are ofte automated with GUI tools
  - It is only for dynamic testing
  - Based on the early testing principle
  - Defects found at later stages are dearer to fix

Testing Quadrants, Test Levels and Testing Types
  - The idea of Testing quadrants was introduced by Brian Marwick
  - It brings more clarity between test levels and appropriate test types
  - The 4 quadrants reflect the reason why we test
  - This also applies to Dynmaic rather than static testing
  - It helps to ensure that both the important
    - Test types and Test levels are included in the development lifecycle
  - Testing quadrant can face to either business or tech
  - Testing can be fully manual, fully automated or a mixture
  - Automated and Manual
    - Functional Testing
    - Story Tests
    - Prototyes
    - Simulators
  - Manual
    - Most of the testing in this quadrant is manual
    - Exploratory Testing
    - Scenarios
    - Usability Testing
    - User Acceptance Testing
    - Alpha\Beta Testing
  - Automated
    - Component Tests
    - Unit Tests
  - Tools
    - Performance Tests
    - Security Testing
    - Ility Testing
      - Maintainability
      - Scalability
      - Compatability
      - Interoperability
  - Tests can be executed from some or all of the quadrants
    - This will depend on where the project is in the Agile lifecycle
  
The Role of a Tester in Sprints
  - The first role is Teamwork
    - Cross-functional teams
    - Teams should be empowered
    - Team members should be co-located
    - Team efforts should be collaborative
    - Team members should be committed
    - Testers should be transparent
    - Testing team members and efforts should be credible
    - Testers should be open to feedback
    - Testers and teams will need to be resilient
  - Sprint 0 (Zero)
    - In Sprint zero of the project the tester collaborates with other team members on the following activities
      - Identifying the project scope
      - Specifying the definition of done
      - Creating the taskboard and project dashboard
      - Identify, procure and setup tools for test management
        - Also defect management, automation and other testing activities
      - Define test metrics
      - Define what are the criteria to both begin and exit testing
      - Undertake the analysis of risks to quality
    - Integration
      - Agile projects require continuously delivering value to customers
      - The tester defines the integration strategy in order to identify all dependencies
        - These are between underlying functions and features
      - The Integration strategy helps in continuous testing and delivering the customer value needed
    - Test Planning
      - This is where test scope is defined and agreed
      - Also defined is the extent of testing and both the test and Sprint goals
      - The Test environment details including tool requirements and data are defined
      - A commencement date for testing
      - The Test methods, tecniques and tools to be used
      - Defined risks and dependencies
      - Both the project and product risks are defined
      - Tasks will assigned priority levels
    - Agile Testing Practices
      - In Agile testing there are other testing practices used
      - Pairing
        - Testers sit together with other team members at one workstation to perform tasks
        - Pairing with other testers in order to test complex functionality
        - Testers will pair with developers to test automation scripts
        - Pairing with other testers can help develop skills through cross training
      - Incremental Test Design
        - Test cases are gradually built from User Stories
        - Testers should begin with simple tests and move towards more complex tests
      - Mind Mapping
        - This is a graphical representation of a concept or an idea
        - Testers are recommended to use mind mapping tools to record discussions
        - Mind mapping techniques can be used in several areas
          - Requirements Analysis, Test Design, Test Planning and measuring test coverage
        - Some benefits of using mind mapping are
          - Better test planning
          - Improved traceability of tests
          - Better monitoring of tests.



                    Section 9: Assessing Quality Risks and Estimating Test Effort
Assessing Quality Risks in Agile Projects
  - Risk is defined as any factor that creates a negative outcomes
  - The level of risk is identified by the likelihood of occurrence and the impact if it occurs
  - If a risk impacts project success it is a project risk
  - If a risk impacts product quality it is a product risk
  - The typical objectives of testing are to reduce product or quality risk to an unacceptable risk
  - In Agile projects, quality risk analysis is done in 2 places
    - Release planning and Iteration Planning
  - Quality Risk Examples
    - A slow application response to a user
    - Incorrect calculation in a shopping cart
    - System crashes after a certain amount of time
    - How does a system recover from software of hardware failure
    - The software does not work correctly on all platforms
    - A web application will not load properly on all supported browsers 

Estimating Testing Effort Based on Content and Risk
  - There are several planning techniques used in Agile
  - Poker planning is the most common technique used
  - There are different values which could be used
    - Planning poker cards with different values such as 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 etc
    - T-Shirts sizes which go from small to XXL
  - Poker planning is also the recommended method for planning
  - The planning poker cycle is
    - Select user story -> Discuss details -> Everyone in the team estimates -> Show Cards and -> back around
  - The Benefits of Whole team estimation
    - Discussing the story during planning clarifies doubts and open questions
    - The whole team has a common understanding of the story
    - Higher estimates show that the story is too complex and needs to be further broken down
    - It can bring together the opinions of multiple experts
    - When doing estimations a cross functional team approach is best

Applying Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
  - What is Applying Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
    - Applying Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a test first approach
    - ATDD is based on Test Driven Development (TDD)
    - Test Driven Development uses a developer oriented appraoch
      - ATDD uses a business oriented approach
    - The ATDD approach has 4 steps which flow constantly around a circular approach
      - -> Discuss ->
      - -> Distil ->
      - -> Develop ->
      - -> Demo ->

  
Testable acceptance criteria
  - Acceptance criteria are a set of statements
    - Each of these has a clear pass or fail result
  - The Microsoft definition of Acceptance criteria is as follows
    - Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user or customer or other stakeholder
  - The Google definition of Acceptance criteria is as follows
    - Pre-established standards or requirements a project or product must meet
  - There is no partial acceptance critera
    - The criteria has either been met or it has not
  - Testable vs Non-Testable Criteria
    - Testable Criteria
      - The login page should load in less than 2 seconds
      - The system should be available 24\5
      - A person in a doctor role can access patient files
    - Non-Testable Criteria
      - The login page should load quickly
      - The system should be available always
      - A user can access patient files

Exploratory Testing and Agile Testing
  - What is Exploratory Testing
    - Learn about the system as you design and test it
    - Test design and execution occur at the same time
    - It is guided by the test charter
    - Test charter provides the test condition to cover during time-boxed testing
    - The most recent results guide the next step
    - Testers use both white and black box test design techniques
  - Information included in the Test Charter
    - Actor -- Who is using the system
    - Purpose -- Test conditions or objectives
    - Setup -- Pre-conditions or setup required before starting the test
    - Priority -- The importance of this charter
    - Reference -- To the related User Stories and risks
    - Data -- The test data required to carry out testing
    - Activities -- A list of the possible scenarios to be performed by the user
    - Oracle Notes -- How to eveluate the product to determine whether it meets the expected results
    - Variations -- Alternative actions to perform to complement scenarios that are described in Activities
  - Heuristics that can be applied while testing
    - CRUD
    - Follow The Data
    - Configuration Variations
    - Constraints
    - Interruptions
    - Multi-user
  - Useful Information Than Needs to be Documented
    - Test Coverage -- Meaning how much testing is covered
    - Evaluation Notes -- Covering what are the risks and observations
    - Risk/Strategy -- What are the risks covered
    - Issues, Doubts or Anomalies -- Any findings or doubts during execution
    - Actual Behaviour -- What is the actual behaviour of the system including video, screenshots etc
  - How is Exploratory Testing Managed
    - Use a session-based Time Management Technique
      - This should be an uninterrupted period of time-boxed testing
        - This should be between 90 and 120 minutes
      - Test Sessions should include the following
        - Survey Session
        - Analysis Session
        - Deep Coverage
  - Other Testing Techniques To Be Used
    - Other testing techniques to be combined with exploratory testing
      - Analytical Strategy
      - Model Based Strategy
      - Regression Averse Strategy
      - Process or standard compliant strategy
      - Consultative strategy
