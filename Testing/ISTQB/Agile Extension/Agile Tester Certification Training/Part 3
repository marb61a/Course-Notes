                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 3


Extreme Programming (XP) Primary Practices
  - There are 13 primary practices in XP
  - Sit Together
    - Teams should be co-located
    - Collaboration and communication is more effective if teams are co-located
  - 10 Minute Build
    - Create a build and run automated tests in 10 minutes or less
    - Automated testing and building reduces costs and efforts
  - Whole Team
    - Bring together all skills and perspectives necessary
    - Teamwork is proven to produce higher quality products
  - Informative Workspace
    - A workspace should have visible lists, graphs etc to show project progress
    - The team itself should have visible notices and graphs about tasks
  - Energised Work
    - Work-life balance promotes enthusiam as well as better contribution
    - The workplace should be stress free
    - There should be no overtime
  - Slack
    - Include some minor tasks that can be dropped if needed

  - Weekly Cycle
    - Do planning on a weekly basis

    - Review lessons learned and improvements implemented
    - Focus on the big picture, wher the project fits within the organisation
  - Continuous Integration
    - Integrate and test changes frequently
    - Verify the integrated code by automated build and tests
    - Regular integration detects errors quickly
  - Test-First Programming
    - Write the tests before implementing the code
    - Run the test to see it fail
    - Write the code
    - Re-run the test to see if it passes
    - If the test fails refactor until it passes
  - Incremental Design
    - Design incrementally
    - Incremental design can incorporate feedback from customers
    - Incremental design improves quality

SCRUM
  - Is an Agile Framework for managing software product development
  - It is a lightweight iterative and incremental approach to product development
  - Scrum is easy to understand but can be difficult to master
  - Scrum contains a number of instruments and practices
    - Sprint
      - SCRUM divides projects into iterations know as Sprints
      - Sprints are a fixed length usually 2 - 4 weeks for the project duration
    - Product Increment
      - Product development is done in increments
      - After each sprint, deliverable product is released
    - Product Backlog
      - This is a list of all items that need to be delivered in the sprint
      - The product owner manages and prioritises the product backlog
      - Product backlog evolves from sprint to sprint
    - Sprint Backlog
      - The highest priority items to be delivered in a Sprint are known as backlog
      - Team is responsible for delivering all items in the backlog
    - Done of Done
      - The definition of done is a checklist which defines the criteria of completion
        - For stories and Sprint
      - Definition of done can have criteria like 
        - No open defects for story, acceptance criteria met for story
    - Time-Boxing
      - SCRUM applies time-boxing to all variety activities in Sprint
      - Meetings are time-boxed eg Standup meetings which should last no more than 10 minutes
      - Sprints are time-boxed to last 2 - 4 weeks
    - Transparency
      - Development teams report work progress on a daily basis at standup meeting
      - Task boards are setup to show the team progress
      - Showcase after each sprint to demonstrate working software
