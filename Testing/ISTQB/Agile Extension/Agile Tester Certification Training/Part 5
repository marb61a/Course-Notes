                    Course Notes Part 5


Continuous Integration
  - The Continuous Integration process is as follows
    - Check-in code
      - To a central server\repository etc
    - Fetch code changes
    - Build the changed system\codebase
    - Test the changed system\codebase
    - Notify on success or failure
  - There are some automated activities in the Continuous Integration process
    - Static code analysis, compilation, Unit testing
    - Code Deployment, Integration Testing, Reporting
  - The benefits of Continuous Integration
    - Any Integration issues or defects are detected early
    - There is frequent feedback to the development team about any issues with checked-in code
    - Automated regression testing can be done continuously
    - There is more time for testers to do exploratory testing
    - There is better testing coverage
    - It eliminates risk from the Big Bang approach to Integration
    - It reduces manual testing for repetitive tasks
    - Executable software is constantly available to the test team or demonstrating to customers
  - The risks and challenges of Continuous Integration
    - The identification and implementation of the best suited tool(s)
    - Defining Continuous Integration processes
    - getting the right people with the right CI skills
    - There maybe a tendency to perform less Integration testing
    - The team may become over reliant on Automated Unit testing

Iteration Planning
  - What is Iteration Planning
    - It is concerned with the planning for each project iteration or sprint
    - It defines the iteration backlog
    - It occurs prior to the start of each project iteration or sprint
  - Activities in Iteration Planning
    - The team selects the user story from the release backlog
    - The user story is elaborated so that everyone in the team understands the details
    - There should be clarification of story details with the product owner to remove any lingering doubts
    - There is an estimation of the user story
    - The user story is broken down into tasks and these are assigned to team members for implementation
  - Testers Involvement in Iteration Planning
    - Estimate the testing efforst for stories
    - They will participate in the detailed risk analysis of stories
    - Identify both functional and non-functional aspected that need to be tested
    - Identifiaction of the story tests
    - Planning the test automation strategy at various levels of testing
