                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 5


Continuous Integration
  - The Continuous Integration process is as follows
    - Check-in code
      - To a central server\repository etc
    - Fetch code changes
    - Build the changed system\codebase
    - Test the changed system\codebase
    - Notify on success or failure
  - There are some automated activities in the Continuous Integration process
    - Static code analysis, compilation, Unit testing
    - Code Deployment, Integration Testing, Reporting
  - The benefits of Continuous Integration
    - Any Integration issues or defects are detected early
    - There is frequent feedback to the development team about any issues with checked-in code
    - Automated regression testing can be done continuously
    - There is more time for testers to do exploratory testing
    - There is better testing coverage
    - It eliminates risk from the Big Bang approach to Integration
    - It reduces manual testing for repetitive tasks
    - Executable software is constantly available to the test team or demonstrating to customers
  - The risks and challenges of Continuous Integration
    - The identification and implementation of the best suited tool(s)
