                    Agile Tester Certification Training
                    Course Notes Part 7


Task Boards
  - Task boards provide an instant detailed visual representation
    - This is of the work of the entire team
    - Example available at
      - http://www.xqa.com.ar/visualmanagement/wp-content/gallery/status-tags-revisited/xqa_0764.jpg

Burndown Charts
  - A burndown chart is a graphical representaion of outstanding work versus time
  - Burndown charts are a common way to track progress across releases and within iterations
  - Example is available at
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart#/media/File:SampleBurndownChart.svg

Dashboard / Wiki Dashboards
  - These are used by agile teams to communicate status to the whole team
  - Teams automatically update staus on the dashboard
    - This is then emailed to the whole team
  - Jira dashboards are very common with Agile teams

Customer Survey 
  - Surveys or Satisfaction Surverys
  - Agile teams perform customer surveys to get feedback on the product
  - This feedback is then used to drive improvement
  - Feedback also helps in key decision making tasks
  - Any metrics should not be used to reward or punish anyone on the team



                   Section 6: Managing Regression Risk in Agile Projects
How to Manage Regression Risks in Agile Projects 
  - Why does Regression Risk increase in Agile projects
    - Each iteration adds new functionality
    - There are modifications dus to business feedback
    - There is addition, modification and removal of code in each iteration
    - Due to timelines being tight all tests cannot be executed in each iteration
  - How can Regression Risk be managed
    - Revisit Regression Test suite in each iteration
    - Automated regression testing
      - The majority of regression testing should be automated
      - They should be ran against every new build
      - If the regression tests fail then the team investigates the failure prior to continuing with other activities
      - If a test failed due to a defect then this should be repaired prior to other development activities
    - In-Sprint Automation
      - In-Sprint Automation should be implemented
      - The target is to get more test coverage with Automated tesitng
      - Identify the sprint testcase which can be added to the regression test suite
    - Automated Unit Testing
      - Ensure that unit tests are automated and ran prior to each code check-in
      - Developers should ensure that the build is not broken
      - Code check-in should only be done once all unit tests are passed
    - Automated Build Verification Testing
      - Build Verification Tests should be automated and ran after each build
      - These tests ensure that critical functionalities are working prior to testers beginning testing
      - BVT tests should pass before testing can commence
      - BVT tests ensure that time is not lost testing unstable builds
    - Automated Acceptance Testing
      - Key acceptance criteria should be automated where possible
      - They should be ran after each build against the whole system
      -They provide feedback about product quality with respect to regression since the last build
    - Automating Repetitive Tasks
      - Any repetitive tasks like data staging should be automated
      - Build deployments in test environments
      - Test environment restoration to different baselines
      - Test data comparisons
