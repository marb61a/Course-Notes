                    Section 8: Agile Testing Methods
Test Driven Development (TDD)
  - The Test Driven Development Approach
    - Add a test prior to adding functionality in code
    - Make the test pass by adding new code
    - Refactor the code to ensure it passes a quality test
    - The TDD approach is 
      - Write a unit test
      - Make the unit test pass
      - Repeat the process
    - The benefits of the TDD Approach
      - In TDD the enitire code is covered under the test
        - Code is only added after writing tests
      - Less defects
        - The entire code is covered by tests so the final app will have less defects

Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
  - The Acceptance Test Driven Development approach
    - In ATDD both the whole development team and business stakeholders are involved
    - Firstly it is discussed with the end user
      - Then the user stories are created with those acceptance criteria
    - The developer first writes tests for those acceptance criteria
    - The developer then writes the code which makes the tests pass
    - If the test fails then there will have to be a refactor of the code until the test passes
  - Beneftits of the ATDD Approach
