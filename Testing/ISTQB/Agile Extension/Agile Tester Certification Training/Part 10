Acceptance Criteria
  - Functional Behaviour -- Meaning what does the system do
  - Quality Characteristics -- How does the system perform the behaviou
  - Scenarios -- These are sequences of actions performed by the end user
    - They are performed in order to accomplish desired output
  - Business Rules -- These are internal rules performed against external inputs
  - External Interfaces -- Which are coonection details to integrate the developed system to external connections
  - Constraints -- These are any limitations whether timeline, technology etc
  - Data Definitions -- These describe data formats, types and allowed values
  - Other Information Relevant For Testers
    - How the system is supposed to work
    - How within the testing environment can the system be tested
    - The testing tools required
    - Both the knowledge and skills required to perform the testing

Definition of Done - Test Levels
  - Unit Testing
    - 100% test coverage is desired
    - Any unfeasible paths are reviewed and signed off by the development lead
    - All unit tests should have passed
    - All the results from unit tests are reviewed
    - Unit tests should be automated
    - Depending on the agreed criteria, there should be no major or critical outstanding defects
    - Also static code analysis should be completed
  - Integration Testing
    - All functional test cases should be executed
    - All interfaces between unit tests should be tested successfully
    - Depending on the agreed criteria, there should be no major or critical outstanding defects
    - Defects found should be reported properly in the tracking tool
    - Regression tests should be automated as per agreements
    - Any and all quality risks should be addressed
  - System Testing
    - End-to-End testing of the user story should be completed
    - All of the acceptance criteria from the user story have been met
    - Non-functional quality characteristics have been met
      - These include performance and reliability
    - All quality risks have been covered
    - All Regression tests have been performed and new ones added as needed
    - All Regression tests should be automated
      - Any unfeasible automated tests should be signed off on by proper person
    - No major or critical outstanding defects
    - Defects found should be reported properly in the defect management tool
