KANBAN
  - Is a Japanese Word meaning visual signal

    - KANBAN restricts the amount of parallel tasks
    - There can be allowed only at 1 area a maximum of work tickets
    - Once the area is free then the developer pulls a task from the preceeding area
  - Lead Time
    - Lead Time is measured as soon as a work item is created
    - KANBAN is used to optimise the continuous flow of tasks which minimises lead time

Collaborative User Story Creation
  - In Agile user stories are written to capture requirements
  - They are developed using a collaborative effort from developers, analysts and testers
  - Frequent informal reviews are done to accomplish the shared vision among the team
  - Example User Story

      - As a <Role>
      - I want to <Desired activity or capability>
      - so that <Outcome or acheivement>

      - In order to check my emails
  - Card
    - A card is physical media which describes a user story
    - It identifies criticality of the story and acceptance criteria
    - It will include the expected test and development duration
  - Conversation
    - This is a conversation between the customer and the development team
    - The conversation serves to clarify what is neeeded by the customer
    - It can be either documented or verbal
    - Communication clarifies doubts and reduces ambiguity
  - Confirmation
    - Ensure that the acceptance criteria defined in the user story has been met
    - Both positive and negative tests must be used to cover these criteria
  - The INVEST Technique for story creation
    - Independent -- The story should not be dependent on any other story
    - Negotiable -- A story can be seen as an invitation to a conversation and can thus change
    - Valuable -- The story should bring value to a customer
    - Estimable -- It can be estimated
    - Small -- They should be small enough to fit into a sprint
    - Testable -- Should clearly define acceptance criteria which can be tested
  - A testers role in User Story creation
    - Ask a lot of questions to figure out any missing details
    - Identify any missing functional or non-functional items in the story
    - Testers should use mind-mapping and brainstorming techniques for creating stories
    - Confirms the acceptance criteria
    - Proposes ways to automate and test the story
