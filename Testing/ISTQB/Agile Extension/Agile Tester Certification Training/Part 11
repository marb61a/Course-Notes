    - Pre-established standards or requirements a project or product must meet
  - There is no partial acceptance critera
    - The criteria has either been met or it has not
  - Testable vs Non-Testable Criteria

    - Non-Testable Criteria
      - The login page should load quickly
      - The system should be available always

Exploratory Testing and Agile Testing
  - What is Exploratory Testing
    - Learn about the system as you design and test it
    - Test design and execution occur at the same time
    - It is guided by the test charter
    - Test charter provides the test condition to cover during time-boxed testing
    - The most recent results guide the next step
    - Testers use both white and black box test design techniques
  - Information included in the Test Charter
    - Actor -- Who is using the system
    - Purpose -- Test conditions or objectives
    - Setup -- Pre-conditions or setup required before starting the test
    - Priority -- The importance of this charter
    - Reference -- To the related User Stories and risks
    - Data -- The test data required to carry out testing
    - Activities -- A list of the possible scenarios to be performed by the user
    - Oracle Notes -- How to eveluate the product to determine whether it meets the expected results
    - Variations -- Alternative actions to perform to complement scenarios that are described in Activities
  - Heuristics that can be applied while testing
    - CRUD
    - Follow The Data
    - Configuration Variations
    - Constraints
