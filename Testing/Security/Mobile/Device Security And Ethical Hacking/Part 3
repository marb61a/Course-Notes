                    Mobile Device Security And Ethical Hacking
                    Course Notes Part 3


5 - What You Need To Know Wearable Device
This will focus mostly on the hardware involved in wearable devices
Apple Watch
  - This is a companion product to the IPhone
  - It does not do much by itself as it has no idependent cellular access
  - It has Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Near Field Communication (NFC) and Wi-Fi
  - It is used a lot with Fitness Integration similar to FitBit etc
  - WatchOS is based on iOS
    - v1 only showed app data
    - v2 however can run native WatchOS apps using WatchKit
      - WatchKit is the primary API for apps
      - WatchOS can share data with an IPhone using BLE
  - The Watch can connect to Wi-Fi networks
    - It primarily uses BLE but connects when this is not available and it also connects during a few scenarios
    - The Watch learns about Wi-Fi networks from a handheld device rather than setting one up on the device
    - The Watch will connect to WPA/WPA2-PSK, it won't connect to WPA/WPA2 Enterprise networks
  - Watch will display a cloud in the Settings
  - Apps will have direct Internet access through Wi-Fi and also access to the phone data
    - This is a security headache as it means that data can be exfiltrated outside of an IPhone connection
  - Watch apps are full apps but are meant for limited interaction 
  - The Watch integrates with Handoff for iOS or OSX
  - Some apps are fully featured and can access network resources through tetherless WiFi or IPhone
    - Others are only notifications from companion applications on the larger platforms
  - Watch components are never distributed independently

6 - Building Your Lab
Building a lab for testing purposes
  - This section focuses mostly on Enterprise systems
  - These should not include everyday production devices
  - Lab components should include the same type of software etc used in production systems
  - 

7 - Mitigating Mobile Malware
Mobile malware is a growing threat for devices
  - There are new opportunities for exploiting users emerging all the time
  - With this there are also more opportunities for attacker financial gain
    - Related to this are things like political attacks etc
  - At this moment mobile malware is a small fraction of the overall threat
    - This is changing at a rapid pace however
  - Individual platforms have varying levels of exposure to malware
  - The growth in mobile malware is influenced by attacker opportunities
    - Many incentives for malware but not all are tied to financial benefits
    - There are some incentives which are unique to mobile
      - These include combining ease of exploitation, large numbers of targets and immediate financial gain
One of the major ways that mobile malware is used is user credential theft
  - Mobile phones are increasingly used for 2 factor authentication via SMS
    - This is used a lot in Banking and other financial activities
  - The Zitmo variant of the ZeuS trojan targets multiple mobile platforms
    - Zitmo is an acronym for Zeus In The MObile 
    - It controls SMS and phone functionality
    - Then it blocks inbound or outbound calls
    - It will then silently intercept SMS messages
  - This then works with the PC variant of ZeuS to bypass banking authentication checks
A relative straightforward method for black-hats to make money is to exploit short-code SMS
  - This is unique to mobile devices due to the near ubiquitous SMS access
  - There are premium rate services where there is a charge for each SMS received
    - End users are billed as normal by their operator
    - On the other hand attackers are paid immediately
  - There are opportunities to silently send SMS on Android which is a significant attacker motivator
Mobile Malware Delivery methods
  - Official app store repositories which rend to be very short lived
  - Third party app store which typically target Android or jailbroken & unlocked Windows phones & IPhones
    - These stores are not policed as well as official stores
  - Direct download installation from malicious websites
  - Direct victim targeting through various message formats eg email, SMS & MMS
    - This is usually an attachment or a URL
Android Malware
  - This is probably the most prevalent type of mobile malware
    - There are more specimens available than other platforms
  - The platform itself allows third party stores, untrusted applications and silent SMS delivery
    - These will increase attack vectors significantly
  - There is an ease for attackers for repackage legitimate apps with malware
  - Because of the platform fragmentation there is an increased lifetime for exploits
  - One very common way that is used for malware distribution on Android is fake installers
    - This impersonates a legitimate application but has malicious activity
    - One example of this is the use of short code SMS messages
    - This then has the behaviour of a trojan of another attack vector for malicious applications


8 - Mitigating The Stolen Device Threat
The simple fact is that devices will be misplaced
  - They will either be lost or stolen
  - High Tech devices are often a target for theft
Stole devices will introduce risk into the organisation
  - These will usually be information or system access threats will stored credentials
Organisations can manage the threat through preperation, policy and device management
