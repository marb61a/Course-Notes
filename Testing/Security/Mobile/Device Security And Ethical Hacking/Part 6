                    Mobile Device Security And Ethical Hacking
                    Course Notes Part 6



                    Section 4 - Penetration Testing Mobile Devices Part 1
1 - Mobile Penetration Testing
Mobile Penetration Tesing
  - Evaluation of the device environment for potential vulnerabilities
  - Once vulnerabilities have been discovered then the exploitation of them and unauthorised use of resources
  - Organisations will have risks and the data resources will need to be examined to quantify risks
  - Steps must be applied for each target areas under test
  - Mobile Penetration Testing means different things to different people
When talking about Mobile Penetration Tesing here it does not mean using a mobile device to do a Pen Test
  - These can be useful but more for convenience and are not recommended by the instructor
Mobile Penetration Tesing needs to be specific about what is being tested
  - This can be a difficult question to answer
  - Typically several different areas are tested
    - App Components
    - Wirelessly connected devices such as Phones & Tablets
    - Where mobile data is backed up to such as Desktops, Servers etc
    - Deployment supporting infrastructure
    - Back-end systems that support system configuration
    - Cloud Systems
    - Physically possessing a device
  - Complexity in an environment can help a Pen Tester
The Roles is a Pen Test
  - Understanding the techniques behind Mobile Penetration Tesing can be beneficial for different audience types
    - Pen Testers who are seeking to expand or update skill sets
    - There are analysts who will learn about testing secure deployments
    - Any auditors who need to determine if the auditing performed has been sufficient
  - There is also value from having non-technical people understand some material
    - For people hiring or procuring tests or testers there should be the abilty to evaluate testing
    - To determine the competency of consultants
