                    Mobile Device Security And Ethical Hacking
                    Course Notes Part 6


                    Section 2 - Mobile Platform Access And Application Access
1 - Unlocking, Rooting And Jailbreaking
This is the start of the second section of the course
All popular mobile devices come with restrictions
  - There are usually permitted application install sources
  - Local device access privileges
  - Code Signing requirements
There are common needs to be able to escape these restrictions
  - Many different users have successfully leveraged these escapes
These become unrestricted devices
There are different motivations for requiring unrestricted access to devices
  - Enterprise administrators should have at least one unrestricted device per platform
  - There is often a need for unrestricted access to the mobile OS, some reasons include
    - Application binary collection for analysis
    - Runtime analysis of software
    - Filesystem Profiling and monitoring
    - Penetration testing targets

2 - Data Storage And File Systems
There is a huge amount of sensitive material stored on mobile devices
  - Passwords for network services such as email accounts
  - Documents such as notes, bookmarks, email messages
  - SMS content such as call records, virtual keystrokes
There are other resources which may not be as obvious as some others
  - Application binaries
  - Public and private digital certificates
This section will examine extracting this data to be used when evaluating threats
  - These will come from both compromised and stolen devices
iOS Filesystem
  - It is very similar to MacOS and other *nix systems
  - The /private directory is of huge interest specifically /private/var/mobile 
  - The Media subdirectory in private will hold the various media types such as images etc
  - The MobileSoftwareUpdate subdirectory is for over the network downloads for files
  - The Downloads subdirectory is for AirDrop files
  - The Containers subdirectory should be looked at carefully as it holds some interesting material
  - The /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared directory will hold files being shared by applications
    - This is done through Share Extensions where 2 applications will get access to the shared data directory
  - The /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle directory is where the applications themselves are
    - When 3rd party applications are installed they are in the Bundle directory
    - Using ls in the /private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application directory and will show GUID's of installed apps
  - The /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data is where the data for 3rd party applications is stored
  

3 - Network Activity Analysis
There is a lab and solution
  - The lab is to find passwords on a jailbroken iOS device
  - The instructor recommends that you spend as much time as possible as you will learn a lot more about the iOS filesystem
  - This exercise is solved on the Windows platform
  - To search a directory in Windows -> dir /s
  - Having all files available in the one file can help understand what is on the filesystem
  - This can be tuned for different file types
  - This approach will help save time in the long run
  - Using the command line is not compulsory as some people may not be familiar
  - The SQLite Spy tool is used to examine the sms.db file found in the example
    - This tool will examine databases from SQLite database which is used on a lot of mobile devices
Static Application Analysis
  - This is further evaluating an app by examining the executable itself
    - There is no need to execute the file to evaluate it
  - This includes reverse-engineering the code to identify activities
  - This does not require anybody to be a programmer
    - It does however require some good analysis and research skills which will develop over time
  - It will provide more conclusive analysis and results than monitoring activities such as traffic monotoring
Legality of Reverse Engineering
  - Different jurisdictions have different laws on reverse-engineering
  - It is important to seek legal advice prior to proceeding with any reverse-engineering
  - In the US it is covered by DMCA laws
    - Reverse-engineering is permitted when seeking to understand and analyse interoperability
    - This can be to see if software such as firewalls integrates and operates with eg OS infrastructure
  - EU is covered by the Computer Programs Directive
    - This is again permitted as fair practice and does not require authorisation from holder of copyright
  - In some cases End User Legal Agreements (EULA) are deemed more important than fair use access so again check



                    Section 3 - Mobile Application Reverse Engineering
1 - Automating App Analysis
Manual analysis of apps gives the best security details, however there are costs to this
  - It is time consuming to perform an analysis
  - It require a skillset that can only be acquired over time
Automating analysis with 3rd party apps is an alternative
  - Some tools are limited but can be useful in conjunction with manual analysis
Mobile device app analysis tools are still very immature
  - They are probably only in beta level
There are no sophisticated commercial tools available
  - There are free/open source tools
  - These tools are often from enthusiasts so do not expect professional level anything
Both Android and iOS tools can be beneficial but also can be buggy and problematic
There are some times when automated app-analysis tools should be used
  - When evaluating new app requests prior to approval for internal use
    - The instructor recommends using app-analysis tools anytime there is a significant deployment of system or mobile apps
  - Penetration tests of app security
  - When performing evaluations of malware for mobile devices
  - As part of an incident response from a mobile device that has been compromised
Needle 
  - This is an iOS modular framework app assessment tool
    - It works on Linux or MacOS and interacts with a jailbroken devicce over SSH
  - It uses a console and modules like Metasploit 
    - The modules are classified as Binary, Comms, Dynamic, Hooking, Static, Storage, Various
  - You need to connect a jailbroken device with USB
  

2 - Reverse Engineering Obfuscated Applications
Reversing 3rd party app platforms
  - Xamarin
  - PhoneGap
Reverse Engineering Obfuscated Applications
  - Reverse-Engineering Android applications using Jadx is straightforward enough
    - It can be time consuming but easy enough to get to Java source code
  - Developers try to make using reverse-engineering tools on Android much more difficult
    - They use techniques such as defensive coding and app obfuscation
  - iOS is much more difficult to reverse engineer 
Reverse Engineering of non-native platforms changes
  - Behavioural analysis however stays the same
There will be a lot of code looked at in this module
  - There is a warning given to students to prepare them for this
  - There is no assumption of coding skills of students
  - Most professional developers use Stack Overflow to find answers too
    - Very rarely code is written without looking material up eg API documentation
  - Understanding coding techniques can be a very valuable skill to learn for security specialists
    - This will make you a better security analyst
Unity Framework
  - There is a need to understand 3rd party platforms and Unity is a very popular one
  - It is used to develop 2d and 3d games
    - This can be extended to develop utility apps
  - https://unity3d.com
  - Developers using Unity can code in JavaScript, C# and BOO
    - The unity engine on iOS and Android converts instructions at runtime to native
ProGuard
  - This is a very popular tool among Android developers
  - https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard
  - It is an open source bytecode optimiser for Java
  - It is included by default with the Android Studio IDE 
    - It needs to be turned on as default if turned off
Unity
  - Unity applications can be examined
  - Typically this will be the Android version of the application if on Andoid systems
    - Some files when unpacking an apk are
      - AndroidManifest.xml -- Android App delarations
      - classes.dex -- Minimal Android app to launch the Unity engine
      - lib/* -- Natively compiled libraries for the Unity engine
      - assets/bin/Data/* -- Shaders, textures and other Unity objects
      - assets/bin/Data/Managed/Assembly*.dll -- Unity app binaries
  - The iOS version will also be looked at in the same way but files will be fairly similar
  - There are code obfuscation methods available in Unity
Unity Code
  - Much of the interesting Unity code is in assets/bin/Data/Managed/Assembly as DLL files
    - For app analysis only managed DLL files are of interest 
    - Exploit developers however may find the Unity runtime environment interesting
  - Unity Code is distributed in Common Intermediate Language (CIL) format
    - Like a jar file this is non-native bytecode
Obfuscation Scope
  - This refers to what can and cannot be obfuscated
  - No Android app can be 100% obfuscated
    - Non obfuscated code can be used to infer details about obfusacated code
  - What can be obfuscated
    - Anything that the developer creates eg classes, methods etc
  - What cannot be obfuscated
    - Any third party libraries distributed as binaries
    - Any SDK API functionality
  

3 - App Report Cards
This is an important topic for both Enterprise defenders and Application analysts
  - There are many steps needed to analyse apps and this can be a daunting task
App Report Cards
  - A small resource from the instructor of the course
  - There is a need for a resource to analyse, record and then report on concerns
  - Both Android & iOS applications should be reviewed
  - App Report Cards make this analysis and reporting consistent
  - This is fundamentally a spreadsheet but with a weighted scoring system
The first sample app to be examined is the ooVoo app
  - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oovoo&hl=en
  - It is similar to and a possible competitor of Skype
  - This means that it is a hi-quality video chat app
  App Binary Tests
    - Ensure that the app is configured to use PIE
      - PIE (Position Independent Executable) (ASLR)
    - Ensure that Stack Canary protection is used
    - Also ensure that the application uses ARC memory management
      - ARC(Automatic Resource Counter) or does the developer take responsibility for memory management
    - To check if these have been turned on use otool
      - otool -hv ooVoo | grep PIE
      - otool -I -v ooVoo | stack chk
      - otool -I -v ooVoo | grep objc_release
      - The needle utility could be used 
    - Identify URL handlers
      - Examine the Info.plist file & CFBundleUrlSchemes array
      - 



                    Section 4 - Penetration Testing Mobile Devices Part 1
1 - Mobile Penetration Testing
Mobile Penetration Tesing
  - Evaluation of the device environment for potential vulnerabilities
  - Once vulnerabilities have been discovered then the exploitation of them and unauthorised use of resources
  - Organisations will have risks and the data resources will need to be examined to quantify risks
  - Steps must be applied for each target areas under test
  - Mobile Penetration Testing means different things to different people
When talking about Mobile Penetration Tesing here it does not mean using a mobile device to do a Pen Test
  - These can be useful but more for convenience and are not recommended by the instructor
Mobile Penetration Tesing needs to be specific about what is being tested
  - This can be a difficult question to answer
  - Typically several different areas are tested
    - App Components
    - Wirelessly connected devices such as Phones & Tablets
    - Where mobile data is backed up to such as Desktops, Servers etc
    - Deployment supporting infrastructure
    - Back-end systems that support system configuration
    - Cloud Systems
    - Physically possessing a device
  - Complexity in an environment can help a Pen Tester
The Roles is a Pen Test
  - Understanding the techniques behind Mobile Penetration Tesing can be beneficial for different audience types
    - Pen Testers who are seeking to expand or update skill sets
    - There are analysts who will learn about testing secure deployments
    - Any auditors who need to determine if the auditing performed has been sufficient
  - There is also value from having non-technical people understand some material
    - For people hiring or procuring tests or testers there should be the abilty to evaluate testing
    - To determine the competency of consultants
