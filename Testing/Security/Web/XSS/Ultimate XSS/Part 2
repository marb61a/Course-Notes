                    The Ultimate XSS Training Course
                    Course Notes Part 2


XSS Filter Evasion (Cont)
  - Creativity and persistence will be needed in some cases
    - What would happen if each nstance of javascript: or alert() was filtered
  - Using the JavaScript URLs with Filtering example
    - This will filter out the javascript:alert()
  - You may be able to get past some of the filtering by changing character cases
    - Other things to try include adding tabs and spaces
    - There will be a lot of examples online
  - Custom filtering is not going to save a site from attack

How To Use Event Handlers For XSS Exploits
  - Fine-tuning event handlers for exploits
  - In order to understand XSS you must understand exploit techniques
  - You should understand how attackers are going to attack your applications
  - There are 2 qualities that must be met for an exploit to be high quality
    - It must execute quickly
    - The attack must remain undetected
  - Using event handlers properly in exploits will require a higher level of skill
  - Using the Exploit With Event Handlers example
  - There is a small "share this page" link at the end of the page
    - Using the dev tools inspector shows a data-url attribute currently set to its present URL
    - Adding a payload to the url is the vulnerability
      - url#"onclick="alert() - each time that the element is click will cause the alert to popup
      - onclick may not be the best choice, onmouseover may be a better option along with some CSS styling
      - CSS styles can be used in tags with the style attribute
  - Continuing the above example using the mouseover with styles combination instead
    - url#"onmouseover=alert() style=position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100%25;
      - Elements are usually positioned where they appear in the html but can be changed in this case using the position attribute
      - This will position the element at the top of the page and beginning
      - Some characters will need to be URLEncoded
        - This is done by taking the character and adding the Hex value eg % becomes %25
      - Semi colons can be left at this juncture as it is in the hash rather than as a query parameter
