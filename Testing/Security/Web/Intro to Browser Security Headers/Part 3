 4 - The pin-sha256 Directive
  - Public-Key-Pins:
    pin-sha256=[pin1];pin-sha256=[pin2];
    max-age=2592000; report-uri=[uri]; includeSubdomains
  - The above contains 2 pins not 1
  - When key-pins are used there must be at least 2
    - More specifically there must be at least 2 hashes of the certificate thumbprint
    - The reason for 2 is to ensure that there is a backup
  - The thumbprint can come from any certificate in the cert chain
