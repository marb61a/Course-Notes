                    Section 4 - Clickjacking
1 - Introducing Clickjacking
A quick demo of the clickjacking process
  - Often there is a domain/subdomain very similar to a legitimate one used
  - The illegitimate domain is then placed into an iFrame
  - Its opacity is set to 0 and users therefore think that they are clicking on a legitimate page
  - One of the most famous attacks is the Adobe Global Flash Security Settings Page
  - This falls in the UI redress attack category
  - It can also be used for capturing keystrokes
  - Some of the more sophisticated versions are very difficult to detect

1 - Introducing Third Party Assets
Items that fall under third party assets include
  - Non hosted scripts
  - Version dependency for use in development eg "express": "^4.15.2"
    - This is fuzzy as there as multiple possible versions as the ^ signifies from this version up
  - Tracking code eg Google Analytics
    - This maybe the worst of the three
    - The example code is used togenerate its own script tag which then pulls in the real code it uses
