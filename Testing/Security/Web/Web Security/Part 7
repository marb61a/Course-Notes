                    Course Notes Part 7


                    Section 4 - Clickjacking
1 - Introducing Clickjacking
A quick demo of the clickjacking process
  - Often there is a domain/subdomain very similar to a legitimate one used
  - The illegitimate domain is then placed into an iFrame
  - Its opacity is set to 0 and users therefore think that they are clicking on a legitimate page
  - One of the most famous attacks is the Adobe Global Flash Security Settings Page
  - This falls in the UI redress attack category
  - It can also be used for capturing keystrokes
  - Some of the more sophisticated versions are very difficult to detect

2 - Challenge 6: Clickjacking
The challenge here is

3 - Challenge 6: Solution

4 - Stopping Clickjacking
  - Defending against clickjacking in modern browsers
  - X-Frame-Options -> This is a HTTP response header
    - This informs the browser what it is allowed to do to a document, it will not know until it downloads the specific document
    - This can not be put inside another page, it must be the top level frame inside a browser tab
    - X-Frame-Options: DENY
    - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    - X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://abc.com
  - Chrome & Safari do not respect ALLOW-FROM
    - In this case the Frame-ancestors CSP directive will have to be used instead

5 - Challenge 7: Defend Against Clickjacking

6 - Challenge 7: Solution



                    Section 5 - Third Party Assets
1 - Introducing Third Party Assets
Items that fall under third party assets include
  - Non hosted scripts
  - Version dependency for use in development eg "express": "^4.15.2"
    - This is fuzzy as there as multiple possible versions as the ^ signifies from this version up
  - Tracking code eg Google Analytics
    - This maybe the worst of the three
    - The example code is used togenerate its own script tag which then pulls in the real code it uses
