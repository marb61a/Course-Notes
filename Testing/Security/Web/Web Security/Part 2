                    Course Notes Part 2


Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
1 - Introducing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Client Side Attacks
  - The first client side attack to be discussed is also the most prevalent XSS
    - It is called XSS because CSS already means something else
    - It is basically putting code where text is expected and tricking the browser into executing the code
    - It is an injection attack
    - Vulnerabilities are prevalent
      - The number of sites vulnerable is a minimum of 30%
      - Accurate data is not easy to obtain as most reports are from firms selling pen testing services
    - It allows an attacker to read data or perform operations on a users behalf
    - Example code which could allow XSS
      - This is ejs (embedded JS)
      <h1>Welcome, <%- name %></h1>
      name = "Mike";
      // Welcome Mike is returned
      // What would happen if code was injected
      <h1>Welcome, <%- name %></h1>
      name = "Mike<script>terrible()</script>"
      // This would be returned and the terrible script ran
      <h1>Welcome, Mike<script>terrible()</script></h1>

2 - Types of XSS Attacks
There are 4 main categories of XSS attacks
  - The instructor says 3 + 1 as the final one is debatable
  - Stored XSS
    - Code that executes the attackers script is persisted
    - This is usually added to a database
  - Reflected XSS
    - Transient response from a server causes a script to execute
    - A temporary server response can be tricked in to executing code
  - DOM Based XSS
    - These attacks do not have any server involvement
    - This means that code is passed in via queryParams
  - Blind XSS
    - It could be argued that this is the same as Stored XSS
    - This exploits a vulnerability in another app that an attacker cannot see or access under normal means
      - The example used is of a log reader app
      - There is likely to be less scrutiny of an internal app
      - These internal apps usually pull in public data so are attack vectors

3 - Locations for XSS Attacks
There are several XSS danger zones where attacks can happen
  - User-generated rich content eg WYSIWYG
  - Embedded content eg IFrame
  - Anywhere where users have control over a URL
    - Older browsers allowed url's like -- javascript:image_url
  - Anywhere that user input is reflected back
  - QueryParameters that are rendered into DOM
  - element.innerHTML = ?
    - This is a very easy exploit as it allows script tags

4 - XSS Attack Demonstration
Using the Linux distro Kali for demonstration
  - https://www.kali.org
  - This has a whole suite of security tools
  - The tools themselves can be used for good and bad
  - The course demonstrates an ARP attack
    - Web developers don't usually know how these things work
  - HTTPS can obviate some of the ARP attacks
  - There can be simple XSS attacks that do not need to be crafted
  - Phonegap and similar can be very dangerous
    - Ionic is highly optimised Phonegap
    - Most dangerous is the frameworks that essentially use webview iframes
      - These can break through traditional web app sandboxing
      - This is dangerous as Javascript binds to native functions and breaks through mobile sandboxes

5 - Prevent XSS Attacks Quiz
XSS - As a feature
  - Some companies are starting to treat XSS as a feature
    - This includes ISP companies and is an argument in favour of net neutrality
  - This is a very bad idea
    - A compnay called XFinity has been injecting its script on Reddit
XSS Questions you should ask yourself
  - How confident are you in the XSS protection of your OSS libraries
    - One thing that should be looked for particularly in a view library is that
      - There is a procedure for resolving security issues eg email address that supports specific issues
      - GitHub issues are not appropriate in this case
      - Be careful about using browsers older than supported
  - How carefully do people scrutinize browser plugins
    - Few people read the full permissions of plugins
    - Be skeptical of plugins asking for permissions going beyond what is needed
    - Instructor suggests using incognito tab for online banking
  - If XSS happens what is the exposure
  - In your app waht could a successful XSS attack escalate to 
    - This will differ form one organisation to another
    - This will also determine bug fixes etc at compromise will take precedence

6 - Challenge 1: XSS Attack
There are 3 XSS vulnerabilities in the sample app
  - 2 of these are Reflected-XSS
  - Use multiple browsers to simulate multiple users
  - Students should try use at least one legacy browser when testing
  - Hosting can be done locally using *.lvh.me
    - This is essentially a DNS trick that resolves to localhost
    - It allows for having multiple domains, which is good for experimenting
The sample app
  - Will have to be cloned from a GitHub repo
  - Use yarn to install the packages
  - When registering in the app do not use a password that is used elsewhere
  - The challenge is to find the other 2 XSS vulnerabilities

7 - Challenge 1: Solution
The solutions to the XSS challenges
  - When creating an account HTML tags can be added
    - In the example this is a <b> tag which makes things bold
    - This should be eliminated without being run as it means other code will be run
  - The next vulnerability is both a stored and reflected vulnerability
    - This happens after an account with a script is ran
    - The account is registered without warnings and a success message is shown
    - Inspecting the element shows the script tags inside the panel
  - The third vulnerabiity is found on the profile page
    - In the url the user is listed which should not happen
    - Adding a script tag is ran which would not happen in modern browsers
    - There is a console.log added in the script tags to stop pattern matching which would stop the script being ran

8 - User Data
XSS Defenses - You should never put untrusted data in the following places
  - Directly in a script -- EG <script> <%- userData %> </script>
  - In a HTML comment -- EG <!--- <%- userData %> --->
  - In an attribute name -- EG <iframe <%- userData %>="myValue" />
  - In a tag name -- EG <<%- userData %> class="myElement">
  - Directly in a style block -- EG <style> <%- userData %> </style>
    - This is very difficult to do in modern browsers
  - On a general basis never trust raw user data
  - Escape user data before putting it into HTML, there are 2 things which you should do
    - Sanitize user data prior to persisting
    - Then sanitize it prior to being rendered to a screen
    - You should typically do both of these
    - Its easier to sanitize before rendering than worrying about disallowing all bad things without interfering with
      genuine user input
Example Syntax
  <script>alert('hi')</script>
  // This is gotten by using encodeURIComponent() function
  "%3Cscript%3Ealert('hi')%3C%2Fscript%3E"
  - Most view libraries do this automatically
  - EJS is used for the class and its the following
    <%= "Escaped Expression" %>
    <%- "Unescaped Expression" %>
    <% "Non-Rendered Expression" %>

9 - Sanitizing User Data
XSS Defenses - If you unescape then sanitize data first
  - These are some cheats for different libraries so you will know when you are in a danger zone
    - Ember & Vue -- {{{ "unescaped" }}}
      - This string will be treated as Html 
    - React -- return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()}/>;
    - Ejs -- <%- "Unescaped" %>
      - The course example app has a couple of examples of this issue which will need to be fixed
      - In this case the minus sign needs to be changed to an equals
    - Angular -- <div [innerHTML]="unescaped"></div>
    - Jade -- ! This is #{"<b>unescaped</b>"}!
Escape before putting user data in attributes
  - <div class="<%= 'UserValue' %>"></div>
  - Be especially careful of this when templating Javascript
    - <script>alert("Hello <%- userValue %>")</script>
  - Recommended to use https://github.com/ESAPI/node-esapi
    - This will check your app for issues, it is highly recommended by the instructor
  - User input should be treated as values not code

10 - Content Security Policy (CSP)
XSS Defenses Content Security Policy
  - Browsers cannot tell the difference between scripts downloaded from you origin vs another
    - This is called a single execution context
  - CSP allows modern browsers to be told which sources they should trust and for what type of resources
  - This information comes from a HTTP response header or meta tag
      - Content-Security_Policy: script-src 'self' https://example.example
                                 ---------         -----------------------
                                   name             sources
                                |--------------- directive ----------------|
                                
    - Multiple directives are allowed and are separated by semi-colon
    - Redefining a driective with the same name has no effect
    - By default directives are permissive
      - Content-Security-Policy: script-src: 'self' https://example.example;
                                 font-src: https://fonts.googleapis.com
  - There are some useful CSP directives
    - child-src -- Child execution contexts eg frames, workers
    - connect-src -- What you can connect to such as fetch, WebSocket, EventSource
    - form-action -- Where you can <form> submit to
    - img-src, media-src, object-src -- Where you can get images, media etc from
    - style-src -- Where external stylesheets can come from
    - upgrade-insecure-requests - Upgrades HTTP requests to HTTPS
    - default-src -- A fallback for when a specific directive is not provided
  - There are also some keywords which can be used alongside sources which are typically origins
    - none -- No sources allowed
    - self -- Current origin
    - unsafe-inline -- Allows inline JS and CSS
    - unsafe-eval -- Allows eval()
      - This is used by templating frameworks where a string is sent and evaluated juust in time
      - This improves the performance of webpages
 There are a few ways the unsafe-inline can be made a little safer
  - Script tags embedded in HTML is the most common form of XSS and banning it mitigates risk considerably
  - There are times however where JavaScript is needed and there are solutions
  - Cryptographic nonces must be generated per page load and must change unpredictably
Example Syntax
  // Cryptographic nonce example
  <script nonce=A9h3pdfn3f03nce8DnMIOErd7Gb>
    alert('This example is done inlne');
  </script>
  
  Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-A9h3pdfn3f03nce8DnMIOErd7Gb'
  
  Another way to do this is to add a checksum to the security policy 
    - Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'sha256-absd182.....='
    - The easiest way to define this is to use the browser itself
    - Use the error generated and move that into the CSP

11 - Challenge 2: Defend Against XSS Attacks
Implementing XSS defences
  - Custom linting rules can be used to scan and eliminate unsafe-inline
  - This also is useful with a Git pre-commit hook
  - Eliminating using automation is a good idea and it should be done as early as possible
The exercise in this section is to
  - Fix 3 XSS issues
  - Add a reasonable CSP to the example project
    - There is a library available to help with this
      - https://github.com/helmetjs/csp

12 - Challenge 2: Solution, Part 1
The example uses the VS Code IDE search facility which will search for a pattern
  - In this case it is the <%- pattern to be eliminated
  - Some may need to be kept otherwise use <%=
    - Most of these would be layout related eg <%- body -%>
  - There are other XSS vulnerabilities which allow users to see and manipulate other users data

13 - Challenge 2: Solution, Part 2Adding a reasonable CSP to the app
  - The HelmetJS GitHub page has a sample policy which can be used as a template and modified if needed
  - It will then need to be required in order to be used eg cont csp = require('helmet-csp'); 
  - In Express app.use is a stack of middlewares normally
  - CSP should be placed near headers in order to make for better readability
  - reportOnly is normally set to false but for testing purposes is set to true 
    - This means that things will not be blocked but you will be alerted to issues 
  - In the sample directives there is a reportUri directive
    - reportUri: '/report-violation'
    - You can specify an endpoint where errors can be sent from browsers that detect violations
    - This can be used for what is called by some a dynamic-kill-switch
    - This allows for session\user termination for CSP violation and is a good place to hook in security software
    - There are downsides though as information about user status could be available
      - Information from outside domains can bleed through and inferences about user permissions can be drawn
  - The sandbox directive will deal with I-Frames
    - sandbox: ['allow-forms', 'allow-scripts']
    - Basically only I-Frames with the sandbox attribute will be allowed
    - This will limit the functionality of I-Frames
  - The values must be in the valid CSP format between quotes
  - Eliminating inline styles will eliminate an XSS vector completely
    - This is CSS best practice 

14 - Malicious Attachments
This will not completely protect you due to malicious attachments
    - Documents can have embedded code and are not inert
    - PDF files have had trojans added to them which will cause problems
  - Images can also have malware embedded
    - Changing image extensions can cause problems, the example uses jpg changed to html
    - The html in images can have links embedded
  - Allowing users to share attachments can help spread malware

15 - Challenge 3: XSS Attachment
This is an explation of the exercise that students will perform
Attack - XSS Attachment
  - This is broken down into a scenario based exercise
    - Image uploads are allowed in the scenario
    - These are hosted in the same domain as the app
    - There is a need to ensure that uploads are in fact images
    - Users have the ability to rename files
    - Check what happens when you visit the url of a particular renamed image
  - Students are allowed to see how far some of this goes

16 - Challenge 3: Solution
The tool that is used in the example is exif.js
  - Read the Exif comment field and pipe it into the clipboard, the command is as follows
    - node ./scripts/exif.js read ./examples/squirrel.jpg | pbcopy
  - Replace the Exif comment field with the content of a HTML file, the command is as follows
    - node ./scripts/exif.js write ./examples/squirrel.jpg scratch.html
    - One note is that it must all go on to one line, this is because you cannot have a multiline HTML file name
Browser will treat a document and image request completely differently
Using pbcopy will add something to the clipboard
The exif.js library is filetype sensitive

17 - Stopping Malicious Attachments
There are defenses available to combat XSS Attachment attacks
  - Restrict the file types that can be uploaded and also the ability to access these types
    - This reduces how much of an XSS vector an app is
    - Do not blindly trust filetypes
  - When using images, compression usually eliminates non-visible data and is best practice so use this
  - Do research before allowing file types eg PDF's can execute Javascript which a lot of people do not realise
    - Some browsers will allow this straight away    



                    Section 3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
1 - Introducing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery
  - This type of attack takes advantage of the fact that cookies for basic authentication are passed along with requests
  - This is one reason to align with REST conventions (GET, POST, DELETE etc)

                    Section 4 - Clickjacking
1 - Introducing Clickjacking
A quick demo of the clickjacking process
  - Often there is a domain/subdomain very similar to a legitimate one used
  - The illegitimate domain is then placed into an iFrame
  - Its opacity is set to 0 and users therefore think that they are clicking on a legitimate page
  - One of the most famous attacks is the Adobe Global Flash Security Settings Page
  - This falls in the UI redress attack category
  - It can also be used for capturing keystrokes
  - Some of the more sophisticated versions are very difficult to detect

                    Section 5 - Third Party Assets
1 - Introducing Third Party Assets
Items that fall under third party assets include
  - Non hosted scripts
  - Version dependency for use in development eg "express": "^4.15.2"
    - This is fuzzy as there as multiple possible versions as the ^ signifies from this version up
  - Tracking code eg Google Analytics
    - This maybe the worst of the three
    - The example code is used togenerate its own script tag which then pulls in the real code it uses
