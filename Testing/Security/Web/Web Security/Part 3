                    Course Notes Part 3


Prevent XSS Attacks Quiz
XSS - As a feature
  - Some companies are starting to treat XSS as a feature
    - This includes ISP companies and is an argument in favour of net neutrality
  - This is a very bad idea
    - A compnay called XFinity has been injecting its script on Reddit
XSS Questions you should ask yourself
  - How confident are you in the XSS protection of your OSS libraries
    - One thing that should be looked for particularly in a view library is that
      - There is a procedure for resolving security issues eg email address that supports specific issues
      - GitHub issues are not appropriate in this case
      - Be careful about using browsers older than supported
  - How carefully do people scrutinize browser plugins
    - Few people read the full permissions of plugins
    - Be skeptical of plugins asking for permissions going beyond what is needed
    - Instructor suggests using incognito tab for online banking
  - If XSS happens what is the exposure
  - In your app waht could a successful XSS attack escalate to 
    - This will differ form one organisation to another
    - This will also determine bug fixes etc at compromise will take precedence

Challenge 1: XSS Attack
There are 3 XSS vulnerabilities in the sample app
  - 2 of these are Reflected-XSS
  - Use multiple browsers to simulate multiple users
  - Students should try use at least one legacy browser when testing
  - Hosting can be done locally using *.lvh.me
    - This is essentially a DNS trick that resolves to localhost
    - It allows for having multiple domains, which is good for experimenting
The sample app
  - Will have to be cloned from a GitHub repo
  - Use yarn to install the packages
  - When registering in the app do not use a password that is used elsewhere
  - The challenge is to find the other 2 XSS vulnerabilities

Challenge 1: Solution
The solutions to the XSS challenges
  - When creating an account HTML tags can be added
    - In the example this is a <b> tag which makes things bold
    - This should be eliminated without being run as it means other code will be run
  - The next vulnerability is both a stored and reflected vulnerability
    - This happens after an account with a script is ran
    - The account is registered without warnings and a success message is shown
    - Inspecting the element shows the script tags inside the panel
  - The third vulnerabiity is found on the profile page
    - In the url the user is listed which should not happen
    - Adding a script tag is ran which would not happen in modern browsers
    - There is a console.log added in the script tags to stop pattern matching which would stop the script being ran

User Data
XSS Defenses - You should never put untrusted data in the following places
  - Directly in a script -- EG <script> <%- userData %> </script>
  - In a HTML comment -- EG <!--- <%- userData %> --->
  - In an attribute name -- EG <iframe <%- userData %>="myValue" />
  - In a tag name -- EG <<%- userData %> class="myElement">
  - Directly in a style block -- EG <style> <%- userData %> </style>
    - This is very difficult to do in modern browsers
  - On a general basis never trust raw user data
  - Escape user data before putting it into HTML, there are 2 things which you should do
    - Sanitize user data prior to persisting
    - Then sanitize it prior to being rendered to a screen
    - You should typically do both of these
    - Its easier to sanitize before rendering than worrying about disallowing all bad things without interfering with
      genuine user input
Example Syntax
  <script>alert('hi')</script>
  // This is gotten by using encodeURIComponent() function
  "%3Cscript%3Ealert('hi')%3C%2Fscript%3E"
  - Most view libraries do this automatically
  - EJS is used for the class and its the following
    <%= "Escaped Expression" %>
    <%- "Unescaped Expression" %>
    <% "Non-Rendered Expression" %>
