                    REST API Design, Development, Security, Testing & Management
                    Course Notes Part 1


Section 1: Introduction
Quick guide to the course by the instructor
  - The course will be based around Java

Section 2: API and API Management
API and SOAP
  - API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface
  - API Management platforms generally manage two kinds of APIs
    - REST: REpresentational State Transfer
      - Most modern API's are based on REST
	  - SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol
SOAP was the next and major step in Distributed Computing
This is because of the two reasons
  - Service (functionality) accessible over Web or HTTP
  - It was a standard
SOAP uses XML
This allowed SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) to evolve
There are some drawbacks of using SOAP
	- Heavy weight protocol: WS-Addressing, WS-Transactions, WS-Security
	- XML: Messages are bigger
	- Complex 
	- Handling needs more computing resources
	- Simple testing is also not simple
