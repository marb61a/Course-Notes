                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 7


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Session (Cont)
  - As an alternative to session cookies, session IDâ€™s can also be sent via the GET method appended to the requesting URL

Web Application Proxies 
  - Most web applications contains a great deal of objects like scripts, images, style sheets etc
  - Having tools that help in the study and analysis of web application behavior is critical
  - An intercepting proxy is a tool that lets you analyse and modify any request and any response exchanged between a HTTP client and server
    - By intercepting HTTP messages a pentester can study a web application behavior and manually test for vulnerabilities
  - The most used web application proxies are Burp Suite and ZAP
    - There are notes available on testing Web Apps at
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Testing/Compendium Dev/Technical Web Testing 101
  - Using proxies is fundamental in analysing web apps
  - There is a difference between intercepting proxies and common web proxy servers such as Squid
    - Proxy servers have different purposes: bandwidth optimization, content filtering and more
  - Burp Suite is very recommended and has a free community edition
    - https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload
  - Burp Suite will allow a tester to do many things
    - Intercept requests and responses between your browser and the web server
      - You can also modify the responses that servers send
    - Manually buil requests such as GET or POST manually
    - Crawl a website, by automatically visiting every page in a website
    - Fuzz web applications, by sending patterns of valid and invalid inputs to test their behavior
  - A brief tutorial on configuring Burp 
    - The contents is similar to the notes mentioned above
  


Module 3 : Information Gathering
Gathering Information on Your Targets
  - Information gathering is the very first and most critical step of every penetration test
    - No matter what the assignment a tester needs to know as much about targets as possible
  - Most pentesting jobs are black-box tests
  - During a black-box test, penetration testers simulate external hacker attacks
    - It is because of this that they cannot know anything about the inner workings, processes etc of the client
    - This makes the information they can find all the more critical
  - Gathering information about the target is the initial phase of any penetration test
    - A lot of the time this is the most important part of the engagement
  - There is no unnecessary information at this stage, everything should be noted for future use
  - There are different types of information that is sought
    - Infrastructure information, App Login, Virtual Hosts, IP addresses, Domains and Sub-Domains
  - The first step to take when assessing a website is to gather information about the organisation
    - WHOIS lookups were traditionally done using a command line interface
    - A number of simplified web-based tools now exist for looking up domain ownership details from different databases
    - Web-based WHOIS clients still rely on the WHOIS protocol to connect to a WHOIS server and do lookup
    - Command line WHOIS clients are still widely used 
    - WHOIS will usually run on TCP port 43
  - You can perform Whois queries by using the whois *nix command or by installing the Sysinternal Whois utility
    - If using *nix based systems there are many options that can be set, to list run the whois -h command
  - Instead of using the command line tools, you can also rely on web-based tools such as: whois.domaintools.com
  - The Whois database contains public information, so you can freely check it
    - A tester can get can get the IP address of one of the machines of the organisation being tested
  - After getting some information about a target it is to start digging further into the data to start identifying individual targets
  - A valuable source for such information is the Domain Name System (DNS)
  - DNS can be queried for some of the IP addresses that we received from the WHOIS database
  - The DNS structure contains a hierarchy of names
    - The root, or highest level of the system is unnamed
    - Top Level Domains (TLDs) are divided into classes based on rules that have evolved over time
    - Most TLDs have been delegated to individual country managers, whose codes are assigned from a table known as ISO-3166-1
      - These are maintained by an agency of the United Nations and are called country-code Top Level Domains, or ccTLDs
    - There are also a limited number of "generic" Top Level Domains (gTLDs) which do not have a geographic or country designation
    - Responsibility for procedures and policies for assigning Second Level Domain Names and lower level hierarchies of names has been delegated to TLD managers
    - Country code domains are organized by a manager for that country
      - These managers perform a public service on behalf of the Internet community
  - DNS queries produce listing called Resource Records
    - A Resource Record begins with a domain name usually a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
      - If anything other than an FQDN is used, the name of the zone the record is in will automatically be appended to the end of the name
    - Time-To-Live (TTL), in seconds, defaults to the minimum value determined in the SOA record
    - The Record Class is either Internet, Hesiod, or Chaos 
    - Start of Authority Indicates the beginning of a zone and it should occur first in a zone file
      - There can be only one SOA record per zone
      - Defines certain values for the zone such as a serial number and various expiration timeouts 
    - Name Server which defines an authoritative name server for a zone
      - Defines and delegates authority to a name server for a child zone
      - NS Records are really the glue that binds the distributed database together
    - Address, The A record simply maps a hostname to an IP address
      - Zones with A records are called 'forward' zones
    - Pointer or PTR, The PTR record maps an IP address to a Hostname
      - Zones with PTR records are called 'reverse' zones
    - The CNAME record maps an alias hostname to an A record hostname
    - Mail Exchange (MX), The MX record specifies a host that will accept email on behalf of a given host
      - The specified host has an associated priority value 
      - A single host may have multiple MX records
      - The records for a specific host make up a prioritized list
  - The domain name system (DNS) is a distributed database arranged hierarchically
    - Its purpose is to provide a layer of abstraction between Internet services (web, email, etc.) and the numeric addresses (IP addresses)
  - This approach has several advantages
    - It permits the use of names instead of numbers to identify hosts (usually servers) 
    - Names are much easier to remember 
    - It permits a server to change numeric addresses without requiring notification of everyone on the Internet
      - This is done by  simply retargeting a name to the new numeric address 
    - One name can refer to multiple hosts, to share the load
