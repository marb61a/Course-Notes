                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 7


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Session (Cont)
  - As an alternative to session cookies, session IDâ€™s can also be sent via the GET method appended to the requesting URL

Web Application Proxies 
  - Most web applications contains a great deal of objects like scripts, images, style sheets etc
  - Having tools that help in the study and analysis of web application behavior is critical
  - An intercepting proxy is a tool that lets you analyse and modify any request and any response exchanged between a HTTP client and server
    - By intercepting HTTP messages a pentester can study a web application behavior and manually test for vulnerabilities
  - The most used web application proxies are Burp Suite and ZAP
    - There are notes available on testing Web Apps at
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Testing/Compendium Dev/Technical Web Testing 101
  - Using proxies is fundamental in analysing web apps
  - There is a difference between intercepting proxies and common web proxy servers such as Squid
    - Proxy servers have different purposes: bandwidth optimization, content filtering and more
  - Burp Suite is very recommended and has a free community edition

  - Burp Suite will allow a tester to do many things
