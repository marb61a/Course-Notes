                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 7


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Session (Cont)
  - As an alternative to session cookies, session IDâ€™s can also be sent via the GET method appended to the requesting URL

Web Application Proxies 
  - Most web applications contains a great deal of objects like scripts, images, style sheets etc
  - Having tools that help in the study and analysis of web application behavior is critical
  - An intercepting proxy is a tool that lets you analyse and modify any request and any response exchanged between a HTTP client and server
    - By intercepting HTTP messages a pentester can study a web application behavior and manually test for vulnerabilities
  - The most used web application proxies are Burp Suite and ZAP
    - There are notes available on testing Web Apps at
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Testing/Compendium Dev/Technical Web Testing 101
  - Using proxies is fundamental in analysing web apps
  - There is a difference between intercepting proxies and common web proxy servers such as Squid
    - Proxy servers have different purposes: bandwidth optimization, content filtering and more
  - Burp Suite is very recommended and has a free community edition
    - https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload
  - Burp Suite will allow a tester to do many things
    - Intercept requests and responses between your browser and the web server
      - You can also modify the responses that servers send
    - Manually buil requests such as GET or POST manually
    - Crawl a website, by automatically visiting every page in a website
    - Fuzz web applications, by sending patterns of valid and invalid inputs to test their behavior
  - A brief tutorial on configuring Burp 
    - The contents is similar to the notes mentioned above
  


Module 3 : Information Gathering
Gathering Information on Your Targets
  - Information gathering is the very first and most critical step of every penetration test
    - No matter what the assignment a tester needs to know as much about targets as possible
  - Most pentesting jobs are black-box tests
  - During a black-box test, penetration testers simulate external hacker attacks
    - It is because of this that they cannot know anything about the inner workings, processes etc of the client
    - This makes the information they can find all the more critical
  - Gathering information about the target is the initial phase of any penetration test
    - A lot of the time this is the most important part of the engagement
  - There is no unnecessary information at this stage, everything should be noted for future use
  - There are different types of information that is sought
    - Infrastructure information, App Login, Virtual Hosts, IP addresses, Domains and Sub-Domains
  - The first step to take when assessing a website is to gather information about the organisation
    - WHOIS lookups were traditionally done using a command line interface
