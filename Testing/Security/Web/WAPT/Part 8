                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 8


Module 3 : Information Gathering (Cont)
Gathering Information on Your Targets (Cont)
  - Nslookup is another very handy tool that lets you translate hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa
  - There are different ways of running for different OS
    - On Windows click Start -> Run -> cmd -> nslookup google.com
    - On *nix open a console and type nslookup google.com
  - The previous query is referred to as a lookup or as seen previously, it is an "A"
    - If you provide a domain name, DNS returns the IP  addresses for the matching hosts
  - If you provide an IP address, DNS returns the domain name associated with that IP
    - 172.194.113.224 is the IP address found for the above lookup
  - Trying to query the DNS of google for the whole record
    - nslookup -querytype=ANY google.com
    - The previous command returns the following important information
      - Name Servers, CNAME's, A Records, MX
    - This information should be saved for the subsequent steps of your penetration testing engagement
  - Every IP address on the Internet is assigned to an organisation
    - An organisation can purchase a block of IP addresses according to their needs and it will "own" that entire block
    - The whois database tracks the owners of public IP addresses as well as domain names
  - Sometimes organisations are not  the owners of the IP addresses they use for their presence on the internet
    - They may just rely on ISPs and hosting companies that lease one or more smaller netblocks to them
    - Finding the netblock owner and the ISPs our target relies on is an important step in testing
  - Another example of nslookup this time is to know know which ISP's, hosting and IP addresses our target uses
    - Using Nslookup we get the IP addresses associated to each subdomain
    - We will perform a whois request for each of these IP addresses to uncover the ISP's that these IP addresses belong to
    - When the organisation is big, net-blocks may be assigned directly to it, so no Hosting services are involved
    - The first step is to gather all the IP addresses related to a domain or subdomain

Infrastructure 
  - The infrastructure behind a web application is what supports it and allows it to function
    - This includes the web server that is directly involved in the execution of any web application
    - The two most common web servers used on the internet today are Apache and Microsoft IIS
  - Discovering what kind of web server is behind your application will give you a hint about what OS the server is running 
    - This in turn shows what vulnerabilities could be applied
    - For example discovering an IIS (Internet Information Service) web server will tip us off that the server is running an OS in the Windows Server OS family
      - These guesses are correct in 90% of the cases when dealing with IIS and Windows Server 
      - This is different in the many different Linux and BSD distributions which may run different Apache versions
  - Although hacking into the server operating system is beyond the scope of our web application test engagement
    -Having a clear understandin of the infrastructure will be really useful in the next testing steps
  - Uncovering both the web server type and version will give us enough information to mount many different attacks against its components 
    - IIS components, usually called ISAPI extensions, work as dynamic libraries
    - These extend the functionalities of the web server and performing different tasks for the web server
