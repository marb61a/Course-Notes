Module 3 : Information Gathering (Cont)
Gathering Information on Your Targets (Cont)
  - Nslookup is another very handy tool that lets you translate hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa
  - There are different ways of running for different OS
    - On Windows click Start -> Run -> cmd -> nslookup google.com
    - On *nix open a console and type nslookup google.com
  - The previous query is referred to as a lookup or as seen previously, it is an "A"
    - If you provide a domain name, DNS returns the IP  addresses for the matching hosts
  - If you provide an IP address, DNS returns the domain name associated with that IP
    - 172.194.113.224 is the IP address found for the above lookup
  - Trying to query the DNS of google for the whole record
    - nslookup -querytype=ANY google.com
    - The previous command returns the following important information
      - Name Servers, CNAME's, A Records, MX
    - This information should be saved for the subsequent steps of your penetration testing engagement
  - Every IP address on the Internet is assigned to an organisation
