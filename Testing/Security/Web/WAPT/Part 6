                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 6


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Cookies (Cont)
  - A server can set a cookie via the Set-Cookie HTTP header field in a response message
  -  A cookie has a predefined format and has several fields
    - Domain -- A website only sets a cookie for its domain
      - google.com sets a cookie for the domain: google.com  or .google.com
      - The browser will install a cookie in the cookie jar and will send subsequent requests to the domain
        - This will include google.com, www.google.com, maps.google.com 
      - The scope of this cookie will be *.google.com 
      - Domain A cannot set a cookie for Domain B
        - The browser will sends A's cookie in accordance with the above domain scope 
        - This is to A and all of its subdomains including the path and the expiration date
      - There are a couple of important items to consider about the Domain field
        - A leading . if it is present will be ignored
        - If the server does not specify the domain attribute then the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and the cookie host-only flag
          - This means that the cookie will be sent only to that precise hostname 
    - Expires -- gives the cookie a time constraint
      - The cookie will only be sent to the server if it is not expired
      - Session cookies expire when the session exits
    - Path whose field specifies for which requests, within that domain, the browser needs to send the cookie
      - Example For cookies with path =/downloads, all subsequent requests to the following will include this cookie
        - /downloads , /downloads/foo, /downloads/foo/bar
        - There will not be cookies for /members or /blog etc
    - Content
      - A cookie can carry a number of values at once
      -  A server can set multiple values with a single Set-Cookie header by specifying multiple KEY=Value pairs
        - Example -- Username="Jack"; Authenticated="1"
    - HttpOnly flag which is used to force the browser to send the cookie only through HTTP
      - This flag prevents the cookie from being read via JavaScript, Flash, Java and any other non-HTML technology
        - This is a mechanism to protect against cookie stealing via XSS
    - Secure Flag which forces the browser to send the cookie only through HTTPS 
      - This prevents the cookie from being sent in the clear
  - The domain attribute represents the domain value for which the cookie is valid
    - Along with the path, secure and expires attributes, it is useful during the process in determining if a cookie must be submitted along with a new HTTP request
    - RFC6265 distinguishes cookies set with a specified domain value from cookies without
