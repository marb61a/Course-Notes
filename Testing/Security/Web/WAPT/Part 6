                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 6


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Cookies (Cont)
  - A server can set a cookie via the Set-Cookie HTTP header field in a response message
  -  A cookie has a predefined format and has several fields
    - Domain -- A website only sets a cookie for its domain
      - google.com sets a cookie for the domain: google.com  or .google.com
      - The browser will install a cookie in the cookie jar and will send subsequent requests to the domain
        - This will include google.com, www.google.com, maps.google.com 
      - The scope of this cookie will be *.google.com 
      - Domain A cannot set a cookie for Domain B
        - The browser will sends A's cookie in accordance with the above domain scope 
        - This is to A and all of its subdomains including the path and the expiration date
      - There are a couple of important items to consider about the Domain field
        - A leading . if it is present will be ignored
        - If the server does not specify the domain attribute then the browser will automatically set the domain as the server domain and the cookie host-only flag
          - This means that the cookie will be sent only to that precise hostname 
    - Expires -- gives the cookie a time constraint
      - The cookie will only be sent to the server if it is not expired
      - Session cookies expire when the session exits
    - Path whose field specifies for which requests, within that domain, the browser needs to send the cookie
      - Example For cookies with path =/downloads, all subsequent requests to the following will include this cookie
        - /downloads , /downloads/foo, /downloads/foo/bar
        - There will not be cookies for /members or /blog etc
    - Content
      - A cookie can carry a number of values at once
      -  A server can set multiple values with a single Set-Cookie header by specifying multiple KEY=Value pairs
        - Example -- Username="Jack"; Authenticated="1"
    - HttpOnly flag which is used to force the browser to send the cookie only through HTTP
      - This flag prevents the cookie from being read via JavaScript, Flash, Java and any other non-HTML technology
        - This is a mechanism to protect against cookie stealing via XSS
    - Secure Flag which forces the browser to send the cookie only through HTTPS 
      - This prevents the cookie from being sent in the clear
  - The domain attribute represents the domain value for which the cookie is valid
    - Along with the path, secure and expires attributes, it is useful during the process in determining if a cookie must be submitted along with a new HTTP request
    - RFC6265 distinguishes cookies set with a specified domain value from cookies without a specified domain value
    - An important difference in the previous RFC is the leading dot at the start of the domain value string
      - As opposed to the previous RFC the leading dot has no significance and the browser does not care about it
  - Specified Cookie Domain
    - A cookie with a domain value specified will be sent by the browser when certain conditions occur
      - The cookie domain value = the target domain
        - If the cookie domain value is abc.site.com and the target domain requested by the browser is the same
          - If a request for https://abc.site.com/index.php then the cookie will be sent
      - The cookie domain value differs from the target domain and the cookie domain value is a suffix of the target domain
        - If the cookie domain value is site.com and the target domain requested by the browser is abc.site.com
          - If a request for https://abc.site.com/index.php is sent then the cookie will be sent beacuse site.com is a suffix of abc.site.com
      - There are some security implications
        - A page on the *.site.com target domain can set a cookie with the domain value site.com
          - The reverse though is not true, a page on the site.com target domain can set a cookie with the domain value *.site.com
        - This means that lower-level subdomains can set cookies for higher domains
          - On the reverse side, higher domains cannot set cookies for lower-level subdomains
  - Unspecified cookie domain
    - When a cookie does not contain a domain value, it is assumed that the host-only-flag is set to true
    - A cookie with the host-only-flag value will be sent only to the target domain that set it
      - A brief aside is that the RFC uses the term host instead of domain
