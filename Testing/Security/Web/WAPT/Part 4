                    Course Notes Part 4


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
HTTP Protocol Basics (Cont)
  - The Accept header is used by a browser to specify which document type is expected to be returned as a result of a request
  - The Accept-Encoding is similar to Accept, but it restricts the content codings that are acceptable in the response
    - Content codings are mainly used to allow a document to be compressed or transformed
      - This will be done without losing the identity of the media type and without loss of information
  - If using HTTP 1.1 you can keep a connection to the web server open for an unspecified amount of time
    - This will be done by adding the value "keep-alive" to the connection key
    - This indicates that all requests to the web server will continue to be sent through this connection 
      - Without initiating a new connection every time 
  - In response to the HTTP Request, the web server will respond with the requested resource preceded by some new headers
    - These new headers  will be used by the browser to interpret the content contained in the Response content.
  - The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line
    - This consists of the protocol version (HTTP 1.1) 
    - Followed by a numeric status code (200) and its relative textual meaning (OK)
    - Some other common status codes are
      - 301 Moved Permanently, the requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI
      - 302 Found, the resource is temporarily under another URI
      - 403 Forbidden, the client does not have enough privileges and the server refuses to fulfill the request
      - 404 Not Found, the server cannot find a resource matching the request
      - 500 Internal Server Error, the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request
  - The Cache headers allow the Browser and the Server to agree about caching rules
    - Cached contents save bandwidth because they prevent a browser from re-requesting unchanged contents
      - This is when the same resoource is to be used
  - Content-Type lets the client know how to interpret the body of the message
  - Content-Encoding extends Content-Type
    - Often you will see some type of compression eg GZip
  - The Server header displays the Web Server banner
    - The most common servers are IIS and Apache
    - Google uses a custom webserver banner: gws which is an acronym for Google Web Server
  - Content-Length indicates the length, in bytes, of the message body
  - Page Content is the actual content of the requested resource
    - The content can be an HTML page, a document, or even a binary file
    - The type of the content is contained in the Content-type header
  - More information is available in RFC 2616
  - The best way to learn more is to try messing around in the browser
    - There are notes about using the broswer for testing purposes available at
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Testing/Compendium Dev/Technical Web Testing 101
  - HTTP content like every clear-text protocol, can be easily intercepted by an attacker on the way to its destination
    - HTTP does not provide strong authentication between the two communicating parties
  - HTTP Secure (HTTPS) or HTTP over SSL/TLS is a method to run HTTP over SSL/TLS, a cryptographic protocol
    - This layering technique provides confidentiality, integrity protection and authentication to the HTTP protocol
  - 

Encoding 
  - Information encoding is a critical component of  information technology
  - 

Same Origin 
  -

Cookies
