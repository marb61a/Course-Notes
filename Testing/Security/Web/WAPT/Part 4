                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 4


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
HTTP Protocol Basics (Cont)
  - The Accept header is used by a browser to specify which document type is expected to be returned as a result of a request
  - The Accept-Encoding is similar to Accept, but it restricts the content codings that are acceptable in the response
    - Content codings are mainly used to allow a document to be compressed or transformed
      - This will be done without losing the identity of the media type and without loss of information
  - If using HTTP 1.1 you can keep a connection to the web server open for an unspecified amount of time
    - This will be done by adding the value "keep-alive" to the connection key
    - This indicates that all requests to the web server will continue to be sent through this connection 
      - Without initiating a new connection every time 
  - In response to the HTTP Request, the web server will respond with the requested resource preceded by some new headers
    - These new headers  will be used by the browser to interpret the content contained in the Response content.
  - The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line
    - This consists of the protocol version (HTTP 1.1) 
    - Followed by a numeric status code (200) and its relative textual meaning (OK)
    - Some other common status codes are
      - 301 Moved Permanently, the requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI
      - 302 Found, the resource is temporarily under another URI
      - 403 Forbidden, the client does not have enough privileges and the server refuses to fulfill the request
      - 404 Not Found, the server cannot find a resource matching the request
      - 500 Internal Server Error, the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request
