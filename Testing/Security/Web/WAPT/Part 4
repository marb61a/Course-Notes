Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
HTTP Protocol Basics (Cont)
  - The Accept header is used by a browser to specify which document type is expected to be returned as a result of a request
  - The Accept-Encoding is similar to Accept, but it restricts the content codings that are acceptable in the response
    - Content codings are mainly used to allow a document to be compressed or transformed
      - This will be done without losing the identity of the media type and without loss of information
  - If using HTTP 1.1 you can keep a connection to the web server open for an unspecified amount of time
    - This will be done by adding the value "keep-alive" to the connection key
    - This indicates that all requests to the web server will continue to be sent through this connection 
      - Without initiating a new connection every time 
  - In response to the HTTP Request, the web server will respond with the requested resource preceded by some new headers
    - These new headers  will be used by the browser to interpret the content contained in the Response content.
  - The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line
    - This consists of the protocol version (HTTP 1.1) 
    - Followed by a numeric status code (200) and its relative textual meaning (OK)
    - Some other common status codes are
      - 301 Moved Permanently, the requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI
      - 302 Found, the resource is temporarily under another URI
      - 403 Forbidden, the client does not have enough privileges and the server refuses to fulfill the request
      - 404 Not Found, the server cannot find a resource matching the request
      - 500 Internal Server Error, the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request
  - The Cache headers allow the Browser and the Server to agree about caching rules
    - Cached contents save bandwidth because they prevent a browser from re-requesting unchanged contents
      - This is when the same resoource is to be used
  - Content-Type lets the client know how to interpret the body of the message
  - Content-Encoding extends Content-Type
    - Often you will see some type of compression eg GZip
  - The Server header displays the Web Server banner
    - The most common servers are IIS and Apache
    - Google uses a custom webserver banner: gws which is an acronym for Google Web Server
  - Content-Length indicates the length, in bytes, of the message body
  - Page Content is the actual content of the requested resource
    - The content can be an HTML page, a document, or even a binary file
    - The type of the content is contained in the Content-type header
  - More information is available in RFC 2616
  - The best way to learn more is to try messing around in the browser
    - There are notes about using the broswer for testing purposes available at
      - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/tree/master/Testing/Compendium Dev/Technical Web Testing 101
  - HTTP content like every clear-text protocol, can be easily intercepted by an attacker on the way to its destination
    - HTTP does not provide strong authentication between the two communicating parties
  - HTTP Secure (HTTPS) or HTTP over SSL/TLS is a method to run HTTP over SSL/TLS, a cryptographic protocol
    - This layering technique provides confidentiality, integrity protection and authentication to the HTTP protocol
  - HTTPS does not protect against web application flaws
    - This means that attacks against an application will happen regardless of SSL/TLS
    - The extra encryption layer just protects data exchanged between the client and the server
  - Understanding how HTTP and web applications work is fundamental to mount both stealthy and effective attacks

Encoding 
  - Information encoding is a critical component of  information technology
    - Its main function is to represent the low-level mapping of the information being handled
    - The encoding process is usually invisible to end users
    - It happens each time an application needs to elaborate on data
  - Understanding the various web encoding shcemes can be advantageous during the detection and exploitation of a vulnerability
  - Internet users request billions of pages via their browsers daily
    - The content of all of these pages are displayed accoring to a character set
      - Simply put a character set contains a set of characters
      - They represent the set of all symbols that the end user can display in their browser window
      - To use the proper terminology a charset consists of pairs of symbols and code points 
        - The symbol is what the user reads, as it is seen on the screen
        - The code point is a numeric index, used to distinguish, unambiguously, the symbol within the charset
      -  A symbol can be shown only if it exists in the charset
        - Some examples of character sets are ASCII, Unicode, Latin-1 etc
      - The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) charset contains a small set of symbols
        - Originally it was 128 only, but now it is usually defined with its extended version for a total of 255
        - The complete table can be found at -- http://www.asciitable.com/
      - Unicode (Universal Character Set) is the character encoding standard created to allow global computer use
        - This can of course be in any language
        - Character encoding (or simply encoding) is the representation, in bytes, of the symbols of a charset
