                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 5


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Encoding (Cont)
  - Character References                  Rule                                        Encode Character
    - Named Entity                      &+named character references+;                &lt;
    - Numeric Decimal                   &+#+D+; D = a decimal number                  &#60;
    - Numeric Hexadecimal               &+#x+H+; H = A case insensitve hex number     &#x3c; &#X3C;
  - Although the primary purpose of HTML entities is not really to be a security feature however, its use can limit most client side attacks 
  - RFC 3986 states that URLs sent over the Internet must contain characters in the range of the US-ASCII code character set
    - If the URL contains unsafe characters they must be encoded
    - This encoding is important because it limits the characters to be used in a URL to a subset of specific characters
      - Unreserved Characters -- [a-zA-z] [0-9]  [- . _ ~] 
      - Reserved characters that have a special purpose -- â€¢ : / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & " ( )  * + , ;  =  % 
  - Other characters are encoded by the use of a percent char (%) plus two hexadecimal digits
    - Reserved chars must be encoded when they have no special role inside the URL, below is a list of common characters
    - Character         Purpose in URI                    Encoding
      #                 Separate Anchors                  %23
      ?                 Separate query string             %3F
      &                 Separate query elements           %24
      +                 Indicates a space                 %2B
  - When you visit a site, URL-encoding is performed automatically by your browser
  - Although it appears to be a security feature, URL-encoding is not
    - It is only a method used to send data across the Internet but, it can lower the attack surface in some instances and increase it in others
    - Usually, web browsers or other client-side components perform encoding and server-side script engine will do the decoding
  - Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding schema used to convert binary files and send them over Internet
    - HTML allows for including some resources using Base64 encoding
    - One example is including an image that has had its binary converted to Base64
    - The Base64 encoding scheme is composed of [0-9][a-zA-Z] and the + and / characters to give it 64
    - Different implementations however, may use other values for the latest two characters and the one used for padding (=)
  - This is not all encoding schemes, remember that any web designer or developer could easily create their own encoding schema

Same Origin 
  - One of the most important and critical points of web application security is same origin policy
    - This policy prevents a script or a document from getting or setting properties of another document that comes from a different origin
  - CSS stylesheets, images and scripts are loaded by the browser without consulting the policy
  - Same Origin Policy (SOP) is consulted when cross-site HTTP requests are initiated from within client side scripts
  - The origin is defined by the values of three fields
    - The protocol, the host and the port
    - HTTPS is different from HTTP so https://abc.com is different from http://abc.com because the protocol is different
    - https://abc.com is different from https://new.abc.com because the host is different
  - The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left
    - https://abc.com
    - com is the top-level domain (TLD)
