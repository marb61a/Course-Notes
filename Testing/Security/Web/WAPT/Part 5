                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 5


Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications (Cont)
Encoding (Cont)
  - Character References                  Rule                                        Encode Character
    - Named Entity                      &+named character references+;                &lt;
    - Numeric Decimal                   &+#+D+; D = a decimal number                  &#60;
    - Numeric Hexadecimal               &+#x+H+; H = A case insensitve hex number     &#x3c; &#X3C;
  - Although the primary purpose of HTML entities is not really to be a security feature however, its use can limit most client side attacks 
  - RFC 3986 states that URLs sent over the Internet must contain characters in the range of the US-ASCII code character set
    - If the URL contains unsafe characters they must be encoded
    - This encoding is important because it limits the characters to be used in a URL to a subset of specific characters
      - Unreserved Characters -- [a-zA-z] [0-9]  [- . _ ~] 
      - Reserved characters that have a special purpose -- â€¢ : / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & " ( )  * + , ;  =  % 
  - Other characters are encoded by the use of a percent char (%) plus two hexadecimal digits
    - Reserved chars must be encoded when they have no special role inside the URL, below is a list of common characters
    - Character         Purpose in URI                    Encoding
      #                 Separate Anchors                  %23
      ?                 Separate query string             %3F
      &                 Separate query elements           %24
      +                 Indicates a space                 %2B
  - When you visit a site, URL-encoding is performed automatically by your browser
  - Although it appears to be a security feature, URL-encoding is not
