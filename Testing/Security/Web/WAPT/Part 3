                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 3


1.3 Reporting (Cont)
  - Vulnerability Report (Cont)
    - For each vulnerability found there should be a schema containing
      - Name of vulnerability containing description, impact, classification if available and ID if found elsewhere
      - Exploit Proof of Concept - Containing code from the exploit and screenshots taken
      - Affected Targets -- This will contain a list of the assets and which vulnerabilities have affected them
      - Where there is one vulnerability affecting multiple targets there will need to be proof of concept for each
    - If the vulnerability is in common off-the-shelf software, you should include its description from NIST or OSVDB
    - Is is good to add further explanation when the description sounds meaningless
      - The description should always be relevant to the client environment
        - It must provide clear information on the specific situation from the tests
    - It is a good idea to also add an impact value to a vulnerability, this will use
      - Exploit difficulty, whether it was difficult or relatively easy
      - Affect Systems, which would be judged by the asset value
      - How much exposure does the vulnerabilty need, is it remote or local or need elevated priviliges
      - Availability of exploits eg Metasploit modules
    - The OWASP Top 10 already assigns an impact to each risk so make it meaningful for each client by adjusting values
      - This should reflect the value an affected asset has in a business
    - A vulnerability ID is important to your client in order that they may gather more information 
      - Mitre CVE-ID’s are “unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities”
      - Standard practice to be followed is for known vulnerabilities you should include the corresponding ID 
        - This should be from at least Mitre CVE and OSVDB, including a link to their page
  - The Exploitation proof should not be too long
    - It is intended for your audience to understand how the exploitation was carried out
      - This is to help the devlopment team reproduce the exploit
    - When handing over proof include snapshots and available exploit payloads
      - Exploit payloads can include HTTP request and response headers in the case of web application testing
      - Where possible only include the vulnerable parameter, the HTTP method and the payload
      - Only add the full headers if exploit reproduction depends on them
  - Try to keep redundant information at a minimum
    - However do keep in mind that further explanation maybe needed if existing explanation is unclear
  - If vulnerabilities are heterogeneous, or the number of targets in scope is little
    - Then the information needed can be arranged on a per target basis
    - You can include a couple of graphs to highlight the types of vulnerabilities found on the single target
      - If using colours to show impact levels then this must be used throughout the report
  - The Remediation report is the place where the developers in charge of fixing the vulnerabilities are addressed
    - These are the vulnerabilities from the Vulnerability report that you have shown to be exploitable
    - This is where the difference between a professional pen tester and a hacker comes to ligh
      - Professional pen testers will help a client find the right solution to their issues
    - There are 2 different time horizons in the remediation report
      - Short Term and Long Term
      - In the short term you want the remediation team to address the most important vulnerabilities as soon as possible. 
        - You may need to suggest an emergency number to be provided by the client
          - This is for the possibility that vulnerabilities are found that put the clients vital assets at risk
        - Sometimes it takes weeks or months from the beginning of the tests to the release of the deliverables
        - You will want to persuade the client to address these high-impact issues as soon as possible
      - Long term action should also be suggested to the client such as
        - Implementation of SSDLC (Secure Software Development Lifecycle) 
        - Usage of security checks early in both business and development processes
        - Using different platforms, versions or frameworks
        - Long-term actions will bring benefits in the long run
          - These are unlikely to be accomplished in 6 - 12 months
          - There will also need to be a large investment of time and money
    - A testers job is to increase client security no just exploit their vulnerabilities
      - Providing suggestions on how to remediate common vulnerabilities is usually pretty trivial
      - If the vulnerability that was exploited is in a publicly available web application
        - Then just add references to remediations such as hotfixes, workarounds, patches or upgrades
        - You usually find all you need within vulnerability databases or in the official security advisories
      - If the application is custom-coded, you will have to suggest patches to the code 
        - Or else solutions according to the type of vulnerability and the web application environment
      - How information is arranged in the remediation report should reflect the approach used in the vulnerability report
        - There will have to be a prioritisation in the remediation plan 
        - This will be according to the impact level that was assigned and stuck with in the vulnerability report
        - The first issues on any list should be the most important.



Module 2 : Introduction to Web Applications
HTTP Protocol Basics
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basic protocol used for web browsing
  - It is the client-server protocol used to transfer web pages and web application data
    - The client is usually a web browser that starts a connection to a server 
  - During an HTTP communication, the client and the server exchange messages
    - The client sends a requests to the server and gets back responses
