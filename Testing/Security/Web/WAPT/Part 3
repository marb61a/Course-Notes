                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 3


1.3 Reporting (Cont)
  - Vulnerability Report (Cont)
    - For each vulnerability found there should be a schema containing
      - Name of vulnerability containing description, impact, classification if available and ID if found elsewhere
      - Exploit Proof of Concept - Containing code from the exploit and screenshots taken
      - Affected Targets -- This will contain a list of the assets and which vulnerabilities have affected them
      - Where there is one vulnerability affecting multiple targets there will need to be proof of concept for each
    - If the vulnerability is in common off-the-shelf software, you should include its description from NIST or OSVDB
    - Is is good to add further explanation when the description sounds meaningless
      - The description should always be relevant to the client environment
        - It must provide clear information on the specific situation from the tests
    - It is a good idea to also add an impact value to a vulnerability, this will use
      - Exploit difficulty, whether it was difficult or relatively easy
      - Affect Systems, which would be judged by the asset value
      - How much exposure does the vulnerabilty need, is it remote or local or need elevated priviliges
      - Availability of exploits eg Metasploit modules
    - The OWASP Top 10 already assigns an impact to each risk so make it meaningful for each client by adjusting values
      - This should reflect the value an affected asset has in a business
    - A vulnerability ID is important to your client in order that they may gather more information 
      - Mitre CVE-ID’s are “unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities”
      - Standard practice to be followed is for known vulnerabilities you should include the corresponding ID 
        - This should be from at least Mitre CVE and OSVDB, including a link to their page
  - The Exploitation proof should not be too long
