                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 9


Module 3 : Information Gathering (Cont)
Infrastructure (Cont)
  - Cookies are also an interesting resource that may reveal useful information in this phase
    - Each technology has its default cookies names therefore, we can potentially guess it by inspecting the cookie header
      -  PHP -> PHPSESSID=XXXXX 
      - .NET -> ASPSSESSIONIDYYYY=XXXXX 
      - JAVA -> JSESSION=XXXXX 
  - There may be many different result outputs depending on the service running on the machine, the version, Operating System etc
  - Another tool that may prove to be useful is WhatWeb
    - This is a command line tool that can be used to recognize website technologies
    - Pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux already have it installed by default
    - To start using the too simply type the following in the terminal -> whatweb -h 
    - It can be added to an environment by cloning the Github repo using
      - git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb.git
    - The tool itself is very easy to use
      - You just need to type the name of the tool followed by the address (IP or URL) of our target and hit enter
      - You can specify multiple targets in the command or even IP ranges
      - There are  options that allow us to specify different user agents, HTTP basic authentication credentials, cookies, proxy and more
      - Also worth noting is that the tool automatically follows redirections
      - If you desire a more readable output, just use the -v option
  - Another very useful tool that can be used directly from our web browser is called wappalyzer 
    - It is a Web Browser plugin based tool that works both on Firefox and Chrome

Fingerprinting Frameworks and Applications 
  - Once a list of subdomains has been obtained then the appropriate techniques can be applied
    - Essentially we start looking at the webpages running on each of the subdomains that were found
  - Common applications are those pieces of software that are available online for anyone to use 
    - There is an acronym to describe these COTS - Common off the shelf
  - They can be either open source or commercial
    - Access to the source code is what makes them interesting for analysis
  - There may be an opportunity to read both the application logic and the security controls implemented
    - This gives a big advantage over custom in-house applications where the logic needs to be guessed to certain degree
  -

Fingerprinting Custom Applications 
  -

Enumerating Resources 
  -

Information Disclosure Through Misconfiguration 
  -

Google Hacking
