                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 9


Fingerprinting Frameworks and Applications 
  - Once a list of subdomains has been obtained then the appropriate techniques can be applied
    - Essentially we start looking at the webpages running on each of the subdomains that were found
  - Common applications are those pieces of software that are available online for anyone to use 
    - There is an acronym to describe these COTS - Common off the shelf
  - They can be either open source or commercial
    - Access to the source code is what makes them interesting for analysis
  - There may be an opportunity to read both the application logic and the security controls implemented
    - This gives a big advantage over custom in-house applications where the logic needs to be guessed to certain degree
