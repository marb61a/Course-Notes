Module 1 : Penetration Testing Process
1.1 Pre-engagement
  - A Penetration test is a complex, cyclical process of both identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a system
  - The ultimate goal of any penetration test is to identify and assess a client organisationâ€™s risk of exposure
  - There is not a unified industry standard for performing Penetration tests
    - There have been efforts by both organisations and the open source community to establish some standards
    - These have been to standardise the methodology and operations before, during and after the pen testing
  - During the pre-engagement phase the rules of engagement need to be agreed including by both the tester and the client
    - The documents in which all of these agreements are formalized (in writing) and signed is called the Rules of Engagement.
      - This can be can be one or more documents with the objective to define the following items
      - The goal and scope of the engagement
        - The goal and scope mean 2 separate things during a pen test
        - The goal of a penetration test is the very reason the client is hiring a tester
