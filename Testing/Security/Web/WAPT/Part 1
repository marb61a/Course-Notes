                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 1

Module 1 : Penetration Testing Process
1.1 Pre-engagement
  - A Penetration test is a complex, cyclical process of both identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a system
  - The ultimate goal of any penetration test is to identify and assess a client organisationâ€™s risk of exposure
  - There is not a unified industry standard for performing Penetration tests
    - There have been efforts by both organisations and the open source community to establish some standards
    - These have been to standardise the methodology and operations before, during and after the pen testing
  - During the pre-engagement phase the rules of engagement need to be agreed including by both the tester and the client
    - The documents in which all of these agreements are formalized (in writing) and signed is called the Rules of Engagement.
      - This can be can be one or more documents with the objective to define the following items
      - The goal and scope of the engagement
        - The goal and scope mean 2 separate things during a pen test
        - The goal of a penetration test is the very reason the client is hiring a tester
          - This question should be asked of a client
          - This is because different answers shape the pre-engagment phase differently
            - For example a pen test after a breach will be different to one that is ensuring compliance
          - Clients usually will not know what they want so discussing their goals will help with the scope of the test
        - The Scope of Engagement is exactly what you will have to (or be allowed to) test
          - This defines the boundaries of your test
          - This is very important legally as testing beyond the scope can lead to legal problems
            - This includes criminal charges for breaking the rules of engagement
          - Scope can be defined both logically and physically
            - Logical scope is, for example, an entire department within the organization
              - This boundaries should be paid attention to because they are poorly defined
                - This may cause interpretation issues as the client may consider something outside scope that the tester doesn't
            - Physical scope is simply IP addresses, Servers, Domains etc and are well defined
          - Scope in a web application penetration test is often defined in terms of domains
            - Often a client will want a pen test against a sub-domain
              - It is important to know which sub-domains are included
          - The timetable of a penetration test is the same that you would define for any other project
            - It may get a bit more complicated though
            - There are different tools available such as Time Tracking Tables or GANTT charts
              - Tables are recommended due to being able to convery information quickly and easily
            - There are a couple of things to remember
              - Timing is usually suggested by and agreed upon with the client 
              - Times can change in the test depending on information uncovered
          - 
      - The timeline and milestones
      - The liabilities and\or responsibilities including
        - Liabilities
          - Sensitive data is accessed out-of-scope
          - Data is accidentally removed
          - Tester accidentally causes unavailability of services
          - There is another catastrophic event with an impact on the organization
        - Responsibilities
          - Keeping the client informed and up to date during your pentest
          - Keeping reports and collected data in a safe place
          - Following a code of ethics
          - Nondisclosure of any information
      - The allowed techniques
      - The deliverables and expectations
      - The statement of work
