                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 1

Module 1 : Penetration Testing Process
1.1 Pre-engagement
  - A Penetration test is a complex, cyclical process of both identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a system
  - The ultimate goal of any penetration test is to identify and assess a client organisation’s risk of exposure
  - There is not a unified industry standard for performing Penetration tests
    - There have been efforts by both organisations and the open source community to establish some standards
    - These have been to standardise the methodology and operations before, during and after the pen testing
  - During the pre-engagement phase the rules of engagement need to be agreed including by both the tester and the client
    - The documents in which all of these agreements are formalized (in writing) and signed is called the Rules of Engagement.
      - This can be can be one or more documents with the objective to define the following items
      - The goal and scope of the engagement
        - The goal and scope mean 2 separate things during a pen test
        - The goal of a penetration test is the very reason the client is hiring a tester
          - This question should be asked of a client
          - This is because different answers shape the pre-engagment phase differently
            - For example a pen test after a breach will be different to one that is ensuring compliance
          - Clients usually will not know what they want so discussing their goals will help with the scope of the test
        - The Scope of Engagement is exactly what you will have to (or be allowed to) test
          - This defines the boundaries of your test
          - This is very important legally as testing beyond the scope can lead to legal problems
            - This includes criminal charges for breaking the rules of engagement
          - Scope can be defined both logically and physically
            - Logical scope is, for example, an entire department within the organization
              - This boundaries should be paid attention to because they are poorly defined
                - This may cause interpretation issues as the client may consider something outside scope that the tester doesn't
            - Physical scope is simply IP addresses, Servers, Domains etc and are well defined
          - Scope in a web application penetration test is often defined in terms of domains
            - Often a client will want a pen test against a sub-domain
              - It is important to know which sub-domains are included
      - The timeline and milestones
        - The timetable of a penetration test is the same that you would define for any other project
          - It may get a bit more complicated though
          - There are different tools available such as Time Tracking Tables or GANTT charts
            - Tables are recommended due to being able to convery information quickly and easily
          - There are a couple of things to remember
            - Timing is usually suggested by and agreed upon with the client 
            - Times can change in the test depending on information uncovered
          - If creating a timetable it should contain
            - Both a start and end in Date-Time format
            - The targets of the test
            - The step in the process that a particular item corresponds to
            - Any source IP addresses
            - How critical is the test
              - The criticality of a test determines whether the tests being conducted pose a risk
                - This can be a denial-of-service, system outage or data loss to the client
              - Criticality definitions should be developed with the client
              - Another item that should be developed is emergency steps to undertake 
                - This can be invaluable if things go badly for the client’s systems
              - Having the criticality level explicit in the timetable will help the client
                - To know exactly when someone in the organization should be available 
      - The liabilities and\or responsibilities including
        - Liabilities
          - Sensitive data is accessed out-of-scope
          - Data is accidentally removed
          - Tester accidentally causes unavailability of services
          - There is another catastrophic event with an impact on the organization
          - These should be dealt with by an attorney
        - Responsibilities
          - Responsibilities are pretty much simple care and ethics
          - Keeping the client informed and up to date during your pentest
          - Keeping reports and collected data in a safe place
          - Following a code of ethics
          - Nondisclosure of any information
        - A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is part of any engagement
          - Basically, the penetration tester guarantees, in writing that any information will not be disclosed to a 3rd party
          - This includes discovered vulnerabilities, exploits used or developed or any information related to the organization
      - The allowed techniques
      - The deliverables and expectations
      - The statement of work
