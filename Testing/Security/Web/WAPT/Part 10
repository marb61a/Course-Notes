                    Web Application Penetration Testing
                    Course Notes Part 10


Fingerprinting Frameworks and Applications 
  - Once a list of subdomains has been obtained then the appropriate techniques can be applied
    - Essentially we start looking at the webpages running on each of the subdomains that were found
  - Common applications are those pieces of software that are available online for anyone to use 
    - There is an acronym to describe these COTS - Common off the shelf
  - They can be either open source or commercial
    - Access to the source code is what makes them interesting for analysis
  - There may be an opportunity to read both the application logic and the security controls implemented
    - This gives a big advantage over custom in-house applications where the logic needs to be guessed to certain degree
  -

Fingerprinting Custom Applications 
  - When not in front of a commonly available application, you have to go through an initial overview of the application logic
    - This example has an in-house application customised for the organisation being tested
    - The inner logic is unknown to us but can be reverse engineered with a careful analysis of its behavior

Enumerating Resources

Relevant Information Through Misconfigurations
  - Sometimes the best way to retrieve relevant information about our web applications is to look for potential mistakes in web server configuration
  - A quick and very common way to gather information, files, source code and misconfigurations is by looking for open directory listings
    - These directories have been configured to show a list of the files and subdirectories in paths that we can access directly
    - 99% of the time, these directories have not been deliberately configured to show their content
      - They are just the result of a misconfiguration
    - Looking for directory listings is a task that anyone with a basic experience in scripting languages like Perl, Python etc can automate in few minutes
