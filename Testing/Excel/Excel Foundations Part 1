The Quick Access toolbar
  - Excel usually has 3 icons on the toolbar
  - The save button, undo and redo
  - There is a customise icon, which allows for users to add regularly used icons to the bar
  - Each has their own icons to add but things like print preview are popular
  - You can use the bar below the ribbon using the same named option

Tabs and Ribbons
  - Each tab has its own set of icons on the ribbon
  - These are then divided into groups
