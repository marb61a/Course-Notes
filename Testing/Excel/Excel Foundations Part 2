                    Section 3 -	Worksheets
Inserting And Editing Cell Contents
  - Clicking on a cell makes it active to be able to enter information
  - Using the tab key will move to the right
  - Cell content can be edited in the formula bar
  - By default text will default align to the left and numbers to the right
Editing Height & Width
  - Hovering on the dividing line between columns will give a special cursor
  - This will allow the user to expand or shrink a column by dragging
  - Double-Clicking on the same line will auto-fit on the content for the column
  - This can be used will groups of columns and rows
  - This can be used also with changing height of rows
Inserting and Deleting Columns etc
  - To delete a column you must highlight the entire column first
  - Once the column is highlighted use the delete option on the tool bar
  - The process for deleting rows is the same as for columns
  - Also inserting a column is the same as for delete but you use the insert option
  - Rows are always insert above you current row, columns are inserted to the left of current
  - You can use the right mouse click instead of the menu options
  - Using the right click allows for moving cells when deleting existing ones
Organising Sheets
  - Sheets by default are arranged in order eg Sheet1, Sheet2 etc
  - Double clicking allows for renaming
  - When naming sheets so not use special characters if possible
  - Sheets are added to the right of current
  - Sheets can be deleted with right click and then delete
  - Click the plus sign beside the sheets to add a new one
Hiding and Unhiding
  - Rows, Columns and sheets can be hidden in Excel
  - This can be helpful to hide unneeded information
  - Hiding a column is done by highlighting the column and right click and select hide
  - Unhiding can be done by lining the curson between columns and then dragging with the special cursor that appears
  - Again the procedure is the same for rows
  - Unhiding sheets will show a list of hidden sheets so you can select which to unhide

                    Section 4 -	Printing
Print Preview
  - It is important to use print preview to review your sheets prior to printing
Scale to fit
  - You may need to alter layout of columns to fit on to a page
  - You will need to change the width in the scale to fit setting
  - In the Page Layout tab you can adjust Height and Width settings
  - A good rule of thumb is to not go to below 70% as readability will be compromised
Editing Margins and Orientation
  - There are 2 types Portrait and Landscape
  - Landscape is wider but shorter, Portrait the opposite
  - Narrow margins are good if short on space
  - You can also have custom margins
Print Titles, Grids and Headings
  - Using Print Title setting will allow for column headings to be printed on each page
  - Without this the column titles will only be on page 1
  - You will need to select a row, this need not be the actual titles
Print One Sheet and Multiple sheets
  - Print settings are on the left hand side of the Print page
  - You can have many printers including to a pdf file
  - You can also print just the active sheets or the whole workbook
