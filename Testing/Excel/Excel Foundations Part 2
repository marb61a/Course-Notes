Print Preview
  - It is important to use print preview to review your sheets prior to printing
Scale to fit
  - You may need to alter layout of columns to fit on to a page
  - You will need to change the width in the scale to fit setting
  - In the Page Layout tab you can adjust Height and Width settings
  - A good rule of thumb is to not go to below 70% as readability will be compromised
Editing Margins and Orientation
  - There are 2 types Portrait and Landscape
  - Landscape is wider but shorter, Portrait the opposite
  - Narrow margins are good if short on space
  - You can also have custom margins
Print Titles, Grids and Headings
  - Using Print Title setting will allow for column headings to be printed on each page
  - Without this the column titles will only be on page 1
  - You will need to select a row, this need not be the actual titles
Print One Sheet and Multiple sheets
  - Print settings are on the left hand side of the Print page
  - You can have many printers including to a pdf file
  - You can also print just the active sheets or the whole workbook
  - You can also collate when printing multiple copies
