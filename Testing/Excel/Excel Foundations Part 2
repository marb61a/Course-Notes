  - To delete a column you must highlight the entire column first
  - Once the column is highlighted use the delete option on the tool bar
  - The process for deleting rows is the same as for columns
  - Also inserting a column is the same as for delete but you use the insert option
  - Rows are always insert above you current row, columns are inserted to the left of current

  - Click the plus sign beside the sheets to add a new one

  - This can be helpful to hide unneeded information
  - Hiding a column is done by highlighting the column and right click and select hide
  - Unhiding can be done by lining the curson between columns and then dragging with the special cursor that appears
