                              Formula
Operators
  - When using formulas in Excel you can use Operators
  - An operator is simply the math sign you use in a formula +, -, *, /, %
  - The very first item that goes into an Excel formula is the equals sign
  - You can use multiple cells eg =A2+A3+A4+A5
  - Changes to be made to the formula are made in the formula bar
  - Values update when using cell references rather than hard cell values
  - You will need to use brackets to ensure that operator precedence does not affect values

Sum
  - The SUM function replaces using the + sign
  - =A2+A3+A4+A5 becomes =SUM(A2:A5)
  - SUM can be used both horizontally and vertically
