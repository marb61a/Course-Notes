                    Excel Analyzing Data Part 1
                    Course Notes


                    Working With Lists
Applying A Sort
  - A list will contain headings and then appropriate data underneath
  - To be able to sort data you will need to be in the data tab
  - The first step is to ensure that the data is seen as one range
    - A keyboard shortcut for selecting all is CTRL-A
  - Sorting A-Z will apply a lexicographically proper sort
  - Sorting Z-A will sort in reverse order
  - To sort by more than 1 column at a time you will click the sort button
  - This will open a popup window which allows adding or removing sort levels
  - Using the up arrow will swap sorting orders

Applying A Filter
  - Another way of examining data is to use a filter
  - Again the data will need to be seen as a range
  - In the data tab there is a filter button
  - This will bring up a set of drop down filters on each of the column headers
  - When selected this will return the data that matches the filter
  - To remove a filter you can click on the drop down arrow and select clear filter
  - You can also apply more than 1 filter
  - On the left of the page rows will be coloured blue if there is a filter on
  - Also on the main menu the clear, reapply and advanced options are available
  - There is also an image of a funnel at the bottom of the page to suggest filtering
  - To turn off the drop down arrows then simply turn off the funnel  
  
Flash Fill
  - Flash Fill can be used to divide information eg a complete name into title, first and last names
  - In the first column you wish to flash fill you will type the field you want filled
    - In the name example Mr or Mrs etc
  - In the home tab go to the fill button, click and select flash fill
  - The procedure is the same for the next fields
  - There is a box which appears which allows for undoing fill 
  
Text To Column
  - This can help where Flash Fill does not work
  - One example is to split emails
  - In the data tab select the Text to Columns option
  - This will bring up the Text to Columns wizard
  - The best description of data is nearly always delimited
  - There are a number of options for delimiting data eg comma
