                    Tables                    
Creating A Table
  - Tables tend to be created from a list of data
  - On the home tab there is a format as table option
    - There are 3 different types of format available light, medium and dark
    - This is across multiple colour schemes
    - This will automatically apply a table to the data range
    - This will also make a design tab available for table tools
      - You need to be in the table for this to work otherwise you will not see table tools option
  - Another way to add a table structure is to use the insert table on the insert tab
  - Both methods end up with the same result

Table Options And Design
  - Inside the Design tab while inside a table
  - At the left of the tab is a place to name the table
  - It is suggested to use tbl at the start of a name to show it is a table
  - The table style options group show what is highlighted on screen eg banded rows

Entering Data
  - When you have converted a range to a table entering data is different then just adding to a range
  - This is because you will need to resize a table
  - In the design tab first section there is a resize table option
  - In the last cell hitting the tab key will add an extra row automatically
  - There is also an option to use a tag in the bottom right corner you can manually resize the table
  
Slicers
  - Again in the table tools design tab there is the insert slicer option
  - The slicer is a more visual type of filter
  - You must be in the table before clicking insert slicer
  - Adding a slicer will create a slicer window which display the slices
  - Clicking on the slices will filter data from the main table to show associated
  - Using the Slicer makes the table tools disappear to be replaced by slicer tools
  - There can be more than 1 slicer on at a time
  - Clicking on the red x will remove the slicer
  
Summarising With A Pivot Table
  - Once a range has been converted to a table it will be recognised by that name
  - In the table tools design tab there is the Summarize With Pivot Table option
  - Clicking is the same as going into the insert tab and adding a pivot table
  - The only difference is that here the created table is automatically taken as the value to be used 

Removing Duplicates
  - In the table tools design tab there is the Remove Duplicates Option
  - This will automatically delete duplicates
  - The user can set which values to set which values have to be the same to be deleted
  - By default a record will have to match all column criteria

Converting A Range To A Table
  - In the table tools design tab there is the Convert To Range option
  - Reverting changes is very important in Excel
  - Be careful of knockon effects from removing a table eg broken formulas from now non existing table
