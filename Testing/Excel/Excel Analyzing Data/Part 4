Creating A Table
  - Tables tend to be created from a list of data
  - On the home tab there is a format as table option
    - There are 3 different types of format available light, medium and dark
    - This is across multiple colour schemes
    - This will automatically apply a table to the data range
    - This will also make a design tab available for table tools
      - You need to be in the table for this to work otherwise you will not see table tools option
  - Another way to add a table structure is to use the insert table on the insert tab
  - Both methods end up with the same result

Table Options And Design
  - Inside the Design tab while inside a table
  - At the left of the tab is a place to name the table
  - It is suggested to use tbl at the start of a name to show it is a table
  - The table style options group show what is highlighted on screen eg banded rows
