Add A Chart Element
  - Chart elements are items such as titles, legends, labels etc
  - After going into the design tab of the chart tools the first item on the ribbon is Add Chart Elements
  - Clicking will show a list of elements which can be added to a chart
  - Elements turned on are being used already
  - Primary Title vertical or Horizontal allows for adding custom title
  - When using title Central Overlay means it sits in front of the chart
  - Data callout can be poor for visibility if there are a lot of columns
  - This can be improved by selecting a single series to be called out
    - Also making the chart larger will help show callouts and data clearer
  - Data labels can be dragged along the columns they are called out on
    - This can also make data points and columns clearer
  - To remove labels, go to the Add Chart Elements -> Labels -> none
  - Selecting more options in the Labels option brings up the Format Data Labels panel
    - This allows the user to show certain things on a label
    - Options include Value, Series Name, Category Name and Value from Cells
    - There is also options to change both size and alignment of a label
    - Users can also change label angles to avoid overlapping
  - A lot of the time labels will not be applied to all data
    - Instead certain series within data will be labelled
  - When finished simply close the Format Data Labels panel
  - Users can also choose to show both data table and chart at the same time
  - Chart legend can be on or off, if on it can be set in various places 

Chart Styles
  - In the Design Tab of the Chart Tools
  - There are a range of chart styles that users can choose from
  - Normally this will affect the color scheme
  - There can also be certain affects added eg gradient colour etc
  - Each style can also have different colour schemes
  
Adding Ranges To A Chart
  - You can use insert chart with partial ranges eg 6 months instead of a year
  - Having data side by side makes things easy but this will not always be the case
  - Selecting different column can be done by highlighting the heading column
    - It is important that the first cell which is usuall empty is selected
    - Then holding down the CTRL key select each column
