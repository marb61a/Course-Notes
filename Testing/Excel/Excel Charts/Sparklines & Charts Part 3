Add A Chart Element
  - Chart elements are items such as titles, legends, labels etc
  - After going into the design tab of the chart tools the first item on the ribbon is Add Chart Elements
  - Clicking will show a list of elements which can be added to a chart
  - Elements turned on are being used already
  - Primary Title vertical or Horizontal allows for adding custom title
  - When using title Central Overlay means it sits in front of the chart
  - Data callout can be poor for visibility if there are a lot of columns
  - This can be improved by selecting a single series to be called out
    - Also making the chart larger will help show callouts and data clearer
  - Data labels can be dragged along the columns they are called out on
    - This can also make data points and columns clearer
  - To remove labels, go to the Add Chart Elements -> Labels -> none
  - Selecting more options in the Labels option brings up the Format Data Labels panel
