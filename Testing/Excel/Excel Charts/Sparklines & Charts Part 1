Insert A Sparkline
  - On the Insert tab is the sparklines group
  - There are 3 types of Sparkline, Line, Column and Win/Loss
  - Lines are mini-charts that are placed into a single cell
  - Each line will represent a row within a selection which shows a trend line
  
Edit A Sparkline
  - When creating sparklines if you use drag to fill other rows it will see these as a single group
  - This means that you will not be able edit a single sparkline
  - In the Sparkline Tools design tab there are multipl colour and format options for sparklines
  - If you change colour of 1 line then they all change due to grouping
  - There is also the option to ungroup

Group And Ungroup Sparklines
  - Because drag was used to create the sparkline they belong to one group
  - On the design tab there is an entire group section
  - If you will to change 1 sparkline then select ungroup
  - To check they are ungrouped select a sparkline and if the others are not selected then they are ungrouped
  
Sparkline Axis Options
  - In the sparklines design tab there is an axis option in the group section
  - This has both axis options and the ability to change options
  - To use the same values on each sparkline in a group in the axis option select same for all sparklines
  - This can be set for both minimum and maximum
  - This will automatically set for all by default
  - You can set plotting to go from right to left, this is a mirror image of right to left

Delete A Sparkline
  - A sparkline goes into the backgroud of a cell
  - This means that content could still be typed in
  - Simply deleting will not work
  - Highlight the cell, go into the design tab and select clear
  - You can clear both a single cell and a group
