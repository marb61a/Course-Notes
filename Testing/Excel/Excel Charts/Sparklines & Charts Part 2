  - Histogram which is a column chart that shows frequency data
  - Pareto which is a sorted histogram chart
    - This contains both descending chart columns and a line representing cumulative total percentage
  - Box And Whisker chart which shows data distribution into quartiles
    - This highlights the mean and outliers
    - There maybe lines extending vertically from the boxes which are called whiskers
    - These are most often used in statistical analysis
  - Sunburst charts are most suited to diplaying hierarchical data
    - Each level of the hierarchy is represented by a ring or circle
    - The innermost circle is the top of the hierarchy
    - With no hierarchical data they look like doughnut charts
