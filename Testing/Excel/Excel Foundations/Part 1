  - Use the formula bar for editing formulas rather then entering a cell to edit
Cut, Copy And Paste

Autofill With Text
  - After filling a cell with content and leaving clicking back on the cell generates a tool in the bottom left
  - This is known as the autofill tool
  - Hovering on the box causes the cursor to become a blank x
  - Dragging this down will continue a series eg months
  - It will not matter where you start on the months eg Jan or June
  - There are several different lists built in to Excel
  - It is not just items such as weekdays or months but numbers too
  - Any word that is not part of a list will just be copied into a new cell
  - To just copy the same value hold ctrl on the autofill and a smaller black cross will appear
  - Then you can just drag down as far as you would like the term to go
Autofill With Numbers
  - By default autofill will just repeat numbers
  - To increment by 1, hold ctrl on autofill and drag down
  - Excel will learn a sequence and will continue it
  - For example 5, 10, 15 and drag will lead to the sequence of incrementing by 5 as long as you want to drag
Autofill With Dates
  - Autofill increments the date by 1 automatically
  - Dragging upwards will go backwards through dates
  - This is through of dragging left also, going right or down will go forward
