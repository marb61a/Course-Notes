                    Defining And Auditing Formula
Absolute And Relative Referencing
  - Autofill uses relative referencing
  - This changes a formula relative to where you are moving to eg column C to D
  - The opposite of relative referencing is absolute referencing
  - In this case the cell in a formula does not change when using autofill
  - You can use F4 to apply absolute referencing
  - This places a $ in front of column and row eg B3 becomes $B$3
  - The $ value makes a value an absolute value
  - Using $ will make autofill work correctly
  - You can have both the cell and the column absolute or relative

Name Manager
  - In the formulas tab and defined names grouping there is a name manager button
  - This is where you can create, edit, find etc names that were used in the workbook
  - You can name a cell that would be absolute
  - To assign a name, click in a cell and add a name to the name box
  - There should be no spaces in a name
  - Also it is recommended to use lowercase
  - After entering the name hit return and click away,upon return cell will be named
  - To use a named cell simply start a formula eg =A1*dollar
  - Named cells are automatically absolute
