If Statements                    
Simple If Statement
  - This tests to see if a condition is met
  - To use go to the forumlas tab
  - Then select insert formula and begin typing if into the box that appears
  - This will then show a list of possible items, select IF and hit return
  - The syntax looks like =IF()
  - There will be a box that appears to enter the condition to be tested and the values to be returned
  - These will be different values depending on evaluation being true or false
  - The condition to be tested is called the logical test
  - This can be used with autofill
  - Instead of using inbuilt functions you can also type in IF statements by hand

  - There are cases where there is not a simple true or false answer
  - You may need to run through a couple of condition checks
  - This is where using a nested if statement comes
