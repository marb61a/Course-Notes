                    Course Notes

                    Functions
If Statements                    
Simple If Statement
  - This tests to see if a condition is met
  - To use go to the forumlas tab
  - Then select insert formula and begin typing if into the box that appears
  - This will then show a list of possible items, select IF and hit return
  - The syntax looks like =IF()
  - There will be a box that appears to enter the condition to be tested and the values to be returned
  - These will be different values depending on evaluation being true or false
  - The condition to be tested is called the logical test
  - This can be used with autofill
  - Instead of using inbuilt functions you can also type in IF statements by hand

Nested If Statement
  - There are cases where there is not a simple true or false answer
  - You may need to run through a couple of condition checks
  - This is where using a nested if statement comes in
  - Example is where you have 3 grade marks
    - below 60 is a fail, above a pass, above 80 is a merit
    - This means that there are a couple of checks necessary due to 2 different outcomes above 60
  - The syntax is =if(condition, if(condition, false value))
  - In theory there can be as many nested statements as you like
  - Be sure that there are the correct amount of brackets
  - Excel will make the final bracket bold to standout

If AND Statement
  - You can join If statements together
  - This is done using AND
  - The logical test is that both conditions must be true for true to be returned
  - The syntax is =IF(AND(first_condition, second_condition), true_value, false_value)
  - If either is false then the false value will be rerurned
