                    Excel Formulas And Functions Part 6
                    Course Notes

                    More Functions
Database Functions
  - These are functions like SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN etc
  - They go and look at data using criteria to return values
  - One example is DSUM which calculates the sum of values in a list or DB
    - The syntax is =DSUM(db(range), field(column), criteria)
  - The same can be used for DCOUNT, DAVERAGE etc
  - There can be both numeric and alphanumeric count eg DCOUNT, DCOUNTA
  - DGET returns a single value where conditions are met

Text Functions
  - There are several Text function in Excel
  - UPPER() which changes everything in a cell to uppercase
  - LOWER() which changes everything in a cell to lowercase
  - PROPER() which changes the first letter of a word in Excel to uppercase and leaves the rest lower
  - TRIM() which gets rid of non needed space in a cell
  - LEFT() which can bring a specified number of characters from a cell value eg =LEFT(A10, 2) will bring back the first 2 digits
  - RIGHT() does the same as above but starts from the end
  - MID() will get values from the middle of the cell value, the syntax is slightly different
    - =MID(cell, chars_to_go_in, chars_to_bring_back)
  - Cells can be joined using &, + is for numbers

Indirect Function
  - This returns the reference specified by a text string
  - This can be used for example in a cell reference within a formula without affecting the formula itself
    - =INDIRECT(A10) will look at the reference in A10 not the value
  - Thic can be used to with a column and row number

3D References
  - This is used in building summary sheets
  - The syntax is =SUM(first_sheet:last_sheet!cell_reference)
  - You can also use autofill with this approach
