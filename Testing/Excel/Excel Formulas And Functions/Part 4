                    Functions
Lookup Functions                    
VLookup Same Sheet
  - When talking about lookup we are talking about finding and returning information
  - The V in this case stands for Vertical
  - There is also a Horizontal lookup which will be discussed
  - One example is membership numbers eg 101, 102 etc which will be vertical
  - It is important that the value being looked up is in the first column
  - If it is not, the lookup will not work and data will need to be rearranged
  - You can type the formula in directly or use the insert functionality
  - On the formulas tab there is the insert function option
  - Select VLOOKUP either by typing in the box or by using the drop-down list
  - This will bring up the function arguments dialogue box
  - This made of 4 segments
    - The lookup value which will hold the cell where you enter the value to be looked up
    - Table Array which is where is needs to go to find more information eg an entire able range
    - Column index number which will bring back a specific column eg money owed
      - You will need to have columns numbered 
    - Range Lookup which will take either true or false
      - False will mean needing to match an exact match to the lookup value
      - True will find the closest match
      - False will be used much more often than true
  - This will track changes eg change member number will show for that specific number
  - If the lookup value does not exist n/a will be returned

VLookup Involving 2 Sheets
  - The same rules on being the first column when looking for values applies
  - To add information to table array which is on a separate sheet
    - Click inside the Table Array box in the function arguments dialogue box
    - Then click on the sheet where the information needed resides
    - This will automatically add to the table array box
    - Then select the range of data needed
  - Column numbers will show preview information
    - If the column is a number it will show a number, a name will show a name etc
  - You can use multiple VLookup in different boxes on the same sheet
  
VLookup Involving 2 Workbooks
  - The easiest way to do this is to have both workbooks open
  - Depending on screen using the tile feature for displaying under Arrange All maybe helpful
  - It is similar to using 2 sheets but again side by side makes preparation easier
  - Again in the Table Array click in the box but then go to the second workbook and select a range
  - Even after closing the second workbook it will still work
  - In the formula bar you will see an address of the disk location of the second workbook
  
VLookup With Closest Match Option
  - This is using true in the range lookup option in the function arguments dialogue box
  - This can be used in a closest match example
  - True will look for the closest lowest match to a number
    - For example years worked if 10 and 15 are options and 13 is entered then 10 is the nearest

HLookup
  - VLookup is the norm as data is normally used vertically
  - There are occasions where horizontal needs to be used
  - You will need to use the HLOOKUP function
  - This is identical to the functionality offered to VLookup
  - The only difference is using rows instead of columns
  
Comparing 2 Options
  - VLookup is often used to compare 2 lists
  - This will show which numbers exist or don't on a list
  - You can use iferror with VLookup to replace n\a with text where values do not exist
