VLookup Same Sheet
  - When talking about lookup we are talking about finding and returning information
  - The V in this case stands for Vertical
  - There is also a Horizontal lookup which will be discussed
  - One example is membership numbers eg 101, 102 etc which will be vertical
  - It is important that the value being looked up is in the first column
  - If it is not, the lookup will not work and data will need to be rearranged
  - You can type the formula in directly or use the insert functionality
  - On the formulas tab there is the insert function option
  - Select VLOOKUP either by typing in the box or by using the drop-down list
  - This will bring up the function arguments dialogue box
  - This made of 4 segments
    - The lookup value which will hold the cell where you enter the value to be looked up
    - Table Array which is where is needs to go to find more information eg an entire able range
    - Column index number which will bring back a specific column eg money owed
      - You will need to have columns numbered 
    - Range Lookup which will take either true or false
      - False will mean needing to match an exact match to the lookup value
      - True will find the closest match
      - False will be used much more often than true
  - This will track changes eg change member number will show for that specific number
  - If the lookup value does not exist n/a will be returned
