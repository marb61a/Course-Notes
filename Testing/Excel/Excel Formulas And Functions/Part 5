                    Course Notes

                    More Functions
Quick Analysis Tool
  - If you would like to perform some operations on spreadsheet data eg a table you can highlight the table
  - After doing this the quick analysis tool box will appear in the bottom left
    - You can also use CTRL+Q to bring this up
  - This will allow you to quick use features like colour coding, charts, functions etc
  - Clicking on the box will bring up a box with set of tabs
  - Using color for example will apply a heat map using red and green

Countif and Sumif
  - This can count certain values from within a range
    - The formula is =COUNTIF(range, "criteria in inverted commas")
    - For example in a computers sold table =COUNTIF(A2:A15, "Laptop")
    - Criteria has to be an exact match but is not case sensitive
  - Sumif can be used similar to countif
  - To use the computers sold example again
    - =SUMIF(range, "Criteria", range_of_cells_to_be_summed)

Sumifs And Count Ifs And AverageIfs
  - This for a set of data that has more than 1 criteria
  - This can be used where values lie between boundaries eg between the ages of 40 and 55
    - The syntax is =SUMIFS(range, criteria_range1(critera), criteria_range->N(criteria))
  - The same type of syntax is used for COUNTIFS
    - To exclude a value in Excel use <> which excludes the following values
  - AVERAGEIFS is similar, the syntax is
    - =AVERAGEIFS(average_range, criteria_range, criteria, criteria_range, criteria, ...)

Date Functions
  - There are a few handy functions to know when working with dates in Excel
  - =Date() which can add different parts of a date to make a proper format date
  - You can select =year(), =month(), =day()
  - Using =now() will bring back date and time
  - Using =days(end_date, start_date) will show how many days are between numbers
  - =weeknum() will allow you to decide where weeks start eg Monday and show what week of the year it is
