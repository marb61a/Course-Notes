Primitive Type Variables
Data Types and Initialisation
  - In Java there are 8 types of primitive data
  - byte which goes from 128 to -127 
  - char which defines a single character or a number up to 65535, a letter needs to be in single quotes
  - int which is an integer is a 32 bit whole number and can go up to over 2 billion
  - double is a 64 bit decimal number
  - short is a 16 bit whole number
  - long is a 64 bit whole number which needs an l after the number to stop Java thining it is an integer
  - float is a 32 bit decimal and needs an f after the number or Java will see it as a double
  - boolean will be either true or false
  - Primitive means predefined
  - Variables should be declared in the following order data type var_name = 'variable_value';
  - This is called initialising the variable
  - Variable names can have characters, numbers, underscores, currency symbols but cannot start with a number
  - Camel casing should be used for variable names
  - Try commenting code to ensure that code is not confusing
  - In real apps remove unused variables from code
