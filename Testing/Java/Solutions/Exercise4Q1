Write a program that:
1. For a total of 10 students: Hint: ‘for (int i; i &lt; array.length; i++)’
  a. Prompts user to enter student’s name; (First Name and surname
  separated by a space);
  b. Prompts user to enter student’s grade; (Between 0 and 100);
  c. Stores the input in a 2-dimensional array.
2. For each student outputs their name and grade and whether they
  passed or failed (65% being a pass). Hint: Use ‘printf’ to format the
  output.
3. Outputs the % of students who passed and failed.
4. Prompts student to enter their name and outputs their grade.

package org.java.exercisefourqone;

import java.util.*;

public class StudentGrades {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner myScan = new Scanner(System.in);
		// Counter
		int counterMain=0;
		
		// Using arraylist rather than 2d array
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
		
		StudentFind fStudent = new StudentFind();
		
		try {
			while(counterMain == 0){
				System.out.println("This is the student grades app");
				
				System.out.println("Please enter your name, both first and last");
				String userID = myScan.nextLine();
			
				System.out.println("Please enter your score between 1 and 100");
				String userGrade = myScan.nextLine();
				
				fStudent.addStudent(new Student(sName,list));
			}
			
			
			Student studentToBeFound = book.find("Joe");
			studentToBeFound.getGrades();
			
		} catch (ArithmeticException | InputMismatchException ex){ 
			System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.toString());
		}
	}
}
