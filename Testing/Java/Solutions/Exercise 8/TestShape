1.	Write a superclass called Shape (as shown in the class diagram), which contains:
  -	Two instance variables color (String) and filled (boolean).
  -	Two constructors: a no-arg (no-argument) constructor that initializes the color to "green" and filled to true, 
    and a constructor that initializes the color and filled to the given values.
  -	Getter and setter for all the instance variables. By convention, the getter for a boolean variable xxx is called isXXX() 
    (instead of getXxx() for all the other types).
  -	A toString() method that returns "A Shape with color of xxx and filled/Not filled".

2.	Write a test program to test all the methods defined in Shape.


Moved Shape & TestShape to separate package

public class TestShape {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Shape shape1 = new Shape();
    
        System.out.println("The shape color is " + shape1.getColor() + " is filled " + shape1.isFilled());
    }
}
