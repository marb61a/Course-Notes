Create a Java program to store the names of your favourite pop albums. 
Over time, you intend to add further titles to your list. 
For this reason, you decide to use an ArrayList object to store album names, as its size can dynamically grow. 
  - Thriller 
  - The Dark Side of the Moon 
  -	Bat Out of Hell 
  -	Back in Black 
  -	Come On Over 
  -	Led Zeppelin IV 
  -	Jagged Little Pill 
Create an ArrayList object that will store strings, as you saw in the video tutorials. Add the names of the albums above to the ArrayList. 
Once you have populated the ArrayList, display its contents, using an enhanced for loop. 


package org.java.exercisefiveqone;

import java.util.*;

public class FavouriteAlbums{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner myScan = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		try{
			List<String> userAlbums = new ArrayList<String>(); 
			
			userAlbums.add(0, "Thriller");	
			userAlbums.add(1, "The Dark Side of the Moon");
			userAlbums.add(2, "Bat Out of Hell");
			userAlbums.add(3, "Back in Black");
			userAlbums.add(4, "Come On Over");
			userAlbums.add(5, "Led Zeppelin IV");
			userAlbums.add(6, "Jagged Little Pill");

			
			// Enhanced for loop
			for(String album : userAlbums){
				System.out.println(album);
			}
			
			// While loop for the same output
			Iterator iter = userAlbums.iterator();
			while (iter.hasNext()) {
				System.out.println(iter.next());
			}
		} catch(Exception ex){ 
			System.out.println("Exception: " + ex.toString());
		}
	}
}
