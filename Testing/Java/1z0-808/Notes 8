                                        Notes from the Selikoff/Boyarsky book
                                        
                                        
Ordering Elements in a Class
Element Example                           Required?                                   Where does it go?
Package declaration package abc;          No                                          First line in the file
Import statements                         import java.util.*;                         No Immediately after the package
Class declaration                         public class C                              Yes Immediately after the import
Field declarations int value;             No                                          Anywhere inside a class
Method declarations void method()         No                                          Anywhere inside a class
  - We can put comments anywhere, and imports are optional.
  - Fields and methods must be within a class.
  - The acronym PIC can be used Package, Imports, Class
  - Multiple classes can be defined in the same fi le, but only one of them is allowed to be public.
  - A file is also allowed to have neither class be public.
  - You will also need to understand inner classes for the 809 exam

Destroying Objects
  - Java provides a garbage collector to automatically look for objects that are not needed anymore.
  - All Java objects are stored in your program memory’s heap.
  - The heap is also referred to a the free store
  - The heap may be quite large, depending on your environment, but there is always a limit to its size.
  - There are many different algorithms for garbage collection
  - You do not need to know these algorithms for the exam
  - You do need to know that System.gc() is not guaranteed to run and when objects are eligible for collection
  - System.gc()  suggests that now might be a good time for Java to kick off a garbage collection run, Java may ignore it
  - An object is no longer reachable when one of two situations occurs:
    - The object no longer has any references pointing to it.
    - All references to the object have gone out of scope.
  - Java allows objects to implement a method called finalize() that might get called.
  - This method gets called if the garbage collector tries to collect the object.
  - If the garbage collector does not run then the method does not get called
  - If the garbage collector fails to collect the object and tries to run it again it does not get called a second time
  - You are highly unlikely to use it in real projects.
  - There is not much on the exam about finalize()

Benefits of Java
  - Java is an object-oriented language
  - Java supports access modifiers to protect data from unintended access and modification.
  - Platform independent which is known as “write once, run everywhere.”
  - One of the major advantages of Java over C++ is that it prevents memory leaks.
