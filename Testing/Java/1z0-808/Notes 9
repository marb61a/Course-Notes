Understanding Java Operators
  - A Java operator is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literals which returns a result
  - These can be referred to as operands
  - For the OCA exam, you’ll need know a specific subset of Java operators, how to apply them and the order of application
  - Java operators are not necessarily evaluated from left-to-right order.
Order of operator precedence
  Operator Symbols                              Examples
  Post-unary operators                          expression++, expression--
  Pre-unary operators                           ++expression, --expression
  Other unary operators                         +, -, !
  Multiplication/Division/Modulus               *, /, %
  Addition/Subtraction                          +, -
  Shift operators                               <<, >>, >>>
  Relational operators                          <, >, <=, >=, instanceof
  Equal to/not equal to                         ==, !=
  Logical operators                             &, ^, |
  Short-circuit logical operators               &&, ||
  Ternary operators                             boolean expression ? expression1 : expression2
  Assignment operators                          =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, !=, <<=, >>=, >>>=

Working with Binary Arithmetic Operators
  - Binary Operators are by far the most common in Java
  - Binary operators are commonly combined in complex expressions with more than two variables
  - This means that operator precedence is very important in evaluating expressions.
Arithmetic Operators
  - Multiplication operators have a higher precedence than addition operators
  - int x = 2 * 5 + 3 * 4 - 8; the 2 * 5 and 3 * 4  is assessed first
  - You can change the order of operation explicitly by wrapping parentheses around the sections you want evaluated first.
  - int x = 2 * ((5 + 3) * 4 – 8); firstly you would evaluate addition operator 10 + 3
  - Be sure to understand the difference between arithmetic division and modulus.
  - For integer values, division results in the floor value of the nearest integer that fulfills the operation
  - Modulus results in the remainder of an operation eg 20 % 3 is 2
  - The modulus operation is not limited to positive integer values and may also be applied to negative and floating-point integers.
  - For the OCA exam, though, you are not required to be able to take the modulus of a negative integer or a floating - point number.
Numeric Promotion Rules
  - If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two data types.
  - If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value to the floating-point values data type.
  - Smaller data types, eg byte,et are first promoted to int any time they are used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of them is an int. 
  - After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have the same data type as its promoted operands.
  - The 3rd and 4th cause problems for people
