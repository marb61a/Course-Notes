Working with Unary Operators
By definition, a unary operator is one that requires exactly one operand, or variable, to function.
Unary operator                                    Description
  +                                               Indicates a number is positive, although numbers are assumed
                                                  to be positive in Java unless accompanied by a negative unary operator
  -                                               Indicates a literal number is negative or negates an expression
  ++                                              Increments a value by 1
  --                                              Decrements a value by 1
  !                                               Inverts a Booleanâ€™s logical value

Logical Complement and Negation Operators
The logical complement operator, !, flips the value of a boolean expression. For example,
if the value is true, it will be converted to false, and vice versa. To illustrate this, compare
the outputs of the following statements:

boolean x = false;
System.out.println(x); // false
x = !x;
System.out.println(x); // true
Likewise, the negation operator, -, reverses the sign of a numeric expression, as shown
in these statements:
double x = 1.21;
