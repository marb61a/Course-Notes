Classes v Files
  - Often Java classes are defined in a .java file of their own
  -  !!! Java does not require that this class be public
  - You can put multiple classes in a file if needed
  - At most there is only one public class allowed in a file
  - The public class name and the file name must match to avoid errors

Main Method
 - A Java program begins execution with its main() method.
 - It can be considered as the gateway between the startup of a Java process and a developers code
 - This startup is managed by the JVM
 - The JVM calls on the underlying system to allocate memory and CPU time, access files, and so on.
Syntax
  - A simple class with main method looks like this
    - public class Zoo {
    -   public static void main(String[] args){
    -
    -   }
    - }
  - The class itself does nothing but offer an entry point
  - You will need access to a command line to run the program
    - DOS prompt \ Powershell in Windows
    - Terminal in Linux
  - To compile and execute this code, type it into a fi le called Zoo.java and execute the following:
    - javac Zoo.java
    - java Zoo
  - To compile Java code, the file must have the extension .java
  - The result is a file of bytecode by the same name, but with a .class filename extension.
  - Bytecode consists of instructions that the JVM knows how to execute.
  - The .class extension is not used when running the file as it is reserved by the JVM
  - In practice when writing main, you can write String[] args, String args[] or String...args; the compiler accepts any of these.
  - The characters [] are brackets and represent an array. array indexes begin with 0 in Java.
  - Spaces are used at the command line to separate arguments
    - java Zoo tiger lion will be arguments [0] and [1]
  - If there are not enough arguments then there will an error called an exception
    - In this particular case it is java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
    - This is because the array is expecting a certain amount of arguments which are not there
