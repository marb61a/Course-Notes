                                        Notes from the Selikoff/Boyarsky book
                                        
                                        
Understand Package Declarations And Imports
  - Java comes with thousands of built-in classes
    - This is without the countless ones that developers make
  - There is a need for organising them
  - Java puts classes in packages. These are logical groupings for classes.
  - Import statements tell Java which packages to look in for classes.
  - The import statement tells the compiler which package to look in to find a class.
  - Package names are hierarchical 
  - If it begins with java or javax, this means it came with the JDK
  - If it starts with something else, it likely shows where it came from using the website name in reverse.
    - This is called reverse domain naming
  - There will be package names on the exam that don’t follow this convention. Don’t be surprised to see package names like a.b.c.
  - The exam does not try to trick you by giving invalid package names

Wildcards
  - Classes in the same package are often imported together
  - There is a shortcut for importing all in a class * eg import java.util.*
  - The * character is called a wildcard

Redundant Imports
  - You do not need to explicitly import java.lang as it is automatic
  - To do this import would mean import redundancy
  - When testing your understanding of packages and imports, the OCA exam will use packages you may never have seen before.

Syntax
  - What would get the following class to work
  - public class InputImports {
  -   public void read(Files files) {
  -     Paths.get("name");
  -   }
  - }
  - There are 2 answers
    - The short answer import java.nio.file.*; 
    - The long answer is to import more specific import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Paths;
  - There are some imports in this case which will not work
    - import java.nio.*; -- This is not good as a wild card only matches class names not "file.*Files"
    - import java.nio.*.*; -- You can only have one wildcard and it must be at the end
    - import java.nio.files.Paths.*; -- You cannot impor methods only class names
