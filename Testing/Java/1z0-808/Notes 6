                                        Notes from the Selikoff/Boyarsky book
 
 
 Reference Types
  - A reference type refers to an object
  - References do not hold the value of the object that they refer to
  - Instead, a reference “points” to an object by storing the memory address where the object is located
  - This is called a pointer, some languages but not Java allow you to know what the actual address
  - A value is assigned to a reference in one of two ways
    - A reference can be assigned to another object of the same type.
    - A reference can be assigned to a new object using the new keyword.
  - There are a few important differences you should know between primitives and reference types
    - Reference types can be assigned null
    - Primitives will give an error if assigned to null
    - Reference types can be used to call methods when they do not point to null.
    - Primitives do not have methods declared on them
    - Primitive types have lowercase type names.
    - Java classes begin with an uppercase, this should be the case when creating classes of your own

Declaring and Initializing Variables
  - A variable is a name for a piece of memory that stores data
  - When you declare a variable, you need to state the variable type and a name
  - Giving a variable a value is called initialising it
  - Often it can be better to declare and initialise in the same statment
  - You can also declare multiple variables in the same statement.
    - String s1, s2;
    - String s3 = "yes", s4 = "no";
  - You can also initialize any or all of those values inline.
    - The exam will test these
    - int i1, i2, i3 = 0;
    - Only the third variable is initialised above
    - Each snippet separated by a comma is a little declaration of its own.
  - There are other tricks in the exam
    - int num, String value;
    - This will cause an error because 2 different types cannot be declared simultaneously
  - If you want to declare multiple variables in the same statement, they must share the same type declaration and not repeat it. 
    - double d1, double d2; is not legal
    - double d1, d2; would have been legal
  - int i1; int i2; is legal as they are separate statements with the semi colon
  - int i3; i4; is not legal as these are separate statements entirely
