                    Notes from the Selikoff/Boyarsky book


Chapter 1 - Java Building Blocks
  - Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. 
  - Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
  - Classes are the basic building blocks
  - When defining a class, you describe all the parts and characteristics of one of those building blocks.
  - In order to use most of these classes you will have to create objects
  - Java classes have 2 primary elements
    - Methods which are also called functions
    - Fields which are also referred to as variables
  - These variables hold the program state
    - The methods will perform operations on the state
  - If the change is important to remember, a variable stores that change.
  - Its the job of the developer/programmer to arrange these classes to be useful
  
Syntax
  - The simplest class you can write looks like class Name {}
  - The word class is a keyword in Java 
    - A keyword in Java is a word with special meaning
    - Class names begin with an uppercase character
    - The class word itself is lower case
    - Multiword class names are in camel case eg HelloEverbodyMyNameIs
  - Methods can be defined like this
    - public String getName() {
    -   return name;
    - }
    - public means that it can be used in other classes
    - String is the return type from the method
   - Also can be defined like this
     - public void getName(String newName) {
     -   return name;
     - }
     - The word void means that there is no value returned 
     - The String newName is what is given to the method to operate on, this is called the method parameter
   - The full declaration of the method is called its signature

Comments
  - Comments are a very important way of letting others know what is happening in the code
  - Because they are not executed they can be placed anywhere in the code
  - There are 3 different types of comments 
    - // Which are single line comments
    - /* */ These are multiline comments
    - /** */ These are Javadoc comments which allow the Javadoc tool to generate documentation from the project
  -
