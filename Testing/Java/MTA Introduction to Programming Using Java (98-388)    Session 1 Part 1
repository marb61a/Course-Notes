                    MTA Introduction to Programming Using Java (98-388)    Session 1
                    Course Notes

Introduction
  - Intro to the course and instructor
  - There are 2 objectives, improve job skills and cover the exam syllabus
  - Being able to predict output from code is important
  - The course uses Visual Studio Code
    - There are several extensions available for running Java
  - Writing code is the best form of practice
  - An IDE is not compulsory for running Java
  - The course will use the OpenJDK development kit 
    - There is no real difference at this level between OpenJDk and Oracle JDK
  - There are different installation processes 
  
The Use of Main
  - Every Java file needs main
  - Main syntax is Public Static Void Main(String[] args){}
    - The Public indicates that all classes have access to the method
    - Void shows that there is no return value
    - Static shows that the method can be ran without creating an object for it
  - The String[] Args part of the method declaration is an exam topic in and of itself
  - A semi-colon is needed at the end of each statement
  - To print out a statement use the following syntax -- System.out.print("Welcome to Java");
  - To run a java file it must be save with the .java suffix
  - Keywords should be in lower case eg public and static
  - Uppercase keywords will cause problems during compilation
  - It is the public keyword that makes the method available to the JVM
  - You will need to have the method inside a class or there will be errors due to misplaced constructs
  - When compiling a file the filename must match a class in the file
  - To compile at the commend prompt run --> javac filename
  - This will generate a .class file
  - To run the class file, at the prompt run --> java filename.class
  - Classes are object blueprints
  - Java is an Object Oriented Programming language (OOP)
  - To consume a class eg Product
    - Product product1 = new Product();
    - This will be a topic on the exam
