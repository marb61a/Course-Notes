                    MTA Database Administrator Fundamentals (98-364)  Part 1
                    Course Notes

Understanding Core Concepts
  - This is 23% of the exam
  - This will be relatively straightforward for anybody who has used Excel spreadsheets
  - A table is a set of data elements or attributes organised into vertical columns
    - This is where the similarity to Excel is
  - Columns have unique names in a table
    - It is not possible to have 2 columns named the same
  - Rows and attributes are unordered
 
 A table
  - This is used to store information about an entity
  - An entity is anything you want to store information about
    - This can be a person, place or thing
  - By convention entities are named in the singular
  - Entities need not be tangible
  - Column name are unique within a table
  - Entity names are unique within a database
  - Entities may be related to other entities
  
SSMS
  - SQL Server Management Studio 
  - This is a tool used by DBA's for managing the SQL infrastructure
  - To start on Windows simply type SSMS in the run box

Database Relationships
  - Flat File
    - These are simple ASCII text files
    - It is better than having manual systems
    - There is no protection againt duplicate data though
    - More than a small number of files can be very challenging to maintain
    - Flat files have no inbuilt data dependence so you will have to know where data is to find it
    - There are file compatability issues
    - CSV files are comma delimited text files
  - Relational Databases
    - Relational Database systems will resolve most of the problems associated with flat files
    - There are many types of databases such as Hierarchical, Network
    - RDBMS -- Relational Database Management System
    - An RDBMS is a software system which manages data and its access
    - It is based on the realational model by EF Codd
    - It allows for the definition of data structures such as Tables
    - It also allows for Storage and retrieval operations and integrity constraints
    - Data and the relationships between them are organised into tables
    - Data in one table can be related to data in another
      - This data is self describing through the system catalog
        - The system catalog is a list which contains all the tables and columns which are part of the db
  - RDBMS Benefits
    - Data Integrity 
      - Using Data Types to make sure data is not in the wrong location
    - Secured Access so that people only have the access they aare supposed to
    - Data sharing
    - Concurrent usage so that many people can work on the db
    - Support for standards such as SQL
      - This is the language used to interact and modify a database
  - Related Tables    
    - Table relationships are likely to be on the exam
    - Tables are often nouns
    - PK is an acronym for Primary keys
    - A primary key is a unique value
    - The primary key can be used in a different table as a foreign key
    - This will link the tables
    - There can be different table relationships
    - One to One, One to Many, Many to Many although the last is discouraged
      - Many to many are converted to 2,  1 to N tables
    - The dot notation can be usedd to qualify an attribute eg Table1.customer
  - Recursive Relationships
    - Recursive means something that refers to itself
    - In diagram form a bar on a line connecting tables means 1 and exactly 1
    - A crows foot can be used to split a line hence 1 to many
