Filtering Data using Lists and Ranges
Ranges Of Values
  - When restricting the range of values to be returned use WHERE column_name BETWEEN
  - This is then provided with a low value and a high value
  - Endpoints are included
  - Low value needs to be included first
  - BETWEEN is a great shortcut to using for selecting values
  - IN is another shortcut to avoid typing multiple columns when getting information from a list
  - IN is also a shortcut to avoid typing multiple OR values
  
Filtering Data Using Pattern Matching
String Pattern Matching
  - This uses the LIKE keyword
  - It is used on character strings Char, Varchar, NChar, NVarchar
String Comparison Operators
  - % -- Any string of zero or more characters
  - _ -- Any single character
  - [] -- Any single character within the set
  - [^] -- And single character not within the set
Using Like Operators
  - Example WHERE fruit LIKE 'Orange'
  - Example WHERE fruit LIKE 'Ap%'
    - Stings can also be used '%Apple%'
    - Spaces DO matter!! '%Apple%' differs from '% Apple %'
  - Example WHERE fruit LIKE '%p%'
  - Wildcards are not a requiremeent for using LIKE
  - Example WHERE fruit LIKE '_pp%'
    - The underscore is for a single character
    - The sceond and third characters have to be pp
  - Example WHERE fruit LIKE '[AB]%'
    - The first character has to be either an A or a B
    - You can also use a range '[0-9],[A-Z]'
