Adding Data
Inserting Data
  - The INSERT Statement is part of DML
  - This adds rows to a table
  - It is good coding practice to always provide a column list
  - Always match data types
  - There are extensions to the INSERT statement such as INSERT... SELECT and INSERT.... EXEC
  - You can insert multiple rows but need an INSERT for each
  - You can also insert partial rows but neeed to properly state the fields
  - Syntax is INSERT INTO tbl_name (Column_List) VALUES (Values Matching Comma List
  
Updating and deleting Data
Updating Data
  - Syntax for updating is UPDATE tbl_name SET column_list = values
  - You can restrict rows that can be changed
  - This is done using a WHERE clause
Deleting Data
  - It is used to change existing rows in a table
  - Uses the DELETE keyword
  - It removes records from a table and is fully logged
  - You generally cannot delete a row which is the parent of another
  - There is a more complex form of DELETE available where you delete based on what is found in another table
  - This is generally done with a sub-query
  - This sub-query determines which rows are to be deleted
  - You can use joins, this in SQL Server specific and not ANSI standard
  - There are 2 FROM clauses involved, the first idicates the table to be deleted from, the second indicates selection criteria
