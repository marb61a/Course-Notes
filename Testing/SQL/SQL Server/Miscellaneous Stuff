3 Foundations of a modern DB
  - Data
  - Attributes
  - Relationships

1 - 1 relationship
  - An association between two tables in which the primary key value of each record in the primary table corresponds to the value
  in the matching field or fields of only one record in the related table
Many to Many Relationship
  - A complex association between two sets of parameters, in which many parameters of each set can relate to many others in the
  second set. Realtionships in this type of relationship can be very complex
Parent-Child
  - In the tree structure a parent in one step closer to the root
Constraints
  - Unlike the primary key you can have more than one constraint per table
  - 7 types Unique, Check, Default, Not Null, Primary Key, Foreign Key, Identity
DB Objects
  - Divided into 2 categories Storage & Programmability
  
DML
  - MUDIS -- MERGE, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT
DDL
  - ADDCUT -- ALTER, DELETE, DROP, CREATE, UPDATE TRUNCATE
System Tables 
  - The sys.Object contains a row for every object in the database  

Schema
  - The subschema defines the portion of the database “seen” by the application programs
**** Char will hold a fixed type string
Code Page 
  – ordered set of characters, keyboard layouts etc
T-SQL
  - Transact-SQL is an extension of the SQL language
  - Has features in addition to ANSI92 standard
  
Functions and routines can be synonymous and they are commands that return a value
Aggregate Functions
  - AVG() - Returns the average value
  - COUNT() - Returns the number of rows
  - FIRST() - Returns the first value
User Defined Functions
  - Written incompact SQL code which can accept parameters and returns either a value or a table
Normal Form
  - An approach to structuring (organizing) information to avoid redundancy and inconsistency and to promote efficient
  maintenance, storage, and updating.
  - Each level is a refinement of the previous one

Data Integrity
  - Entity integrity where focus is on the primary key.
  - Referential integrity where the focus is on the the foreign key
  - Domain integrity which specifies that all allowable values in a relational database must be declared.
