3 Foundations of a modern DB
  - Data
  - Attributes
  - Relationships

1 - 1 relationship
  - An association between two tables in which the primary key value of each record in the primary table corresponds to the value
  in the matching field or fields of only one record in the related table
Many to Many Relationship
  - A complex association between two sets of parameters, in which many parameters of each set can relate to many others in the
  second set. Realtionships in this type of relationship can be very complex
Parent-Child
  - In the tree structure a parent in one step closer to the root
Constraints
  - Unlike the primary key you can have more than one constraint per table
  - 7 types Unique, Check, Default, Not Null, Primary Key, Foreign Key, Identity
DB Objects
  - Divided into 2 categories Storage & Programmability
DML
  - MUDIS -- MERGE, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT
DDL
  - ADDCUT -- ALTER, DELETE, DROP, CREATE, UPDATE TRUNCATE
System Tables 
  - The sys.Object contains a row for every object in the database
