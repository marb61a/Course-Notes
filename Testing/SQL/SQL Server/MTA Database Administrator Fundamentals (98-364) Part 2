                    MTA Database Administrator Fundamentals (98-364) Part 2
Understanding DML
Structured Query Language
  - There are many ways to pronounce this, this is not important
  - SQL is an industry standard language
  - This means that there will be huge amounts of shared syntax between vendors
  - There are 3 different parts of SQL
    - DDL which stands for Data Definition Language
      - This is the part of SQL that defines the object
    - DML or Data Manipulation Language
      - This is the part of the language that allows to select, update, insert and delete data
    - DCL or Data Control Language
      - This is part of the languages that is concerned with security
    - These will be probably be asked on the exam
DDL/DML
  - DDL Syntax includes CREATE
    - You can create Tables, Views, Indexes, Schemas
  - DML Syntax includes the following
  - To alter the table use the ALTER TABLE command
  - To remove the table do not use DELETE TABLE us DROP TABLE
  - INSERT adds new row into a table
  - UPDATE will change existing data in a table
  - DELETE will delete the data in a table but the table will still need to be dropped
DCL
  - The main pieces of syntax for DCL are GRANT, REVOKE, DENY
  - In DCL you can also CREATE, ALTER or DROP roles
    - Roles are groups of permissions and people
    - A login is a higher role than a db as it allows connection to a server
    
    
    
DB Data Types
  - This section accounts for 23% of the exam
Data Types
  - Objects that contain data, that data has a type
  - Data Types define the kind of data such as return values, columns, parameters etc
  - You will need to understand how much disk space each type uses as well as the types
  - There will be exam questions about types and how much space they use
Choosing a data type
  - When choosing a data type choose the type that most closely matches what you need
  - SQL Server will then enforce the rules of the type, errors will occur if entries are too big for the type
  - The precision of the number is how many digits there are 
  - The scale of the number is how many digits to the right of the decimal
  - Reading big rows take up more disk space and are slower to process
  - To create a table simply type CREATE TABLE Table_Name
  - Table names have to be unique, the names can be up to 128 characters long
  - Inside the table definition is a list of elements which are comma seperated
SQL Data Types
  - Numeric Types -- Integer, Exact, Approximate, Money
  - Character Types -- Unicode, Non-Unicode
  - Other Types -- Date, Binary, Image, Global Identifiers, Special
Integers
  - Tinyint, 1 byte of disk storage valid values are 0 - 255
  - Smallint, 2 bytes of disk space, valid values are +/-32,767
  - Integer, 4 bytes of storage, valid values are +/- 2 billion, this is the most common type used
  - Bigint, 8 bytes of storage, valid values are +/- 9 quintillion approximately
  - Integers are commonly used as table primary keys
  - Best practice is to choose an Integer column rather than a character or variable character column
Exceeding Data Type Limits
  - NOT NULL means that a value is always required
  - You will get an error when trying to use too big a number for what was declared
Approximate Numerics
  - They store information as accurately as possible
  - This comes at a cost of preciseness
  - One example is 1 / 3 which can go on
  - With these SQL Server chooses how to deal with them
  - These should not be used for any field that will be searched
  - Users will not be able to control values
  - They should not be used in WHERE clauses
  - ANSI synonyms to be used are real() and float(24)
Character Data Types
  - Use when data entered length is consistent
  - There are 2 data types, fixed and variable length 
  - All strings are single quoted
  - Fixed length should be when length is consistent eg char(n)
  - The value can be between 1 and 8000 
Variable vs Fixed
  - The tradeoff being made with Varaible vs Fixed Length is disk space vs access speed
  - Varchar may save disk space
  - Varchar may also allow more records/pages
  - Char is slightly faster accessing columns
  - When data length is very consistent stick with char
  - Use Varchar(max) when length is above 8000 characters
Dates And Times
  - There are several different types of date formats available
  - Datetime
  - Smalldatetime
  - Date datatype which store the data only
  - Time which only stores the time
  - Datetime 2
  - Dateoffset
  - The exam only covers the first 2
Numeric And Alphabetic Date Formats
  - There are different formats available for representing dates
  - Datetime is a numeric date format
  - To use a particular format use SET DATEFORMAT
    - UK/IE format will be DMY
  - A standard alphabetic format can be better as the numeric ones can cause confusion if the wrong format is presumed
  - Using the month name and the four digit year is the recommended format
Datetime 2(n)
  - This is a new data type
  - Valid values are larger than any of the other previous data types
  - It goes from Jan 1 0001 to December 31 9999
  - It is accurate to 100 nanoseconds
  - This makes it more accurate than any of the other date types
  - It is an extension of the DateTime data type
  - It has a larger date range and precision
  - Precision can be optionally specified
ISO 8601 Format
  - This is an international standard
  - It is unambiguous and will work everywhere
  - You do have to supply most of the parts needed
  - It is unaffected by settings from one connection to another
  - The format is yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]
DateTimeOffset
  - This acts like Datetime 2(n) but adds timezone information
  - It is 2 bytes larger than Datetime 2(n)
  - This 2 bytes is for the timezone offset
  - Date stores the date and not the time
  - Time stores the time and not the date
