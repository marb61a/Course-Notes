                    MTA Database Administrator Fundamentals (98-364) Part 2
Understanding DML
Structured Query Language
  - There are many ways to pronounce this, this is not important
  - SQL is an industry standard language
  - This means that there will be huge amounts of shared syntax between vendors
  - There are 3 different parts of SQL
    - DDL which stands for Data Definition Language
      - This is the part of SQL that defines the object
    - DML or Data Manipulation Language
      - This is the part of the language that allows to select, update, insert and delete data
    - DCL or Data Control Language
      - This is part of the languages that is concerned with security
    - These will be probably be asked on the exam
DDL/DML
  - DDL Syntax includes CREATE
    - You can create Tables, Views, Indexes, Schemas
  - DML Syntax includes the following
  - To alter the table use the ALTER TABLE command
  - To remove the table do not use DELETE TABLE us DROP TABLE
  - INSERT adds new row into a table
  - UPDATE will change existing data in a table
  - DELETE will delete the data in a table but the table will still need to be dropped
DCL
  - The main pieces of syntax for DCL are GRANT, REVOKE, DENY
  - In DCL you can also CREATE, ALTER or DROP roles
    - Roles are groups of permissions and people
    - A login is a higher role than a db as it allows connection to a server
    
    
    
DB Data Types
  - This section accounts for 23% of the exam
Data Types
  - Objects that contain data, that data has a type
  - Data Types define the kind of data such as return values, columns, parameters etc
  - You will need to understand how much disk space each type uses as well as the types
  - There will be exam questions about types and how much space they use
Choosing a data type
  - When choosing a data type choose the type that most closely matches what you need
  - SQL Server will then enforce the rules of the type, errors will occur if entries are too big for the type
  - The precision of the number is how many digits there are 
  - The scale of the number is how many digits to the right of the decimal
  - Reading big rows take up more disk space and are slower to process
  - To create a table simply type CREATE TABLE Table_Name
  - Table names have to be unique, the names can be up to 128 characters long
  - Inside the table definition is a list of elements which are comma seperated
SQL Data Types
  - Numeric Types -- Integer, Exact, Approximate, Money
  - Character Types -- Unicode, Non-Unicode
  - Other Types -- Date, Binary, Image, Global Identifiers, Special
Integers
  - Tinyint, 1 byte of disk storage valid values are 0 - 255
  - Smallint, 2 bytes of disk space, valid values are +/-32,767
  - Integer, 4 bytes of storage, valid values are +/- 2 billion, this is the most common type used
  - Bigint, 8 bytes of storage, valid values are +/- 9 quintillion approximately
  - Integers are commonly used as table primary keys
  - Best practice is to choose an Integer column rather than a character or variable character column
Exceeding Data Type Limits
  - NOT NULL means that a value is always required
  - You will get an error when trying to use too big a number for what was declared
Approximate Numerics
  - They store information as accurately as possible
  - This comes at a cost of preciseness
  - 
Character Data Types
  -
Variable vs Fixed
  -
Dates And Times
