Understanding DML
Structured Query Language
  - There are many ways to pronounce this, this is not important
  - SQL is an industry standard language
  - This means that there will be huge amounts of shared syntax between vendors
  - There are 3 different parts of SQL
    - DDL which stands for Data Definition Language
      - This is the part of SQL that defines the object
    - DML or Data Manipulation Language
      - This is the part of the language that allows to select, update, insert and delete data
    - DCL or Data Control Language
      - This is part of the languages that is concerned with security
    - These will be probably be asked on the exam
DDL/DML
  - DDL Syntax includes CREATE
    - You can create Tables, Views, Indexes, Schemas
  - DML Syntax includes the following
  - To alter the table use the ALTER TABLE command
  - To remove the table do not use DELETE TABLE us DROP TABLE
  - INSERT adds new row into a table
  - UPDATE will change existing data in a table
  - DELETE will delete the data in a table but the table will still need to be dropped

DCL
  - The main pieces of syntax for DCL are GRANT, REVOKE, DENY
  - In DCL you can also CREATE, ALTER or DROP roles
    - Roles are groups of permissions and people
    - A login is a higher role than a db as it allows connection to a server
