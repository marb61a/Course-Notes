Primary, Foreign, and Composite Keys
Primary Keys 
  - This will serve as a review of previous sections
  - Every row must have a value
    - All values must be unique
  - PK's can be one or more columns
  - You should avoid using natural keys
  - Candidate keys are keys which guarantee uniqueness
  - Keys with no meaning are best
  - Integers are good for keys
Foreign Keys
  - Entities may be related
    - One to many is a type of relationship they may have
Composite Keys
  - Where more than 1 column is required to make the column unique
  - SQL Server can enforce uniqueness with PK's
  - Add a Primary Key attribute to a particular column definition
  
  
Clustered Indexes
Overview
  - Indexing will store values from tables in a separate structure
  - This will mean using additional disk space
  - However they can be beneifical
  - Indexes can improve SELECT statements performance considerably
