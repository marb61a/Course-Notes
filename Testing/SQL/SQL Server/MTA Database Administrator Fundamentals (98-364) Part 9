                    MTA Database Administrator Fundamentals (98-364) Part 9


Database Backup and Restore
SQL Backup Methods
  - Crashes WILL happen so be prepared by having backups
  - There are several backup methods available to SQL Server
  - Full DB backup, Incremental backup
  - For the exam you will need to know Full backup and Incremental
  - There are also other types such as File, Filegroup, Tail-log, Copy Only etc 
Backup Rights and Permissions
  - Like in other parts of SQL Server backups can be controlled by permissions
    -  sysadmin fixed server role
    - db_owner fixed database role
    - db_backupoperator
  - Permissions can be created and granted
  - The syntax is GRANT backup database
Backup to Disk
  - Files can be backed up to disk, this is a very common way of performing backups
  - Files can also be stored on a foreign by using a UNC name
  - Using a UNC is safer than using a local disk
  - Permissions will of course be required on the UNC disk
  - Backing up to a disk is a fast operation
  - It can be more expensive using disk storage than tape
Backup Frequency
  - If a DB backs up quickly then frequent backups should be used
  - If a DB is large then less frequent backups are probably better
  - If a DB has valuable information then frequent backups should definitely be used
