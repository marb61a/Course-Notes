Database Backup and Restore
SQL Backup Methods
  - Crashes WILL happen so be prepared by having backups
  - There are several backup methods available to SQL Server
  - Full DB backup, Incremental backup
  - For the exam you will need to know Full backup and Incremental
  - There are also other types such as File, Filegroup, Tail-log, Copy Only etc 
Backup Rights and Permissions
  - Like in other parts of SQL Server backups can be controlled by permissions
    -  sysadmin fixed server role
    - db_owner fixed database role
    - db_backupoperator
  - Permissions can be created and granted
  - The syntax is GRANT backup database
Backup to Disk
  - Files can be backed up to disk, this is a very common way of performing backups
  - Files can also be stored on a foreign by using a UNC name
  - Using a UNC is safer than using a local disk
  - Permissions will of course be required on the UNC disk
  - Backing up to a disk is a fast operation
  - It can be more expensive using disk storage than tape
Backup Frequency
  - If a DB backs up quickly then frequent backups should be used
  - If a DB is large then less frequent backups are probably better
  - If a DB has valuable information then frequent backups should definitely be used
Full Backups
  - A checkpoint copies on the data in memory and puts it on disks
  - All of the DB files are backed up
  - All of the data pages are also backed up
  - Even full text backups are included
  - Backups should be done on a regular basis
  - After creating a large index a backup should be done
  - The syntax for a full back up is 
    - BACKUP DATABASE db_name TO DISK 'C:\path..'
  - If unable to remember the location of a backup device you can add a dump device
    - The syntax to add a dump device EXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', remembered_name, 'C:\path....'
Restore v Recovery
  - Recovery is an automatic process
  - The happens everytime SQL starts
  - It rolls forward completed SQL transactions
  - It rolls back incompleted transactions
  - It rolls forward any transactions found in the log that were committed but not written
  - It will undo any transactions which did not commit but were prematurely committed
  - Recovery mode is an attribute of a DB
  - To back up a DB with compression simply BACKUP the DB with the WITH COMPRESSION command added on to the end
Restore
  - There are as many restore types as there are backup types
  - These include full, differential and incremental
  - SQL Server now includes text files
  - Other restore types include Online Restore, Piecemeal Restore, Page Restore, With Stop At etc
The Restore Process
  - Firstly SQL Server Safety checks first
  - The first is the Database name check
  - The next is to ensure that the file set is the same as the backup set
  - Files should be present and complete
  - After the safety checkas are passed it recreates the db and loads all files
  - Then all of the data is copied into the files
The RESTORE command
  - Firstly you need to be in the master database
  - The syntax to restore a database is RESTORE DATABASE db_name FROM db_location
  - To restore from disk RESTORE DATABASE db_name FROM DISK 'C:\db_location'
  - When restoring from a tape use RESTORE DATABASE db_name FROM TAPE


Incremental Backups
Incremental Backup Usage
  - Incremental backups will have to be done
  - There are several reasons to do an incremental backup
  - A full backup will take too long
    - Doing full backups consumes a lot of resources
    - Also a lot of data in a full back will be unchanged if being done regularly
  - A full backup will smaller incremental backups is a much better strategy
  - An incremental back up has only changes made since the last backup
  - Incremental backups for this reason are much quicker
  - Recovery of Information after a crash
    - If information has not been backed up then it cannot be recovered after a crash
