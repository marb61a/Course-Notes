Database Security Concepts
SQL Security Steps 
  - Company data is one of its most important assets
  - There are 3 main steps to SQL security
  - The first is a login to the server
    - This login should allow access to the server but no permissions for any of the databases
  - The second item is that you should be added as a user in the DB
  - The third is that a user in the DB still needs permission to make changes
Fixed Server roles
  - There are a couple of control levels for SQL Server security
  - This is security applied at the DB level and at the server level
  - There are several fixed server roles
    - sysadmin              -- Can do anything
    - dbcreator             -- Can create or alter databases
    - bulkadmin             -- Execute bulk inserts
    - diskadmin             -- Manage disk files
    - processadmin          -- Alter connections
    - serveradmin           -- Alter server state
    - setupadmin            -- Alter linked servers
    - securityadmin         -- Control server
    - public                -- View any database
  - A role is a collection of permissions
  - Permissions can be placed on several items such as roles, users, schemas, routes, services, certificates etc
