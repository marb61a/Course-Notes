Data Normalisation
Database Design Phases
  - The first phase of database design is the conceptual phase
    - This deals with the conceptual idea of the business
    - You will decide what items are and aren't important
    - How do these items then relate to one another
    - User views of the db are in user language
  - The second phase of the process is the Logical phase
    - This is where normalisation techniques are used which will optimise data appropriately
  - The next phase is the Physical phase
    - This involves working with a specific database
    - Primary and Foriegn keys will be implemented
DB Normalisation
  - This is the formal methodology for logical DB design
  - This is where the tables are organised and refined
  - This process makes the DB more flexible and easier to maintain
  - Redundancy is reduces in the DB
  - It helps address anomalies cause by INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
  - It also helps to avoid query bias, this means not answering 1 particular question
    - It means being able to answer questions about many different areas
  - It makes it easy to add new information without needing fixes
  - Each attribute must be a fact about the key
DB Design Problems
  - Poor DB design can kill a project
    - The project can be rejected due to performance and maintainability issues
  - Good design methodology can help eliminate redundant data
Anomalies
  - Row INSERT Anomoaly
    - INSERT Anomaly is the inabilty to add records because a primary key is not available
    - DELETE Anomaly similar to above but where records are being removed from a table
    - UPDATE Anomaly is related to redundant data too, if there is redundant data the will be inconsistencies
