Creating And Manipulating Tables
Table Types
  - ANSI standard SQL can be used on any DB System
  - There are several different types of table
    - This is what the exam focuses on
  - Standard user-defined tables
  - System tables which are created automatically and will contain metadata
  - Wide tables
  - Partitioned 
  - Temporary
Simple Syntax
  - The syntax for creating a table is CREATE TABLE
  - dbo is the schema
  - Table names have to be unique
  - After the table definition there is a comma seperated list of column names and properties
    - These are in a set of brackets
  - Row size max is about 8000 characters
NULL or NOT NULL
  - NOT NULL means that a column value will be required
  - NULL means that a column value is optional
  - Both of these deal with business issues
  - A rule of thumb is if unspecified DO NOT rely on defaults
Adding Columns
  - A table can hav colums added to it using ALTER TABLE
  - Alongside this should be the ADD COLUMN command to add a column of a specific type and name
  - You will need a default value if using NOT NULL and want a specific value
  - Columns can be altered as well as added, this is done with ALTER COLUMN
Unique Constraints
  - When applied to columns this guarantees uniqueness of the rows
