Creating And Manipulating Tables
Table Types
  - ANSI standard SQL can be used on any DB System
  - There are several different types of table
    - This is what the exam focuses on
  - Standard user-defined tables
  - System tables which are created automatically and will contain metadata
  - Wide tables
  - Partitioned 
  - Temporary
Simple Syntax
  - The syntax for creating a table is CREATE TABLE
  - dbo is the schema
  - Table names have to be unique
  - After the table definition there is a comma seperated list of column names and properties
    - These are in a set of brackets
  - Row size max is about 8000 characters
NULL or NOT NULL
  - NOT NULL means that a column value will be required
  - NULL means that a column value is optional
  - Both of these deal with business issues
  - A rule of thumb is if unspecified DO NOT rely on defaults
Adding Columns
  - A table can hav colums added to it using ALTER TABLE
  - Alongside this should be the ADD COLUMN command to add a column of a specific type and name
  - You will need a default value if using NOT NULL and want a specific value
  - Columns can be altered as well as added, this is done with ALTER COLUMN
Unique Constraints
  - When applied to columns this guarantees uniqueness of the rows
  - This prevents duplication of data
  - It creates a unique index which copies values into an additional structure
  - To use add the UNIQUE keyword eg CHAR(24) UNIQUE

Selecting Data
SELECT Statement
  - This is the largest statement in SQL
  - It is used to retrieve information from a database
  - Syntax is SELECT information FROM DB
  - When slecting a column list youe are saying the columns to retrieved and also the order
Performing a SELECT
  - Microsoft has sample databases Adventureworks
  - To select all use SELECT * FROM
  - You can use expressions eg SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE .......
    - This is a very important concept
  - You can embed SELECT statements within each other
  - Use the AS keyword to alias something
  - AS is the preferred method of aliasing
  - SELECT First_Name, Last_Name will return them in order
Special Character Considerations
  - Special characters such as spaces etc should be enclosed in square braces
  - This delimeter stops what is supposed to be a single being parsed as multiples
Using Operators
  - You can use many diffferent operators in statements
  - Arithmetic such as +, -, *, /, %
  - Assignment operator =
  - Bitwise Operators %, |, ^
  - Comparison Operators <=, >=, >, <, != 
  - Logical Operators such as AND, OR, ANY, ALL, NOT etc
  - The string concatenation operator +
  - Unary operators +, -, ~
Schemas Defined
  - There can be multiple schemas in a DB
  - Essentially it is a container for tables
