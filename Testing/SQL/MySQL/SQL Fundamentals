                    SQL Fundamentals
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Foundations of Relational Databases
1 - Welcome & Tech Check
A brief welcome to the course
  - This is a more general course on SQL
  - The advanced will concentrate on product specific SQL

2 - Relational Algebra & Codds Relational Model
What makes something a database in general
  - It is a collection of persisted data
  - Write data and read it out later
  - There are various types of databases which fit this broad definition
    - Graph databases such as Neo4J which are great for something like building a social network
      - Some of this will be cumbersome to store in a regular database
    - MongoDB is great for storing documents
      - SQL databases have begun to catch up on MongoDB in this regard
    - Column stores allow for selecting a couple of columns from a table which may have 100's
      - This is different from traditional databases as using MySQL etc will not save many resources
    - Key-Value stores are like a flat JS object
      - Redis is the best known of these, DynamoDB is an Amazon product
    - SQLite is an embedded DB which means it operates off of a file rather than having a server
      - It is somewhat similar to an Excel workbook
The course will focus on traditional DB eg MySQL etc
  - The course exercises can be done on the 3 DB's in the course
  - It is only towards the end that differences will be shown in how exercises can be done
