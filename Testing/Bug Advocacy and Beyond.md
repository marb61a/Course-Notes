<h1><p align=center>Module 2 – Testing – A Social Process </h1><br/>

Bug Report
  -
  - A bug report is a tester's primary work product
    - It is a tester's tool which sells a developer the idea of investing time into fixing the bug
  - This report will decided the quality of communication between a team
  - Information about a bug should be very clear and concise as well as attention grabbing
  - It is very important that bug reports be very clear
    - Bug reports are not something that only professional testers do 
    - Many bugs go unfixed due to not communicating the importance to the relevant stakeholders 
  - Bugs reports should always be reviewed and updated where necessary
  - One example bug workflow is available at the following URL
    - https://www.edlin.org/computing/bugtracking_workflow_process.html 
  
Testing – A Social Process
  -
  - Testers will usually work with a team, usually including different stakeholders 
  - There will be some issues within working with and within a team
    - Time with the team itself is likely to be limited
    - Developers are usually overcommitted with work so they will be under pressure
    - Customers are not forgiving to companies that are late with thing, this creates its own pressure
    - There are tradeoffs needed such as testing more or whether to improve reporting
    - Very often testers will be the bearers of bad news
  - The above can lead to a social kind of pressure on testers   
  
Risk
  -
  - Identifying and communicating the various risks is very important as a tester
  - Every piece of software or application is prone to certain risks
    - These cover everything from security to usability 
  - Having no risk would mean there was no need for testing
  - Find and communicate the risks that you discover
  - There will be a time when the business side willl be worried about risks
  - Study any existing information or bug reports available to see their impact, the risk levels etc 
  - A recommend ebook is Software Bug Stories
    - https://leanpub.com/softwarebugstories 
  
Importance of Persuasion
  -
  - Persuasion is a critical but overlooked skill in testing
  - Persuasion is needed to covince stakeholders to fix bugs which they may not otherwise consider
  - There are a lot of social factors that are involved in the ability to persuade

<h1><p align=center>Module 3 – Bug Advocacy – What & Why? </h1><br/>

What is Bug Advocacy?
  -
  - Bug Advocacy is presenting a bug in its strongest most honest lights
  - It connects bugs with concerns of multiple stakeholders
  - Good bug advocacy enables good decision making
  
Selling Bugs
  -
  - At certain levels bug advocacy is selling bugs
  - Simply reporting a bug and expecting immediate fixing is not always going to happen
  - Using some sales techniques such as showing product benefits will help when advocating for bugs to be fixed
  - Bug advocates will help bring their colleagues on this journey similar to the customers journey from sales
    - https://www.salesforce.com/products/guide/lead-gen/customer-journeys/
  - Professional testers will always add more information than just the baseics to bug reports  
  
Motivating the Buyer
  -
  - The maybe occasions where there is a need to motivate a developer to fix a bug
    - Again this will be very similar to motivating buyers that sales people use to entice buyers 
  - Ensure that they understand that the issue will affect lots of people
  - Fixing the bug is going to be comparitively easy compared to the consequences of not fixing it
  -
