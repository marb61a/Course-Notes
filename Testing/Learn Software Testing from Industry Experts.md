<h1><p align=center>What is Software Testing? <h1></ br>

Overview: What is Software Testing 
  -
  - There are a lot of different definitions of what software testing is
  - The instructor defines software test as learning about software concerns that matter to stakeholders so they can make good decisions
  - Software testing can be done for many different purposes and they may inform what you think software testing is
  - It can be about things like
    - Learning about product behaviour, product impact, a search for truth in the product
    - Is there knowledge or wisdom about the product
    - Is the market accepting a product, is it suitable for certain things, does it meet legal obligations
    - Does the product comply to standards, is testing trying to solve a mystery
    - Learning about something and informing others
  - Sometimes testing is about Validation 
    - Does it do what we intended it to do, are we testing the right thing 
  - Testing can also be about Verifying
    - Verification is checking to ensure thing are being done the right way, results today should match yesterday if there are no changes
    - We can check to see if there are limitations due to problem solutions
    - Most of what is called regression testing is verifying
    - Some testing is verifying, some is validating, most of it is learning
  - Sometimes the purpose of testing is exploration
    - Looking for side effects, answering questions to see if there is any interference, to check areas where there has been no checks previously
  - Very often software testing is in a position of gate-keeping
    - This means assessing if software is ready for release
    - Are the current risks acceptable to stakeholders
  - Testing can also be about improving the development process
    - Testing can provide insights into product quality as well as process quality
    - Testing results can give feddback to process improvement
  - Demonstrating that something works as it it supposed to is another reason to test
  - There are a multitude of approaches to software testing
    - Some testing is to try something out, other is to challenge the system
    - Some testing is to perform experiments, some is to sample parts, other testing is to compare parts, confimation of areas is another testing approach
    - There are about 100 different approaches to testing
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYkaY12o6lg
  - There are also many different approaches to when in the process testing is done
    - Is it part of the software development process
    - It could be part of a product or technological acquisition process
    - It may be part of market analysis or scientific research
    - It could even be part of a programming technique such as TDD

Different Definitions of Software Testing
  -
  - There are multiple different definitions available from a multitude of source
  - There is no right or wrong version
  - https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec-ieee:29119:-1:ed-2:v1:en
	
Philosophy of Testing
  -
  - What a team defines software testing as is usually defined by their philosophy of test
  - Testing Philosophy comes from a few areas
    - Software Engineering where the question is when do you know you are finished
  - There could be one defect per 10 lines of code
  - Program testing can be used to show the presnce of bugs but not the absence
  - There are stakeholders to consider with their own concerns
  - How is priority guaged and importance assessed 
  - What is the scope and what matters in the testing
  - How deep does the testing go, should it be shallow or deep and harsher 
 
Conclusion: What is Software Testing
  -
  - This a wrap up of what the chapter covered
  - Have your own view on what testing is and share it
  - Do not get stuck in a binary black and white failr or pass mindset
  - There will be bias in what testing is considered as being

<h1><p align=center>Understanding of Quality 5 Lessons<h1></ br>

Overview: Understanding of Quality
  -
  - What is your understanding of quality
    - This is often asked at interviews or when people start at a new organisation
    - Quality means different things to different people
      - Testers will have different biews on what quality is when compared to customers
      - Different views of quality may cause some project risks
    - A personal understanding of quality guides and informs important life decisions
    - A software tester will be asked to learn and share insights about services and technologies
    - Sometimes an understanding of quality can be shown by describing its absence
    - If attending an interview look up what the mission statement is on quality
      - Sometimes there are questions that will be tricky and may end up being traps on how you understand quality
        - One example is whether quality is subjective or objective
          - This may end up being difficult as it will depend on what is being talked about and how this particular subject would be assessed for quality
        - How can quality be measured
          - This is also difficult, attributes of systems can be measured but again how quality is defined will inform this answer
        - How can quality be assured
          - Processes can be looked at and adapted to ensure that issues do not reoccur
  - 
  
Understanding Quality with the Example of a Big Telco Company
  -
  - Individual organisation case study on quality
  - There are some common factors that will cover all individual companies
    - Context, Quality Definition, Formal Standards, Concerns, References
  
Understanding Quality with the Example of a Virtual Meeting Software

<h1><p align=center>Software Testing Tasks </h1> <br/>

Overview: What are Software Testing Tasks?
  -
  - Tasks
    - A task can be described as work to be done
    - It will usually be perfromed by a skilled practitioner to perform a goal
  - Roles
    - There are many different software development lifecycle models
    - Depending on which methodology is used, team member roles maybe siloed or team based
    - In siloed projects team members stick to tasks within their area of expertise
    - In team oriented structured work is not siloed, anyone on the team with the right skills can take on a task
	  - Siloed teams tend to use traditional models such as waterfall whereas team oriented projects us SCRUM and SaFE Agile
  - Implementation
    - There are 2 different models used push models and pull models
    - In the push model somebody delegates responsibility for completing a task
    - In the pull model the tester selects a task, this may or may not be prioritised
  - Planning
    - Testing tasks can part of planning or part of a solution
    - This will depend upon the task requirements, any development activities needed, the target environment and how it will be used
    - There are 3 reality driven Rs depending on what requirements are
      - Real technical work such as what programmers are doing
      - Real target environment that the user will be using
      - Real work flow which is what the user is trying to get done
    - A skilled tester can estimate effort and duration needed on a task based on past experience
  - Granularity
    - What is the work breakdown structure
      - https://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/
      - https://www.brighthubpm.com/project-planning/97740-work-breakdown-structure-wbs-of-software-testing/
      - Consistency in regards to independence of testers, skill orientation of testers, consistency of team goals 
      - States which covers not started, in progress and completed 	
        - An in-progress task can be blocked, this should not be a regular thing
      - Logistics
        - Tasks have preconditions which are things that need to be done prior to doing the task
        - There are dependencies which are things that must exist for the task to be done
          - This might be something like availabilty of data that is needed
        - Devliverable which in testing is usually what the findings are
    - Lifecycle models
      - The efforts for a task will differ based on the project lifecycle model
      - If using SCRUM for example this methodology recommends about 8 hours per task
      - Tasks in Waterfall should be less than the reporting period
      - If for example there was a status report on a weekly basis then that would be the level of granularity needed
      - There will be some exceptions for example security testing will likely be a continuous
      - Non-functional testing is often a longer type of task
  - Work
    - There are many different areas that tasks can be a part of
    - Infrastructure for example can include setting up the environment, setting up tools
    - Data related tasks can in some cases take up to 80% of effort
    - Customer facting tasks such as ensuring that acceptance criteria tests are met
    - Non-functional testing to measure reliability and performance or scalability of a system
    - Checking the robustness of a system to check to see if the system can be broken or stressed
    - Development related activities such as working with programmers
  - Tips
    - Try to avoid using the word Test as a verb in a task description
    - State what you want to get from the work assignement
    - Avoid using templates if possible
    - Ensure a skilled tested understands that they have the needed skills to implement a task
    - Use 160 character or less if possible when describing a task
    - Consider both the depth and scope of testing
  
Understanding Software Testing Tasks with Example- Part I
  -
  - This uses a example that the course instructor worked for previously
  - The company involved was a provider of virtualisation services
  - The technology was an n-tier web based solution
  - The project team was a self-organising SCRUM team
  - This example concerns the testing tasks that the team put together
  - One of the first tasks was supporting development
    - One task was to put together feature files for acceptance tasks
    - Another was pair brainstorming of unit test ideas
    - Construction of simulated databases
    - Construct various virtual machines ready for various systems
    - Review static analysis files as part of Continuous Integration
      - This involved using various methods to analyse software complexity
  - Tasks that were aimed at suporting customers 
  - Create feature files as part of acceptance tasks 
    - This will use things like Gherkin and Cucumber
    - Integrate Continuous Integration files into servers
    - Ensure that all acceptance tests have been run on all platforms 
    - These will be customer driven acceptance tests for these activities
  - Then there are testability activities
    - Insert hooks into the software to allow for some external control via script
    - Also insert hooks to allow for monitoring of state of backups
  - After this then came the capabilities tasks
    - Do backups happen when normal situations take place
