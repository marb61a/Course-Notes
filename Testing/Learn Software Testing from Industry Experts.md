Overview: What is Software Testing 
  -
  - There are a lot of different definitions of what software testing is
  - The instructor defines software test as learning about software concerns that matter to stakeholders so they can make good decisions
  - Software testing can be done for many different purposes and they may inform what you think software testing is
  - It can be about things like
    - Learning about product behaviour, product impact, a search for truth in the product
    - Is there knowledge or wisdom about the product
    - Is the market accepting a product, is it suitable for certain things, does it meet legal obligations
    - Does the product comply to standards, is testing trying to solve a mystery
    - Learning about something and informing others
  - Sometimes testing is about Validation 
    - Does it do what we intended it to do, are we testing the right thing 
  - Testing can also be about Verifying
    - Verification is checking to ensure thing are being done the right way, results today should match yesterday if there are no changes
    - We can check to see if there are limitations due to problem solutions
    - Most of what is called regression testing is verifying
    - Some testing is verifying, some is validating, most of it is learning
  - Sometimes the purpose of testing is exploration
    - Looking for side effects, answering questions to see if there is any interference, to check areas where there has been no checks previously
  - Very often software testing is in a position of gate-keeping
    - This means assessing if software is ready for release
    - Are the current risks acceptable to stakeholders
  - Testing can also be about improving the development process
    - Testing can provide insights into product quality as well as process quality
    - Testing results can give feddback to process improvement
  - Demonstrating that something works as it it supposed to is another reason to test
  - There are a multitude of approaches to software testing
    - Some testing is to try something out, other is to challenge the system
    - Some testing is to perform experiments, some is to sample parts, other testing is to compare parts, confimation of areas is another testing approach
    - There are about 100 different approaches to testing
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYkaY12o6lg
  - There are also many different approaches to when in the process testing is done
    - Is it part of the software development process
    - It could be part of a product or technological acquisition process
    - It may be part of market analysis or scientific research
    - It could even be part of a programming technique such as TDD

Philosophy of Testing
  -
  - What a team defines software testing as is usually defined by their philosophy of test
  - Testing Philosophy comes from a few areas
    - Software Engineering where the question is when do you know you are finished
  - There could be one defect per 10 lines of code
  - Program testing can be used to show the presnce of bugs but not the absence
  - There are stakeholders to consider with their own concerns
  - How is priority guaged and importance assessed 
  - What is the scope and what matters in the testing
  - How deep does the testing go, should it be shallow or deep and harsher
