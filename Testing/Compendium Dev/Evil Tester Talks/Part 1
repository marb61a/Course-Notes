Technical Mobile Testing - Eurostar Mobile Deep Dive 2015
Introduction for Eurostar Mobile Deep Dive 2015
  - Much of our scope of testing is driven by fear
  - We fear that the App won't work on all devices so we test on lots of devices
    - We never address the reasons why it might not work on other devices

Publicly Available Content & Overview
  - Mobile testing offers numerous challenges and the potential for massive scope creep 
  - This is with so many device combinations and tool choices available. 
  - If is not affordable to test everything so we make decisions on scope. 
  - Testers have to learn to use risk as part of the the decision making process: business risk, and technical risk. 
     
"Technical Mobile Testing" Talk Recording
  - Decisions made, Justifications and Pain Points from Mobile testing
  - Ask people who do it but do not like doing it
    - They will normally have tips and tricks on how to make things easier
  - The author dislikes mobile testing
    - This could be a risk as people tend to be good at what they like
  - Difficulties in mobile testing
    - Ergonomics, Observing, Reporting and Manipulation
  - Find work arounds for some of the issues that occur
    - This means talking to people with experience
    - You need to get some experience in order to appreciate pain points and then improve them
  - Workarounds add risk
    - You should adopt work arounds and mitigate issues#
    - Communicate properly any risks that accompany work arounds
    - Accept risks through knowledge and not fear
      - This may not always be possible
  - Testing approaches on mobile are often based on fear mitigation
    - One example is the amount of devices being tested on
    - This is done because development is not done with device compatability
    - There is a subset of devices that are built as a caveat
  - Technical risk happens on native development and it happens on web development and hybrid apps.
    - Web Development is probably worse
    - This could be from CSS styles that donâ€™t work on older mobile devices
      - Alot of JS devices suffer from this issue also
    - However testing on old phones is done just in case
      - This adds the risk that there will not be enough time to test effectively
  - It is mandated that when we test on mobile devices, we use the built in browsers.
    - This is based on the assumption that most people use them
    - Not being a normal user is a risk to most companies and applications
  - As testers it is expected to have usability issues added into the process
    - This is based on the risk that users may customise their phones
  - Add risk into the testing process
    - One example is a typing error with Auto-Completion
  - It is often forgotten that using defaults are in facts risks themselves
Automating Mobile
  - One of the natural things to try and do with mobile development is automate.
  - Automating is difficult, on mobile devices even more so
  - Automation should be done on a strategic basis 
Automating Tactically
  -
