Technical Mobile Testing - Eurostar Mobile Deep Dive 2015
Introduction for Eurostar Mobile Deep Dive 2015
  - Much of our scope of testing is driven by fear
  - We fear that the App won't work on all devices so we test on lots of devices
    - We never address the reasons why it might not work on other devices

Publicly Available Content & Overview
  - Mobile testing offers numerous challenges and the potential for massive scope creep 
  - This is with so many device combinations and tool choices available. 
  - If is not affordable to test everything so we make decisions on scope. 
  - Testers have to learn to use risk as part of the the decision making process: business risk, and technical risk.

      - This may not always be possible
  - Testing approaches on mobile are often based on fear mitigation
    - One example is the amount of devices being tested on
    - This is done because development is not done with device compatability
