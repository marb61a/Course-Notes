                    How I Test - Web App
                    Course Notes Part 1


Introduction
How I Test - Web App Case Study - Introduction
  - This course is a case study
  - It is equivalent to about a day of testing
  - This will be a practical course rather than extensive theory
  - This is because with each application we will only ever use subsets of our knowledge
  - The aim of the course is to take specific lessons from 1 app
    - And then see how they could be reused is other tests on other applications

Debrief Intro
  - A short, 'live' intro to the course and the testing approach.
  - In order to work as an actual practical course
    - The instructor is going to think through testing a web app from start to finish.

Choosing the Right Person for the Job
 - Choose which application to test should be based on my technical knowledge
 - So choosing the right application for yourself in the real world
  - This translates into choosing the right person for the job. 
  - The example app chosen in the course is Tracks 
    - This is the instructor because has some familiarity with it
    - There’s a lot of scope for testing. 
    - Tracks is an open source To Do management system where you create actions, next
actions, you put them into context i.e, Where are you going to do them?
And you can create projects for them and you can set reminders and it’s a To
Do app based on, and Dave Allen’s Getting Things Done methodology. But
ignoring the domain, it’s a very useful open source app that I think is very easy
to instal because I can download, a virtual machine or Docker and use it that
way. So I’m using Tracks and I have used it before but it’s been so long since
I used it and previously I’ve looked at different parts in the application. So
every time we approach a different app, an application, we will learn something
different. Going macro to this, like most of the time we don’t get to choose what
we test because we’d be working in environments, we’re working in companies,
there’ll be a manager, the manager will choose what we work on. But the thing
is we influence that because we have skills and experience and some of our skills
and experience and domain knowledge will not translate into some applications.
So we will not be suitable people to test that without additional training or
without offering a risk essentially to the project. Because we may not know
what we’re doing. And if I have to test a Hadoop app and I really need to
work on a team that really understands Hadoop because I will be learning that
from scratch. So I’ve done consultancy on Hadoop teams but I was relying on
their massive amounts of technical knowledge, me reading around the subject,
conducting experiments from me, asking them questions when they didn’t know
the answer so we can deep dive into it. Me applying my technical testing domain
knowledge onto their project and mixing it that way. So we have to combine
the right people at the right time to have the right team mix. This can be hard
when you’re in management. Any of you that are in management will know
that this can be hard because someone that you need on a project may not be
available because they’re on another project and you’re trying to juggle things
around and projects get delayed and put people off.
So that means we have to have some slack in our teams, or we as managers
have to have the ability to support people or know that there’ll be supported
on the team. 
  - Sometimes we allocate people to teams because of their soft skills
    - Their personality and how they will fit into that team. 
    - This is a key lesson, we have to choose the right people for the right technology
      - for the right job, otherwise there’s a risk. 
    - Else there is a process that means we have to manage it to make sure that they understand what they were doing. 
    - So that is a tiny, tiny lesson, but it is massive. 
  - What is test management. 
    - Choosing the right person for the job. 
  - What is our career management? 
    - Making sure we have the skills we need for the job. 
    - This is absolutely key to what we do, but at a micro level is choosing a particular application to test.
