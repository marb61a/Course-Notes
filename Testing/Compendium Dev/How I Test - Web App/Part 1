                    How I Test - Web App
                    Course Notes Part 1


Introduction
How I Test - Web App Case Study - Introduction
  - This course is a case study
  - It is equivalent to about a day of testing
  - This will be a practical course rather than extensive theory
  - This is because with each application we will only ever use subsets of our knowledge
  - The aim of the course is to take specific lessons from 1 app
    - And then see how they could be reused is other tests on other applications

Debrief Intro
  - A short, 'live' intro to the course and the testing approach.
  - In order to work as an actual practical course
    - The instructor is going to think through testing a web app from start to finish.

Choosing the Right Person for the Job
 - Choose which application to test should be based on my technical knowledge
 - So choosing the right application for yourself in the real world
  - This translates into choosing the right person for the job. 
  - The example app chosen in the course is Tracks 
    - This is the instructor because has some familiarity with it
    - There’s a lot of scope for testing. 
    - Tracks is an open source To Do management system where you create actions, next actions
      - Then you put them into context i.e, Where are you going to do them?
      - You can create projects for them and you can set reminders 
        - It is a ToDo app based on Getting Things Done methodology by Dave Allen. 
        - It is a very useful open source app 
  - Eevery time we approach a different app, an application, we will learn something different. 
  - Most of the time we don’t get to choose what we test because we work in companies,
  - In companies there will be a manager who will choose what we work on. 
  - Some of our skills and experience and domain knowledge will not translate into some applications.
    - This means we will not be suitable people to test that without additional training 
      - Or without offering a risk essentially to the project. 
        - Because we may not know what we are doing.
  - We have to combine the right people at the right time to have the right team mix. 
    - This can be hard when you are in management. 
    - For example someone that you need on a project may not be available
  - We have to have some slack in our teams, or we as managers have to have the ability to support people 
    - Or alternatively know that they will be supported on the team. 
  - Sometimes we allocate people to teams because of their soft skills
    - Their personality and how they will fit into that team. 
    - This is a key lesson, we have to choose the right people for the right technology
      - for the right job, otherwise there’s a risk. 
    - Else there is a process that means we have to manage it to make sure that they understand what they were doing. 
    - So that is a tiny, tiny lesson, but it is massive. 
  - What is test management. 
    - Choosing the right person for the job. 
  - What is our career management? 
    - Making sure we have the skills we need for the job. 
    - This is absolutely key to what we do, but at a micro level is choosing a particular application to test.
