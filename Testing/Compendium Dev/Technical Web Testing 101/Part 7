                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 7


Incognito Mode Introduction (Cont)
  - Then login as a different user to test multi-user condtions
    - For example what happens to a document being edited by multiple people simultaneously
  - Login with different privilege levels
    - For example login as admin in the browser and a user in an incognito tab and check how they interact
  - Clean Slate testing 
    - Incognito mode clears cookies and can check if there are problems
  - This should be done in the same browser to avoid that being a factor in tests
  - This type of testing is not performance testing but is event testing
  - There are different terms for this mode in the different browsers
    - Chrome refers to this mode as Incognito mode
      - Available via the tools menu or by right click on a link
    - Firefox refers to this mode as Private mode
      - Available via the tools menu or by right click on a link
    - Both IE and Edge refer to the mode as InPrivate and is available via the tools menu
    - Safari refers to the mode as Private and is available via the tools menu
  - Opera browser has a New Private Window available through tools menu
    - The keyboard shortcut is CTRL|Shift|N
    - There is a VPN option available which can be switched on
    - There is also an option to optimise location
    - Links can be clicked and window behaves much like a normal browser session

Exercise: Incognito Mode Challenges
  - The Incognito Mode Challenges are challenges for the student and are as follows
  - What does the student believe Incognito mode should do
    - Are history, cookies, sessions, bookmarks unique
  - Identify all the ways that you can start Incognito mode for each browser
  - What does Incognito/Private Mode Actually do in each browser
    - Check your beliefs about what incognito mode does 
    - Identify what is shared, and what is unique to the session
  - Have a think about Incognito Mode Features
    - Is there anything missing that you assumed would be there
    - If there is something missing is that a limitation
    - How could the differences in Incognito mode in differing browsers affect testing
      - Was the testing affected by having knowledge about multiple session availability 

Incognito Mode Challenges Slide Retrospective
  - It would be wise to explore for yourself
    - Then look at lessons guiding learning
  - What does each browser actually do with Incognito
    - Versions Used on course
      - Chrome 48
        - No sharing of cookies from incognito to non-incognito mode
        - Lastpass password manager is enabled in both modes, in incognito there will have to be control on each extension
        - Only a single incognito session, so there is the ‘main’ session and an incognito session
          - This can be changed with 3rd party software such as Sandboxie
          - Also this can changed if user profiles are switched
        - There is no history maintained
          - Going to chrome://history/ will jump to the main session window
        - The incognito session and main session share the same proxy settings
        - Dev tools in Chrome will appear almost separate
        - The chrome://downloads/ downloads will show downloads from previous sessions
      - Firefox 43
        - Cookies are not shared between the modes
        - Lastpass is enabled in both the modes
        - A new private session that comes from a private session shares cookies
          - 
        - 
      - IE 11
      - Edge
      - Safari 
  - 

Incognito Mode Challenges Live Example
  - A live demo of the process used by the instructor for finding out the above information
  - Students should do their own research
