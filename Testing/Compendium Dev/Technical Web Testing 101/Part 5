                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 5


An exploratory technical web testing session using chrome (Continued)
  - After signing up for an account
    - On the network tab in the devtools
      - You will be able to see the request being made
    - The network shows that this request is a GET request
      - These can be really easy to change and manipulate with the browser
      - This can be easiest done by just repeating the request
      - It should show that user already exists
    - POST requests are more difficult to resimulate in a browser
    - Looking at manipulating parameters in the URL bar may cause unexpected events to happen
    - There are several different actions that could be used eg delete or amend
      - This can be used in testing
    - There are 2 different ways of looking at traffic, looking at the URL bar and the network tab on the devtools
      - Using the elements tab will allow for digging into the request
  - After checking the signup stuff then check for cookies
    - If there is a tool available to help you use the techniques that you want to use testing
      - Then you should get that tool if possible
  - Technical understanding is important
    - This information will drive assessment of an application
    - For example understanding cookies will drive how to test the web application
    - In the example application the cookie is edited to go from is_author to is_admin
      - This does not login, it meybe a key rather than a state cookie
      - Changing back the cookie and refreshing logs the user back in
    - The application seems to be doing the edit profile from a cookie
      - This may indicate a vulnerability as there is nothing being passed in the URL
      - Changing the cookie may allow for loggin in as someone else
    - The session-id seems to be associated with a person
      - Trying to log in with another user name and is_author does not work
    - The update password form allows uses GET instead of POST
      - This makes life easier for testers but may indicate application issues
  - Testing and experimenting is important
    - It will ensure that you are constantly learning as you go on
  - Updating the URL without a password for the user and setting to is admin
    - This does not cause an error
    - Eaxmining the cookie still shows user set to is_author
    - Logging out and back in will change the user profile
      - There is now a listing for admin&author rather than just author
  - Modern browsers are getting more and more powerful
    - This has replaced some of the functionality of proxies
    - Make full use of the developer tools available
  - It was not tool knowledge that helped
    - Common technical knowledge eg HTTP helped as did curiosity
    - Investigation will help you learn
    - Use HAR files, they are HTTP archive files 


                    Section Intro - View Page Source - A Technical Web Testing Browser Challenge
View Page Source Introduction
  - View Page Source is a very powerful, but under used feature of browsers
  - It seems simple but what can a tester do with this feature
  - This is the first place in a browser that a tester can access the raw source 
  - This source differs from the rendered source seen in the DOM view
    - It is essentially the code you will see if capturing information in a proxy
  - Testers should use this area to develop their understanding of HTML
    - If a tester is short on HTML testing there maybe misdirected testing
    - Also how could a tester understand GUI risks if they do not understand the system they are going to test
    - Looking at page source will show what tags are in use
    - Testers should understand what goes into the Head and Body Sections and the difference
    - Understand what the different tags do and how they impact the page eg functionality, risk etc 
    - Some tags have both a rendering and a functional ability
      - This may change between different browsers
    - This can lead to situations where it is the browser rather than the elements that get tested
  - Understanding HTML halps avoid confusing browser functionality with application functionality
    - One item that may cause confusion is the HTML5 date tags
    - This may cause some testers to assume JavaScript is involved somewhere
  - If a tag has a JS event listener on it then testing the interaction should be done
    - The view source might show some events and their interactions which need testing
    - There are other methods to setting up event listeners so you may not see the interactions
    - They should be the first place to look and are the simplest event listeners to test
  - It is important for a tester to understand the page functionality
