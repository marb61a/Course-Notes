                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 6


Exercise: View Page Source Challenges
  - The challenge in this section is to Find and use the View Page Source functionality
  - For each browser, identify how to access the View Page Source functionality
  - There are different approaches and each tester will have a preference
  - Then Compare the functionality of the different browsers View Page Source
    - What are the differences that you noticed
    - It is a good idea to write these down so as to remember where each may be of use
    - These will also evolve over time so doing the checks every so often may be of benefit
  - Ask how might the differences help your testing
    - Answering this sets you on your way to gaining an edge over other testers and developers
    - Identify alternative functionality for something do not just rely on what something is supposed to do
      - A lot of people do this and don't see what an application can do
  - Always try and identify gaps in your knowledge
    - Time shouuld then be spent plugging those gaps where possible
  - Find some reference sites that will help understand what  HTML tags and other HTML, CSS, JS commands and syntax mean
  - A tester get in the habit of looking for their own answers

View Page Source Challenge Slide Retrospective
  - Compare Functionality to find Differences Between Browsers
  - To get to the source page
    - All browsers have the right click action available
    - This is the only action available in Edge as Ctrl|U does not work
    - IE has a menu option for View -> source
      - Opera has the option under Developer -> View Source
    - Firefox allows for adding view:source instead of http:// to the beginning of a url
  - All browsers have color coding for syntax
  - IE (11)
    - The view source is very basic similar to a notepad view
    - There are no clickable links in the source
      - This means links will have to be pasted into the address bar
    - Find is a dialog which may make it a little more difficult to use
  - Chrome
    - Using find in Chrome will show all matches in the scroll bar
      - This should make it easier to find the items being searched for
    - When using the inspect functionality Chrome uses the DOM view
      - Again this should make finding things like differences easier
