Overview of Firebug in Firefox
  - Using the inbuilt tools for inspecting may not be good
    - At the time of recording the native Firefox dev tools were inferior to Chrome
    - The instructor recommended using an addon Firefox to help testing
    - Firebug has since been discontinued and the newer versions of Firefox have much better inbuilt tools
   - A lot of tools have been built with observation in mind
    - Some features allow for simulate interaction with elements
    - This is still not as good as using a proxy server

Firefox WebConsole
  - Using the Firebug tool
    - Now deprecated
    - The inbuilt tools have now improved to make Firebug obsolete

Google Chrome Incognito Mode
  - Incognito can be reached via the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the browser
    - The keyboard short cut is CTRL|SHIFT|N
    - Incognito does not track cookies etc
    - You will see a spy icon to tell you that you are in Incognito mode
  - Using Incognito allows comparing when logged in versus not logged in
    - You can be logged into a site in a normal tab, Incognito will show you as not being logged in
  - Incognito allows for access to browser history
    - Visiting sites in this mode will not add them to the browser history
  - Extensions are allowed to be used in Incognito mode 
    - They do however have to be explicitly allowed to do so
  - Cookies are not shared among Incognito windows
    - Each window only has the cookies for the sites it has visited
    - The can share a previous history which can be useful for testing

Google Chrome Editing Cookies 
  - The use of cookies for Technical tesing is very important
  - Websites put a lot of functionality into their cookies
    - This is why it is important to be able to manipulate that functionality
  - To bring up the developer tools, either right click and inspect element
    - Or the keyboard shortcut is CTRL|SHIFT|I
  - In the resources tab the cookies can be accessed
  - Chrome allows through right clicking to either refresh or delete the cookie
    - Refresh will check if there has been an update
  - You cannot edit the cookie manually, out of the box
    - In the Chrome Store though there are options
      - In the apps section there is an app called cookies
      - In the extensions section there is an extension called Edit This Cookie
    - There is some overlap in the functionality both provide
    - However in order to be able to have the needed functionality
      - It is recommended to use both 
    - The cookies app only appears in the right click menu with edit cookies
    - The extension appears in both the right click menu and the extensions toolbar
  - Editing the cookies will bring up a new tab
    - This will be populated with existing cookies you have
    - You will need to filter to find the cookie you are looking for
  - You can add cookies
    - In order to add a cookie for a domain, there needs to be one there already
      - The name should be unique 
    - Alternatively rename a cookie from a different site
  - Thd cookie addon is good for adding cookies
    - It is not that good for amending cookies
  - This is why the 2 in combination are much more useful
