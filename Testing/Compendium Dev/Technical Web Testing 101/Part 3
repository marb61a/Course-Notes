                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 3


Google Chrome Incognito Mode
  - Incognito can be reached via the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the browser
    - The keyboard short cut is CTRL|SHIFT|N
    - Incognito does not track cookies etc
    - You will see a spy icon to tell you that you are in Incognito mode
  - Using Incognito allows comparing when logged in versus not logged in
    - You can be logged into a site in a normal tab, Incognito will show you as not being logged in
  - Incognito allows for access to browser history
    - Visiting sites in this mode will not add them to the browser history
  - Extensions are allowed to be used in Incognito mode 
    - They do however have to be explicitly allowed to do so
  - Cookies are not shared among Incognito windows
    - Each window only has the cookies for the sites it has visited
    - The can share a previous history which can be useful for testing

Google Chrome Editing Cookies 
  - The use of cookies for Technical tesing is very important
  - Websites put a lot of functionality into their cookies
    - This is why it is important to be able to manipulate that functionality
  - To bring up the developer tools, either right click and inspect element
    - Or the keyboard shortcut is CTRL|SHIFT|I
  - In the resources tab the cookies can be accessed
  - Chrome allows through right clicking to either refresh or delete the cookie
    - Refresh will check if there has been an update
  - You cannot edit the cookie manually, out of the box
    - In the Chrome Store though there are options
      - In the apps section there is an app called cookies
      - In the extensions section there is an extension called Edit This Cookie
    - There is some overlap in the functionality both provide
    - However in order to be able to have the needed functionality
      - It is recommended to use both 
    - The cookies app only appears in the right click menu with edit cookies
    - The extension appears in both the right click menu and the extensions toolbar
  - Editing the cookies will bring up a new tab
    - This will be populated with existing cookies you have
    - You will need to filter to find the cookie you are looking for
  - You can add cookies
    - In order to add a cookie for a domain, there needs to be one there already
      - The name should be unique 
    - Alternatively rename a cookie from a different site
  - Thd cookie addon is good for adding cookies
    - It is not that good for amending cookies
  - This is why the 2 in combination are much more useful



An exploratory technical web testing session using chrome
  - There are an entire set of notes available for students on this test session
  - This will be done on the Gruyere application from above
    - Testing with Gruyere with Google Chrome
    - This app exists for experimentation
      - Although meant for hacking, it will help testers learn too
  - The functionality is not that important
  - This video can be thought of as a pair testing exercise
    - This is you and the instructor
  - The first thing is to setup an instance of the application
  - Before signing up using the signup form it is important to inspect
    - This is done using the devtools on the form element
    - You should get a look at the DOM broswer
  - There is a bug in the signup form
    - The form method is listed as being GET
    - Form methods are usually POST
      - Particularly sign-up forms
      - This is both a bug and a vulnerability for security testing
    - There maybe a second bug present on the form
      - There is a hidden field which is set to is_author
        - Setting it to is_admin may allow for logging in as an admin
  - Using the devtools will allow for changing values in the DOM
    - There is no need to use breakpoints
    - This can be sent through using submit
      - This has replaced some Proxy functionality
      - Always save the logs
  - After signing up for an account
    - On the network tab in the devtools
      - You will be able to see the request being made
    - The network shows that this request is a GET request
      - These can be really easy to change and manipulate with the browser
      - This can be easiest done by just repeating the request
      - It should show that user already exists
    - POST requests are more difficult to resimulate in a browser
    - Looking at manipulating parameters in the URL bar may cause unexpected events to happen
    - There are several different actions that could be used eg delete or amend
      - This can be used in testing
    - There are 2 different ways of looking at traffic, looking at the URL bar and the network tab on the devtools
      - Using the elements tab will allow for digging into the request
  - After checking the signup stuff then check for cookies
    - If there is a tool available to help you use the techniques that you want to use testing
      - Then you should get that tool if possible
  - Technical understanding is important
    - This information will drive assessment of an application
    - For example understanding cookies will drive how to test the web application
    - In the example application the cookie is edited to go from is_author to is_admin
      - This does not login, it meybe a key rather than a state cookie
      - Changing back the cookie and refreshing logs the user back in
    - The application seems to be doing the edit profile from a cookie
      - This may indicate a vulnerability as there is nothing being passed in the URL
      - Changing the cookie may allow for loggin in as someone else
    - The session-id seems to be associated with a person
      - Trying to log in with another user name and is_author does not work
    - The update password form allows uses GET instead of POST
      - This makes life easier for testers but may indicate application issues
  - Testing and experimenting is important
    - It will ensure that you are constantly learning as you go on
  - Updating the URL without a password for the user and setting to is admin
    - This does not cause an error
    - Eaxmining the cookie still shows user set to is_author
    - Logging out and back in will change the user profile
      - There is now a listing for admin&author rather than just author
  - Modern browsers are getting more and more powerful
    - This has replaced some of the functionality of proxies
    - Make full use of the developer tools available
  - It was not tool knowledge that helped
    - Common technical knowledge eg HTTP helped as did curiosity
    - Investigation will help you learn
    - Use HAR files, they are HTTP archive files
