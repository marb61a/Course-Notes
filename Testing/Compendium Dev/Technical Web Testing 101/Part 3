Google Chrome Elements DOM View
  - Selecting an Element to inspect
    - Will open up dev tools on the elements tab with the specific element highlighted
  - Clicking an element will highlight it on the screen
    - This will show how the HTML is rendered on the screen
    - This is a very good way to learn HTML
    - The CSS can also be edited which can help understand CSS bugs
  - There is an option available to go to specific elements in the dev tools
  - The element view is the DOM view
    - DOM -- Document Object Model
      - This is the interpretation of the HTML that has been sent from the server
  - Using the node capture screenshots utility can be very helpful working with elements
  - The DOM can be observed
    - An example is a website clock where upon inspection the changes can be seen
    - This can be very useful where there is doubt about the interaction point
    - Freezing on the subtreee modifications will be up the JS where the changes happen
      - Remove the breakpoint when finished
  - CSS selectors can be important when automating the applications
    - They are also useful understanding CSS pages
  - Xpath selectors can also be found if they are being used
    - This will allow for searching for elements of different types eg DIV's
    - This will allow for searching the page in different ways
    - There is no limitation to text anymore
      - Complicated Xpath and CSS queries can be used
      - This allows for these elements to be monitored and interrogated in more detail
  - The page can also be manipulated in addition to being monitored and interrogated
    - This can be items such as changing titles etc
    - How will these changes affect the page rendering
    - There are a variety of things that can be tried
      - Deleting or changing elements, changing HTML or CSS
      - Changing how forms work eg colour can be tried to see how validation occurs
        - This can be done to see how things react when either a wrong or no colour is returned 
      - Testers should never trust the GUI and the messages it sends to the server
        - This is because there are a large amount of injection points available
  - Right clicking on an element
    - This will allow adding an attribute eg style
      - For example adding display:none to a style element will make it vanish
    - This may also change or affect the page functionality
      - For exmaple changing the JS that is called with an onclick function
  - The Copy command
    - There are several options available under copy after right-clicking an element

Google Chrome Network Tab

Overview of Firebug in Firefox
  - Using the inbuilt tools for inspecting may not be good
    - At the time of recording the native Firefox dev tools were inferior to Chrome
    - The instructor recommended using an addon Firefox to help testing
    - Firebug has since been discontinued and the newer versions of Firefox have much better inbuilt tools
   - A lot of tools have been built with observation in mind
    - Some features allow for simulate interaction with elements
    - This is still not as good as using a proxy server

Firefox WebConsole
  - Using the Firebug tool
    - Now deprecated
    - The inbuilt tools have now improved to make Firebug obsolete

Google Chrome Incognito Mode
  - Incognito can be reached via the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the browser
    - The keyboard short cut is CTRL|SHIFT|N
    - Incognito does not track cookies etc
    - You will see a spy icon to tell you that you are in Incognito mode
  - Using Incognito allows comparing when logged in versus not logged in
    - You can be logged into a site in a normal tab, Incognito will show you as not being logged in
  - Incognito allows for access to browser history
    - Visiting sites in this mode will not add them to the browser history
  - Extensions are allowed to be used in Incognito mode 
    - They do however have to be explicitly allowed to do so
  - Cookies are not shared among Incognito windows
    - Each window only has the cookies for the sites it has visited
    - The can share a previous history which can be useful for testing
