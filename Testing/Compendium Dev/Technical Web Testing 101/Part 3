                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 3


An exploratory technical web testing session using chrome (Cont..)
  - There is a bug in the signup form
    - The form method is listed as being GET
    - Form methods are usually POST
      - Particularly sign-up forms
      - This is both a bug and a vulnerability for security testing
    - There maybe a second bug present on the form
      - There is a hidden field which is set to is_author
        - Setting it to is_admin may allow for logging in as an admin
  - Using the devtools will allow for changing values in the DOM
    - There is no need to use breakpoints
    - This can be sent through using submit
      - This has replaced some Proxy functionality
      - Always save the logs
  - After signing up for an account
    - On the network tab in the devtools
      - You will be able to see the request being made
    - The network shows that this request is a GET request
      - These can be really easy to change and manipulate with the browser
      - This can be easiest done by just repeating the request
      - It should show that user already exists
    - POST requests are more difficult to resimulate in a browser
    - Looking at manipulating parameters in the URL bar may cause unexpected events to happen
    - There are several different actions that could be used eg delete or amend
      - This can be used in testing
    - There are 2 different ways of looking at traffic, looking at the URL bar and the network tab on the devtools
      - Using the elements tab will allow for digging into the request
  - After checking the signup stuff then check for cookies
    - If there is a tool available to help you use the techniques that you want to use testing
      - Then you should get that tool if possible
  - Technical understanding is important
    - This information will drive assessment of an application
    - For example understanding cookies will drive how to test the web application
    - In the example application the cookie is edited to go from is_author to is_admin
      - This does not login, it meybe a key rather than a state cookie
      - Changing back the cookie and refreshing logs the user back in
    - The application seems to be doing the edit profile from a cookie
      - This may indicate a vulnerability as there is nothing being passed in the URL
    - The session-id seems to be associated with a persone
      - Trying to log in with another user name and is_author does not work
    - The update password form allows uses GET instead of POST
      - This makes life easier for testers but may indicate application issues
  - Testing and experimenting is important
    - It will ensure that you are constantly learning as you go on
