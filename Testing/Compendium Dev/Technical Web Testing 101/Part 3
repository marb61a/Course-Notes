Google Chrome Elements DOM View
  - Selecting an Element to inspect
    - Will open up dev tools on the elements tab with the specific element highlighted
  - Clicking an element will highlight it on the screen
    - This will show how the HTML is rendered on the screen
    - This is a very good way to learn HTML
    - The CSS can also be edited which can help understand CSS bugs
  - There is an option available to go to specific elements in the dev tools
  - The element view is the DOM view
    - DOM -- Document Object Model
      - This is the interpretation of the HTML that has been sent from the server
  - Using the node capture screenshots utility can be very helpful working with elements
  - The DOM can be observed
    - An example is a website clock where upon inspection the changes can be seen
    - This can be very useful where there is doubt about the interaction point
    - Freezing on the subtreee modifications will be up the JS where the changes happen
      - Remove the breakpoint when finished
  - CSS selectors can be important when automating the applications
    - They are also useful understanding CSS pages
  - Xpath selectors can also be found if they are being used
    - This will allow for searching for elements of different types eg DIV's
    - This will allow for searching the page in different ways
    - There is no limitation to text anymore
      - Complicated Xpath and CSS queries can be used
      - This allows for these elements to be monitored and interrogated in more detail
  - The page can also be manipulated in addition to being monitored and interrogated
    - This can be items such as changing titles etc
    - How will these changes affect the page rendering
    - There are a variety of things that can be tried
      - Deleting or changing elements, changing HTML or CSS
      - Changing how forms work eg colour can be tried to see how validation occurs
        - This can be done to see how things react when either a wrong or no colour is returned 
      - Testers should never trust the GUI and the messages it sends to the server
        - This is because there are a large amount of injection points available
  - Right clicking on an element
    - This will allow adding an attribute eg style
      - For example adding display:none to a style element will make it vanish
    - This may also change or affect the page functionality
      - For exmaple changing the JS that is called with an onclick function
  - The Copy command
    - There are several options available under copy after right-clicking an element
    - Copying the selector can be a good option
      - It will allow to be pasted into the box and optimised to see if the same element is still reached
      - This will allow for learning better CSS selection
  - The Force State option can be useful
    - This can be done in 2 ways either the element or css view
    - For example on a hover driven drop-down menu which can be awkward to test
      - Simply find the element and force state to be hover
      - This allows for scrolling and screenshots without the menu disappearing
  - Scroll into view can be useful if working at the DOM level
  - The Store As Global variable option can help with JavaScript
    - If changing some settings in JS then the orignal can be hard to remember
    - This is where you could use ths option
  - The media queries toolbar will help when testing responsive sites
    - When dealing with media query driven changes
  - The obvious place to start technical testing is on the elements tab
    - This is because this is the place where elements can be altered or removed and then check how the server handles it
    - For example in a drop down menu change the 3rd of 3 options to number 4 and see what errors occur if any
  - There are different tags for different HTML versions
    - This means a possible risk for older browsers
  - Complicated CSS may be a risk on some devices
    - There may be issues with rendering in places
