Absolute Basics
Absolute Basics
- Technical testing is not
  - Tools, Techniques or Automation etc
  - These are side effectsand stem from learning, exploration, attitude etc
  - The course will cover tools but this is because the learning can be done from the tool
    - Tool -- Function informs the technique
    - Learning -- The technique finds function
    - This is a circular loop and there is no easy point of entry

Should you maintain a Tool List? 
  - The author does not maintain a list of his tools anymore
  - This stopped happening because of how easy information is available
  - This is not to discourage anyone from having a list
  - Should people have a list
    - Some people possibly should
    - It may be an advantage for people new to testing
    - It also might help when using tools for specific environments
    - Current tools eg toolset 
    - Generic tools lists are not helpful 
      - Tool lists should have a purpose

The MORIM model
  - The MORIM loop
  - An acronym standing for 
    - Model, Observe, Reflect, Interrogate and Manipulate
