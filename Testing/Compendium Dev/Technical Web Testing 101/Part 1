                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 1


Welcome
Introduction
  - Brief intro to the instructor
  - Introduction to the process the instructor follows in projects
  - Test fundamentals do not change
    - Technology does however eg development languages
  - Use tools to augment testing not control it


Absolute Basics
Absolute Basics
- Technical testing is not
  - Tools, Techniques or Automation etc
  - These are side effectsand stem from learning, exploration, attitude etc
  - The course will cover tools but this is because the learning can be done from the tool
    - Tool -- Function informs the technique
    - Learning -- The technique finds function
    - This is a circular loop and there is no easy point of entry

Should you maintain a Tool List? 
  - The author does not maintain a list of his tools anymore
  - This stopped happening because of how easy information is available
  - This is not to discourage anyone from having a list
  - Should people have a list
    - Some people possibly should
    - It may be an advantage for people new to testing
    - It also might help when using tools for specific environments
    - Current tools eg toolset 
    - Generic tools lists are not helpful 
      - Tool lists should have a purpose

The MORIM model
  - The MORIM loop
  - An acronym standing for 
    - Model, Observe, Reflect, Interrogate and Manipulate
  - Be careful as this is the instructors mental model
  - Model
    - Build a model which is layered of the functionality, flows and tech usage of an application
  - Observe
    - When testing you will need to be able to observe certain things
      - At each layer what can you see
      - Can you increase the depth of these observations
      - Do you understand what you see
      - Are there other things which could be observed
  - Reflect
    - When testing you should be able to reflect on observations
    - Analyse any observations you have made
    - Undersatnd what the implcations for these observations are
    - Are there others to be observed, what are the risks involved and can circumstances change these
  - Interrogate
    - At some point you will need to dive into the data of your observations
    - Use breakpoints to help
    - Correlate data changes with state
  - Manipulate
    - It is not testing unless it can be manipulated
    - Change the state and edit the communications
    - Change the environment context, memory etc
Morim Utilisation
  - Repeat the process as needed
  - You can do the process in any order
  - Decide deliberately what to do next
  - Do it and take advantage of what happens
