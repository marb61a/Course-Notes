                    Course Notes Part 9


Configure Firefox to Use BurpSuite Proxy
  - Will need to download BurpSuite
    - https://portswigger.net/burp
    - This is a paid product but there is a free community edition available
      - Depending on the testing the free version maybe enough
    - To install Java must be installed
    - You should explore the UI of BurpSuite to get an understanding of the tool
    - On the proxy tab set the intercept option to off
      - This means that any request sent will go through BurpSuite so turn off
    - On the Options tab you can set listeners
      - They will be on 127/0/0/1:<port_number> and there can be more than 1
      - You can set FireFox to use the proxy to connect to the internet
        - Go into preferences -> Network settings -> settings and setup address and port
        - This will use the manual configuration option
        - Ensure that the proxy and browser point to the same address and port number
        - You can use the proxy for different protocols

Basics of BurpSuite
  - When searching for the first time there will be an error
    - This is because the search will go through HTTPS
    - A certificate will be sent by the proxy rather than Google which causes the error and an exception will need to be added to allow the search
  - You may need to delete the exceptions granted at some point
  - The history tab in Burp Suite will show what requests were made in the search
  - The responses contain a lot of information and can be a great learning tool
    - Between the requests and responses there are several ways of viewing the information which can help with different things
  - The target tab in Burp Suite will perform passive scanning during searches
    - This means that a google search will pick up google maps info and others too

Repeating a Request in BurpSuite
  - You can right click on a request to send the request to the repeater
  - This will add the repeater tab and a simple click of the go button present wlll repeat the listed request
    - This can be used to change\amend the request
  - You will not see the repeated request due to repeater being self contained

Intercepting and manipulating requests
  - Turning the intercept option back on
    - This will be seen in the intercept tab
    - You can setup intercept on specific file types eg css, js and different types of image files
    - Sending a request from the intercept tab will show in  history and browser
      - This can be done by clicking the forward button, the drop button will remove the request
  - Using proxies will allow testers to see traffic and the different parts of the traffic
  - You can also use intercept to change responses 

Generic Configure Browser to use a proxy
  - You must configure your browser to use a proxy

An Introduction to Interactive REST API Testing
Introduction
  - The section will show how to test a REST API
  - It will be mostly practical with not that much theory
  - It will involve using the RestMud game

What is REST? 
  - Stands for REpresentational State Transfer
  - It is an API (Application Programming Interface) using HTTP calls where the HTTP verbs dictate the actions
    - And the URI is the thing to act on, a URI is essentially a browser URL
      - There are formal differences but for practicality they can be thought of as the same
    - The main verbs are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  - In REST theory each call is stateless and cacheable
    - This is not always the case
  - When most people talk about a REST API they usually mean an API accessible via HTTP
    - This is on URL's using either JSON or XML on the message or response data
      - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    - This is what the course will focus on whether it is a REST API or not
  - The API used in the course is the Randomser.me API
    - https://randomuser.me/
    - A free, open-source API for generating random user data. Like Lorem Ipsum, but for people.
    - This will use GET requests on the API
    - GET requests can be sent through the browser
    - The example query parameters use nationality and gender
  - HTTP is either a scheme or protocol name
    - The double slash separator is important in HTTP
    - A query string starts with ?
    - Variables are in the form of key=value
    - Variables are separated using an ampersand (&)
