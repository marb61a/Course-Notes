                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 4
                    

Google Chrome Network Tab (Continued)
  - This will allow for repeatedly running a request in the console
  - There is no option in the right click menu for repeating a request but the cURL option does this
  - How the application handles errors can be tested by blocking requests
    - This can be done by selcting the block request option
    - Then reload the page and watch the panel as the page is loaded, there will be request blocked messages
    - In real applications this will make a difference
    - Error handling is usually hidden by the application
      - This knowledge is good to know and hard to test
  - The network tab is good for lightweight observation of what is happenning
  - This is good as there is no additional tooling needed eg proxies
  - You can see what happens when sending bad requests to the server
    - Reusing the number 4 option in a 3 option menu, you should get no response data
    - The console will likely have an unexpected end of JSON input error
    - There maybe a 200 code returned meaning it is OK but it is just empty

Overview of Firebug in Firefox
  - Using the inbuilt tools for inspecting may not be good
    - At the time of recording the native Firefox dev tools were inferior to Chrome
    - The instructor recommended using an addon Firefox to help testing
    - Firebug has since been discontinued and the newer versions of Firefox have much better inbuilt tools
   - A lot of tools have been built with observation in mind
    - Some features allow for simulate interaction with elements
    - This is still not as good as using a proxy server

Firefox WebConsole
  - Using the Firebug tool
    - Now deprecated
    - The inbuilt tools have now improved to make Firebug obsolete

Google Chrome Incognito Mode
  - Incognito can be reached via the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the browser
    - The keyboard short cut is CTRL|SHIFT|N
    - Incognito does not track cookies etc
    - You will see a spy icon to tell you that you are in Incognito mode
  - Using Incognito allows comparing when logged in versus not logged in
    - You can be logged into a site in a normal tab, Incognito will show you as not being logged in
  - Incognito allows for access to browser history
    - Visiting sites in this mode will not add them to the browser history
  - Extensions are allowed to be used in Incognito mode 
    - They do however have to be explicitly allowed to do so
  - Cookies are not shared among Incognito windows
    - Each window only has the cookies for the sites it has visited
    - The can share a previous history which can be useful for testing


Google Chrome Editing Cookies 
  - The use of cookies for Technical tesing is very important
  - Websites put a lot of functionality into their cookies
    - This is why it is important to be able to manipulate that functionality
  - To bring up the developer tools, either right click and inspect element
    - Or the keyboard shortcut is CTRL|SHIFT|I
  - In the resources tab the cookies can be accessed
  - Chrome allows through right clicking to either refresh or delete the cookie
    - Refresh will check if there has been an update
  - You cannot edit the cookie manually, out of the box
    - In the Chrome Store though there are options
      - In the apps section there is an app called cookies
      - In the extensions section there is an extension called Edit This Cookie
    - There is some overlap in the functionality both provide
    - However in order to be able to have the needed functionality
      - It is recommended to use both 
    - The cookies app only appears in the right click menu with edit cookies
    - The extension appears in both the right click menu and the extensions toolbar
  - Editing the cookies will bring up a new tab
    - This will be populated with existing cookies you have
    - You will need to filter to find the cookie you are looking for
  - You can add cookies
    - In order to add a cookie for a domain, there needs to be one there already
      - The name should be unique 
    - Alternatively rename a cookie from a different site
  - Thd cookie addon is good for adding cookies
    - It is not that good for amending cookies
  - This is why the 2 in combination are much more useful

An exploratory technical web testing session using chrome
  - There are an entire set of notes available for students on this test session
  - This will be done on the Gruyere application from above
    - Testing with Gruyere with Google Chrome
    - This app exists for experimentation
      - Although meant for hacking, it will help testers learn too
  - The functionality is not that important
  - This video can be thought of as a pair testing exercise
    - This is you and the instructor
  - The first thing is to setup an instance of the application
  - Before signing up using the signup form it is important to inspect
    - This is done using the devtools on the form element
    - You should get a look at the DOM broswer
  - There is a bug in the signup form
    - The form method is listed as being GET
    - Form methods are usually POST
      - Particularly sign-up forms
      - This is both a bug and a vulnerability for security testing
    - There maybe a second bug present on the form
      - There is a hidden field which is set to is_author
        - Setting it to is_admin may allow for logging in as an admin
  - Using the devtools will allow for changing values in the DOM
    - There is no need to use breakpoints
    - This can be sent through using submit
      - This has replaced some Proxy functionality
      - Always save the logs
