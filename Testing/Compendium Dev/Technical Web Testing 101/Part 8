    - This assumes that you have java installed and added to the path to allow programs to be run
      - The game needs at least Java 8, use java --version to check, if necessary update

HTTP Proxies   
Introduction to HTTP Proxies
  - Brief intro to the instruuctor and module

What is an HTTP Proxy?
  - A HTTP proxy is a piece of software that sits between the browser and the server
  - You will then route all requests through the proxy
    - The flows is as follows
      Browser -> Request -> Proxy -> Server
      Browser <- Proxy <- Response <- Server
    - This can be a great way of learning about HTTP and what is going on in the application
  - HTTPS is handled by man in the middle certificate use
    - In this case the proxy sends the certificate back to the browser for validation
    - Once the broswer has validated as either good or bad
  - The tester should care about this material to learn as much about the app and technology involved in testing
    - The tester will need to learn many different things
      - HTTP including the various headers and what they do
      - JSON, how it is used, formatted and works 
      - Application architecture is very important to learn
        - Proxies will give a site map which shows how the app has been built up
      - Being able to observe and then manipulate web traffic is essential for a tester
      - Simulate different network speeds will be allowed by some proxies
        - If you need to check how the app performs under lower bandwidth this is how
      - Simulating different browsers from a single browser by changing HTTP headers
        - Each browser identifies itself to the server using HTTP headers
        - These can be changed and it is down to each tester how they would use this
      - You can test CSS and JS without relesing to the main site
        - A proxy an be used to pull from a local drive and then ran against the old css on the server 
      - JavaScript (clientside) can be tested fro various error conditions
        - This includes the different 4XX and 5XX errors
        - This can be done by amending repsonses using the proxy in various ways
