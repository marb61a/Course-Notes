HTTP Proxies   
Introduction to HTTP Proxies
  - Brief intro to the instruuctor and module

What is an HTTP Proxy?
  - A HTTP proxy is a piece of software that sits between the browser and the server
  - You will then route all requests through the proxy
    - The flows is as follows
      Browser -> Request -> Proxy -> Server
      Browser <- Proxy <- Response <- Server
    - This can be a great way of learning about HTTP and what is going on in the application
  - HTTPS is handled by man in the middle certificate use
    - In this case the proxy sends the certificate back to the browser for validation
    - Once the broswer has validated as either good or bad
