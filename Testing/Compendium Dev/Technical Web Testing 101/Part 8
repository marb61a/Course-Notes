HTTP Proxies   
Introduction to HTTP Proxies
  - Brief intro to the instruuctor and module

What is an HTTP Proxy?
  - A HTTP proxy is a piece of software that sits between the browser and the server
  - You will then route all requests through the proxy
    - The flows is as follows
      Browser -> Request -> Proxy -> Server
      Browser <- Proxy <- Response <- Server
    - This can be a great way of learning about HTTP and what is going on in the application
  - HTTPS is handled by man in the middle certificate use
    - In this case the proxy sends the certificate back to the browser for validation
    - Once the broswer has validated as either good or bad

An Introduction to Interactive REST API Testing
Introduction
  - The section will show how to test a REST API
  - It will be mostly practical with not that much theory
  - It will involve using the RestMud game

What is REST? 
  - Stands for REpresentational State Transfer
  - It is an API (Application Programming Interface) using HTTP calls where the HTTP verbs dictate the actions
    - And the URI is the thing to act on, a URI is essentially a browser URL
      - There are formal differences but for practicality they can be thought of as the same
    - The main verbs are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  - In REST theory each call is stateless and cacheable
    - This is not always the case
  - When most people talk about a REST API they usually mean an API accessible via HTTP
    - This is on URL's using either JSON or XML on the message or response data
      - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    - This is what the course will focus on whether it is a REST API or not
  - The API used in the course is the Randomser.me API
    - https://randomuser.me/
    - A free, open-source API for generating random user data. Like Lorem Ipsum, but for people.
    - This will use GET requests on the API
    - GET requests can be sent through the browser
    - The example query parameters use nationality and gender
  - HTTP is either a scheme or protocol name
    - The double slash separator is important in HTTP
    - A query string starts with ?
    - Variables are in the form of key=value
    - Variables are separated using an ampersand (&)

Exercise: Explore a REST API using a Browser
  - The exercise will use the RandomUser API
  - There is a series of challenges for students to do 
    - Instruction can be found in the site documentation
      - https://randomuser.me/documentation
     
Exercise Answers: Explore a REST API using a Browser
  - The challenges and results are as follows
  - Challenge -- Get 10 random people from Germany
    - Result -- https://randomuser.me/api/?nat=de&results=10
  - Challenge -- Get 2 random males from France
    - Result -- https://randomuser.me/api/?nat=fr&results=2&gender=m
  - Challenge -- Get name, email and phone number for 25 people
    - Result -- https://randomuser.me/api/?inc=name,email,phone&results=25
  - Challenge -- Get results as a csv list
    - Result -- https://randomuser.me/api/?inc=name,email,phone&results=25&format=csv
  - The instructors results are the same apart from the ordering of the queries
    - Ordering of query parameters should not affect an application
    - If there are issues then it may be something else in the application causing an issue
