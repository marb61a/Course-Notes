What is an HTTP Proxy?
  - A HTTP proxy is a piece of software that sits between the browser and the server
  - You will then route all requests through the proxy
    - The flows is as follows
      Browser -> Request -> Proxy -> Server
      Browser <- Proxy <- Response <- Server
    - This can be a great way of learning about HTTP and what is going on in the application
  - HTTPS is handled by man in the middle certificate use
