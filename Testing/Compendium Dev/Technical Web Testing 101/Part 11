A Little More REST Theory 
  - HTTP verbs dictate the action in CRUD model
    - CRUD            HTTP Verb               Description
      Create          POST                    Insert Data
      Read            GET                     Retrieve Data
      Update          PUT                     Amend Data
      Delete          DELETE                  Delete Data
  - HTTP Return Codes tell whether a request was successful or not
    - Code          Description
      1xx           Information Message
      2xx           Action Successful
      3xx           Redirection Response
      4xx           Client Error -- Error in Request
      5xx           Server Error -- Error processing Request
  - There is a list of HTTP codes available at the following address
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
