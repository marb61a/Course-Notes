                    Course Notes Part 1



Applications to use for Testing
Some free online applications to test against
  - You can use some free apps for testing if you do not have an app of yourself
  - A lot of these applications are aimed at hackers and security testing
    - This is not the aim of this type of testing 
    - There is a very slim line between some types og functionality testing and security testing

  - Recommendations for self study
  - The above applications are highly recommended by the course instructor



Modern Browsers
Intro to Modern Browsers
  - Modern browsers have a lot of functionality to the apps listed above
    - Observe traffic through tools such as Firebug and the developer console
    - Fiddle and tamper with the DOM before use
    - You should explore to see how far you can get
    - This can help if you are unable to install and run a proxy server

Overview of Firebug in Firefox
  - Using the inbuilt tools for inspecting may not be good
    - At the time of recording the native Firefox dev tools were inferior to Chrome
    - The instructor recommended using an addon Firefox to help testing
    - Firebug has since been discontinued and the newer versions of Firefox have much better inbuilt tools
   - A lot of tools have been built with observation in mind
    - Some features allow for simulate interaction with elements
    - This is still not as good as using a proxy server

  - 

Google Chrome Incognito Mode

Google Chrome Editing Cookies (6:36)
