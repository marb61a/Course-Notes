                    Technical Web Testing 101
                    Course Notes Part 1



Applications to use for Testing
Some free online applications to test against
  - You can use some free apps for testing if you do not have an app of yourself
  - A lot of these applications are aimed at hackers and security testing
    - This is not the aim of this type of testing 
    - There is a very slim line between some types og functionality testing and security testing

Self Study Applications to test against
  - Recommendations for self study
  - The above applications are highly recommended by the course instructor



Modern Browsers
Intro to Modern Browsers
  - Modern browsers have a lot of functionality to the apps listed above
    - Observe traffic through tools such as Firebug and the developer console
    - Fiddle and tamper with the DOM before use
    - You should explore to see how far you can get
    - This can help if you are unable to install and run a proxy server

Overview of Firebug in Firefox
  - Using the inbuilt tools for inspecting may not be good
    - At the time of recording the native Firefox dev tools were inferior to Chrome
    - The instructor recommended using an addon Firefox to help testing
    - Firebug has since been discontinued and the newer versions of Firefox have much better inbuilt tools
   - A lot of tools have been built with observation in mind
    - Some features allow for simulate interaction with elements
    - This is still not as good as using a proxy server

Firefox WebConsole
  - Using the Firebug tool
    - Now deprecated
    - The inbuilt tools have now improved to make Firebug obsolete

Google Chrome Incognito Mode
  - Incognito can be reached via the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the browser
    - The keyboard short cut is CTRL|SHIFT|N
    - Incognito does not track cookies etc
    - You will see a spy icon to tell you that you are in Incognito mode
  - Using Incognito allows comparing when logged in versus not logged in
    - You can be logged into a site in a normal tab, Incognito will show you as not being logged in
  - Incognito allows for access to browser history
    - Visiting sites in this mode will not add them to the browser history
  - Extensions are allowed to be used in Incognito mode 
    - They do however have to be explicitly allowed to do so
  - Cookies are not shared among Incognito windows
    - Each window only has the cookies for the sites it has visited
    - The can share a previous history which can be useful for testing

Google Chrome Editing Cookies 
  - The use of cookies for Technical tesing is very important
  - Websites put a lot of functionality into their cookies
    - This is why it is important to be able to manipulate that functionality
  -

An exploratory technical web testing session using chrome
  - There are an entire set of notes available for students on this test session
  - This will be done on the Gruyere application from above
    - Testing with Gruyere with Google Chrome
