                    Software Architecture: Functional Programming in C#
                    Course Notes Part 2


Introduction to Functional Programming
Outline
  - Quick outline of the course and section

Programming Paradigms
  - A lot of developers are not familiar with Functional Programming
  - There are several different programming paradigms
    - Imperative Programming
    - Procedural Programming which is derived from Imperative
    - Declarative Programming
    - Functional Programming
    - Object Oriented Programming
    - Event driven Programming
    - Automata based Programming
  - Functional Programming is not an exotic new trend
    - It is in fact the oldest paradigm at over 60 years old
  - Many programmers use Functional Principles daily without realizing
  - Most languages cater for multipl paradigms
  - Functional Programming was bought into C# in version 3 with LINQ and method extensions
  - Functional Programming enforces immutability of types and operations
