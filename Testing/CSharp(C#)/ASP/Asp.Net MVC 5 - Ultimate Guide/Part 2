ASP.net MVC vs ASP.net Web Forms
  - MVC
    - Supports clean separation of concerns
    - It has a business logic layer and controllers can be unit tested
    - It supports dependency injection
    - It offers faster performance than Web Forms
    - There is no page lifecycle, controls, postback and viewstate
    - Applications run on the principle that the web is stateless
  - Web Forms
    - Presentation Logic (.aspx files) and Event Logic (.aspx.cs files) are tightly coupled
    - Presentation Logic and Application Logic are not unit testable
    - Web Forms do not support dependency injection
    - Is slower running than ASP.net MVC
    - Supports page lifecycle, controls, postback and viewstate
    - Hides statelessness of web and assumes a stateful environment
