Creating a sample standard library function to be reused
  - Using static will stop the need for instantiation
  - Needs to be built before being used in another project
  - This will generate a dll file on the file system
  - Make sure that you know where the file is for referencing

using System;

namespace MyLib1
{
    public static class ClassExampleStand
    {
        public static int MyIntMethodLibFunction(int input)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Happy Days {0}", input);
            return input;
        }

    }
}
