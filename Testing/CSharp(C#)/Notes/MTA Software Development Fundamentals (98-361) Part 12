                      Course Notes
                      MTA Software Development Fundamentals (98-361) Part 12


Windows Services
  - Not an interactive application as the end user rarely directly interacts with a service
  - It is an executable and is designed to specifically not require user involvement
  - They are often configured to start alongside the OS and run in the background
  - These are a good choice when you want to start an app automatically when the OS starts
  - These types of programs do not require a UI
  - They are an especially good choice if using long running functions
    - One example is the printer spooler service in case document printing is needed
 
MDI vs SDI Applications
  - A console application is an SDI Application
  - This is because you can only have 1 instance of the app running


Working With Databases
  - The are an entire set of SQL Server notes at

Database Connection Methods
  - You may need to access data of different types
  - Flat files such as csv separated text files
  - XML (eXtensible Markup Language) files
    - This uses tags similar to HTML to identify the data type of the enclosed information
    - XML is stored in a flat file
    - It is widely used in Web Apps
    - There are 2 separate methods for retrieving data from an XML source
      - CStrreamRowSet commands
      - CXMLAccessor commands
  - An in-memory object
  - It is important to consider resource optimization
    - It may be more efficient to read all data rather than constantly going searching the db
  - When programs need to access and modify data there will need to be a channel set up to allow that to happen
   - This will differ depending on the location and type of data storage
  - To connect to an Orcale, SQL Server or Access DB
    - You will use an OLE (Object Linking and Extraction) DB Connection
    - OLE will allow for accessing different data types uniformly
    - This was designed by Microsoft
