Windows Services
  - Not an interactive application as the end user rarely directly interacts with a service
  - It is an executable and is designed to specifically not require user involvement
  - They are often configured to start alongside the OS and run in the background
  - These are a good choice when you want to start an app automatically when the OS starts
  - These types of programs do not require a UI
  - They are an especially good choice if using long running functions
    - One example is the printer spooler service in case document printing is needed
 
MDI vs SDI Applications
  - A console application is an SDI Application
  - This is because you can only have 1 instance of the app running
