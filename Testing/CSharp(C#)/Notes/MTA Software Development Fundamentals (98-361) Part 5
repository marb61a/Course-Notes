Switch Statements
  - The switch statement is a valuable tool when using more than 1 path for a boolean
  - When assessing multiple values it may be better to use a switch statement than others
  - The syntax is
    switch(variable name)
    {
      case case_name :
        statement(s);
        break;
    }
  - There can be a default statement which is used if no categories match
  - If there is no break statement in a case then it will fall though to the next case
  - There can be many different cases to be checked
  - There can also be nested switch statements

Truth Tables
  - A boolean expression may contain multiple statements to be evaluated
  - Using and the only time an expression will evaluate to true is if both parts are true
  - Using or expression will evaluate to true is if either of the parts are true
                      
Types of Repetition
  - A loop is the most prevalent type of repetition in coding
    - A for loop is when something needs to be executed a known number of times
    - A while loop uses a boolean to determine its duration
    - Do-While loop similar to while but guaranteed to lopp at leaast once
 
Recursion
  - Another type of looping in programming is recursion
  - The main concept in recursion is that a block of code calls itself until it reaches a base case
  - Always identify a base case before commencing coding
    - Failure can cause an infinite recursion problem in your code
  - Two of the most prevalent mistakes when programming are
    - Infinite recursion
    - Infinite loops
  - A simple example is 5! (factorial)
    - This is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 where 1 is the base case
  
Loops
  - There are times where it is necessary to get out of a loop
  - Programs can stop a loop by using the break command
  - If a program decides that it does not want to continue
    - The continue command can then be used to end this loop itereation
    - The program then returns to the start of the loop
