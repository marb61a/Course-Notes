Switch Statements
  - The switch statement is a valuable tool when using more than 1 path for a boolean
  - When assessing multiple values it may be better to use a switch statement than others
  - The syntax is
    switch(variable name)
    {
      case case_name :
        statement(s);
        break;
    }
  - There can be a default statement which is used if no categories match
  - If there is no break statement in a case then it will fall though to the next case
  - There can be many different cases to be checked
  - There can also be nested switch statements
