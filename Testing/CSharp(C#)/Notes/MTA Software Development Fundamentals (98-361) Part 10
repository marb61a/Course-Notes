Client\Server side Programming
  - Client-side is actions that happen when a user enters a browser
  - Server-side is the actions that happen on a server when a request is sent and the returned
  - Typing in a URL(Uniform Resource Locator) or accessing a site via a hyperlink
    - This is how a user finds a desired site
    - The server finds it, opens it and runs the server-side scripts
    - After the scripts are processed the results are sent beck to the browser
    - The results page is created using HTML, CSS and some client-side JavaScript(if needed)
  - Client-side Programming
    - It is limited but provides some interactivity
    - It can be used for things such as data verification
  - Scripting on the client side is done using JavaScript
    - This provides AJAX functionality which is a set of client side techniques to create async web apps
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)
  - Server-side Programming
    - Languages such as PHP, Java, C# and NodeJS are used
