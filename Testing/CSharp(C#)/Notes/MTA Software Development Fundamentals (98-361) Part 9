Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation                      
Inheritance Defined
  - Two similar objects can derive data from a single object
  - The derived class inherits all the functionality with proper access modifiers from the base class
  
Polymorphism Defined
  - Polymorphism is where 2 methods with the same signature act differently based on the class where the methods reside
  - Polymorphism depends on the object type rather than the reference to determine which method to invoke

Polymorphism vs Overloading
  - In overloading the method parameters differ which is not the case with polymorphism

Encapsulation Defined
  - This allows the implementation details to be hidden while still providing access to all data and methods in a class
  - This is sometimes referred to as a black box
  - This allows for self governing
