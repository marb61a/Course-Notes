Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation                      
Inheritance Defined
  - Two similar objects can derive data from a single object
  - The derived class inherits all the functionality with proper access modifiers from the base class
  
Polymorphism Defined
  - Polymorphism is where 2 methods with the same signature act differently based on the class where the methods reside
  - Polymorphism depends on the object type rather than the reference to determine which method to invoke

Polymorphism vs Overloading
  - In overloading the method parameters differ which is not the case with polymorphism

Encapsulation Defined
  - This allows the implementation details to be hidden while still providing access to all data and methods in a class
  - This is sometimes referred to as a black box
  - This allows for self governing
  
  
  
Web Application Development  
Understanding Web Page Development
  - The code used in any web page is either HTML or XHTML
  - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, XHTML for eXtensible HyperText Markup Language
  - HTML provides static content
  - It is used in conjunction with CSS to provide a more rich environment
  - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style web pages
  - CSS separates style from content
  - There are 3 types of stylesheets
    - Internal which are written inside the header of the page
    - Inline which are written alongside the code
    - External which are in a separate file which is called upon
  - JavaScript provides client-side programming to make pages more interactive
    - It is important not to confuse this with Java which is a completely separate language
    - Java is very strongly types language JavaScript is not
  
Microsoft ASP.net Web Development
  - ASP stands for Active Server Pages
  - A website will usually have more than one page
  - Each page will have its own page lifecycle
  - The page lifecycle is the series of steps that a page goes through from creation to disposal
  - When an ASP.net page runs the page performs a series of processing steps
    - Initialisation, Instantiating control, Restoring and maintaining state, Running Event handler code
    - It also controls rendering of the page
  - The ASP event model allows for development of pages that respond to events similar to client applications
    - These include mouseover and mouseout etc
