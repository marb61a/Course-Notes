Aliases
  - When assigning one object to the values of another this makes a second pointer to the same object
  - Using = copies the address to the object that was created in the first part of the statement
  - When assigning one object to another you are creating an alias
  
Creating New Objects
  - Use the class to create instances of the class called objects
  - An object cannot be referenced unless instantiated by using the new operator
  - When the new operator is used the program will find the class definition and use the constructor to set up a new object
  
Comparing Objects
  - Using == compares the aliases
    - This cannot be used to compare primitive data
  - Most languages have a compareTo which can be used to compare objects
    - This allows for object comparison and defining how they are to be compared  

The Dot Operator
  - When a programmer wishes to use the values or methods of an object they use the dot operator
  - You can use the .compareTo for example to compare objects
  - If using the compareTo and the value returned is 0 then the 2 objects are the same
    - comapreTo returns 3 values < 0, 0, >0
    - If the number on the left is less than the right then a negative value is returned, the opposite is also true
    - This can be confusing so looking over examples is recommended
  
Wrapper Classes
  - This is where primitive data is used as an object
  - Example int is a primitive data type but Integer is an object
  - Most primitive types have wrapper classes
  - Converting is called boxing or unboxing
  
Static Classes and Variables
  - There are special types of calss and variables that used the keyword Static
  - When something is Static in a program there is only 1 occurence
    - This is because they do not belong to an instance of a class
  - Static objects do not require using new to create an instance
  - There are several commonly used Static classes
    - Math, Random
  - A Static variable is used when one value is needed for all instances of a class
