Data Types
  - Make sure that you use the most appropriate data type
  - Try using a type that will match closely the minimum and maximum values
  - Use the type that uses as little memory space as possible
  - Some examples are Integer whole numbers or decimal numbers
  - Data Types are not just numbers but words\strings also
  
Primitive Data Types
  - These types are standard across all programming languages
  - Some common examples are byte, int, long, short, char
  - Boolean which takes true or false
  
Data Type Examples
  - Boolean which always is either true or false
  - String for things like names etc
  - Character for something like an initial
  - Double which is something such as decimal etc

Data Storage Type Considerations
  - byte	    Byte	  Unsigned integer	          8	  0 to 255
  - sbyte	    SByte	  Signed integer	            8	  -128 to 127
  - short	    Int16	  Signed integer	            16	-32,768 to 32,767
  - ushort	  UInt16	Unsigned integer	          16	0 to 65,535
  - int	      Int32	  Signed integer	            32	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - uint	    UInt32	Unsigned integer	          32	0 to 4294967295
  - long	    Int64	  Signed integer	            64	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  - ulong	    UInt64	Unsigned integer	          64	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
  - float	    Single	Single-precision fp type	  32	-3.402823e38 to 3.402823e38
  - double	  Double	Double-precision fp type	  64	-1.79769313486232e308 to 1.79769313486232e308
  - decimal	  Decimal	Precise fractional or integral type that can represent decimal numbers with 29 significant digits	128	(+ or -)1.0 x 10e-28 to 7.9 x 10e28
  - char	    Char	  A single Unicode character	16	Unicode symbols used in text
  - bool	    Boolean	Logical Boolean type	      8	True or False
  - object	  Object	Base type of all other types		
  - string	  String	A sequence of characters		
  - DateTime	DateTime	Represents date and time		0:00:00am 1/1/01 to 11:59:59pm 12/31/9999

Understanding Numbering Systems
  - Base 10 - Everyday numbering systeem 0 - 9
  - Base 2 -  Binary system 0 or 1
  - Base 8 -  Octal system 0 - 7
  - Base 16 - Hexidecimal System 0 - 9 and A - F
  - You should know how to convert from one to the other
