Web Services Defined
  - Web Services are used when one app wishes to talk to anoth through the internet
  - In this case a translator may be needed
    - This will provide reusable bits of code
    - Interoperability can happen because of the translation
  - SOAP which stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
    - This is a simple XML based protocol for exchanging structured and type information on the internet
  - WSDL which stands for Web Services Description Language
    - This is an XML format that allows for better interoperability between Web Services and development tools
    - It is written in XML and used to locate a web service and describe its functions
    - It defines the information formats, data types and transport protocols



Desktop Application Development
Windows Forms Applications
  - When creating a Windows application you should use the event model
    - This is the lifecycle of an event
  - Another important concept in creating Windows forms apps is Visual Inheritance
    - This gives the ability to see controls from a base form and add new controls where needed
    - It is a similar approach to the inheritance between classes
  - UI Design is another component of developing applications
    - You need to know who the end user of the application will be
      - Different types of end users will dictate different types of UI
    - Console applications for example may have a command line as the UI
    - Graphic or GUI interfaces allow for media rich applications
    - Menu driven applications will provide a list of items from which a user can select
  - Whether your app will be using MDI platform or SDI platform
    - MDI stands for Multiple Dialog Interfaces
      - This will allow a user to have more than a single window open
      - One example is the side by side view feature from excel where users can have tables open side by side
    - SDI stands for Single Dialog Interfaces
      - This will force a user to complete a single dialog box before moving on to another 

Console Applications\Event Handlers
  - Console apps allow a user to enter information using a DOS screen
  - Windows Forms programming is different than console apps prgogramming
  - Forms are GUI apps and have Event Handlers
    - Event Handlers are procedures in code that determine actions to be performed when a particular action occurs
    - When the event is raised the handlers that receive the handlers are executed
    - Some examples of events are button presses, mouseovers and clicks
