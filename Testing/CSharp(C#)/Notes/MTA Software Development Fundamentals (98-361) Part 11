Web Services Defined
  - Web Services are used when one app wishes to talk to anoth through the internet
  - In this case a translator may be needed
    - This will provide reusable bits of code
    - Interoperability can happen because of the translation
  - SOAP which stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
    - This is a simple XML based protocol for exchanging structured and type information on the internet
  - WSDL which stands for Web Services Description Language
    - This is an XML format that allows for better interoperability between Web Services and development tools
    - It is written in XML and used to locate a web service and describe its functions
    - It defines the information formats, data types and transport protocols



Desktop Application Development
Windows Forms Applications
  - When creating a Windows application you should use the event model
    - This is the lifecycle of an event
  - Another important concept in creating Windows forms apps is Visual Inheritance
    - This gives the ability to see controls from a base form and add new controls where needed
