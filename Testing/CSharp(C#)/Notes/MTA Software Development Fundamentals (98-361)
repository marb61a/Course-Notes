1 - Application Life Cycle
Analysis
  - In this phase you will talk with end users to see what problem will be solved by the application
Design
  - This is where you will design the application guided by data gathered eg Excel spreadsheet
  - This is also where the language to be used in development is decided
Code
  - This is where the development team use the language syntax to construct the application
Testing
  - This is one of the most important phases of the cycle
  - It maybe a good idea to use an independent party to test applications eg Testing department or outside contractors
Implementation
  - This is the phase where the application is released to users

2 - Understand User Requirements
  - It is the end user that will give the requirements for the problem to be solved
  - Communication at this juncture is vitally important as the wrong understanding of their problem will result in the wrong solution
  - Talking with the user and getting as much indepth information as possible is needed

3 - Algorithm Defined
  - Developers should get used to writing an algorithm for each problem to be solved
  - Some algorithms may need to be sequential in nature
    - This means although the parts may be correct failure will still happen if in the wrong order

4 - Payroll Algorithm Activity
  - A sample payroll algorithm

5 - Sorting Algorithms
  - Insertion Sort
    - Start with the first 2 values and insert the lowest value into the first position
    - This continues for the set of values being used where the lower value is put into the first position of the 2 being assessed
  - Selection Sort
    - This takes the smallest number in a list and swaps it with the first number on the list
    - This continues with the next smalles until the list is sorted
