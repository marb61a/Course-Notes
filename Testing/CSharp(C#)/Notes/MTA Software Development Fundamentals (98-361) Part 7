Methods
  - A method is a block of code designed to perform some task
  - Every method has a signature
  - The signature of a method describes its parts
  - The first part is the visibility modifier
    - Helper methods for example are private 
  - Unlike constructors methods will have a return type
    - Even void which returns nothing is a return type
    - If an integer is returned the return type is an int
  - Each parameter passed in must have a data type
