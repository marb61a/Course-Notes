Error Handling
  - There are 3 main types of errors 
    - Run-time errors
      - An example is divide by zero 
    - Logic errors
      - One example is ensure correct placement of parentheses is mathematical operations
      - Incorrect placement will cause the wrong values to be returned
    - Compile-time errors
      - This type of error will stop a program from running
      - Examples include syntax errors such as missing semi colons etc

Types Of Errors
  - Run-Time errors
    - Another run-time error is an IndexOutOfRange error when using an array
    - Null pointer exceptions when using objects
  - It is important to try identify and handle errors in a program ahead of time
  - This can be done with try catch / try catch finally
  - This is called a structured error handling process
  - Finally will always be executed



Understanding Classes and Objects
Class Defined
  - A class is a blueprint for an object
  - It is not an occurence(instance) of the object
  - For example you cannot hold a fruit but an occurence of a fruit such as an apple
  - The IS-A relationship is very important to see if the object is an instance of a class 

Class Declaration
  - Each class has a name, instance data and methods
  - Data is similar to an adjective
  - Methods are similar to verbs ie things that can be done
  - Class definitions include visibility modifiers
    - Public which means that all others have access to the class
    - Private which means that data is encapsulated and protected from external clients and devices
    - Protected allows for restricting of access to items in the class
      - This is normally helper methods within the class
  - The class name starts with a capital letter
  -
