Error Handling
  - There are 3 main types of errors 
    - Run-time errors
      - An example is divide by zero 
    - Logic errors
      - One example is ensure correct placement of parentheses is mathematical operations
      - Incorrect placement will cause the wrong values to be returned
    - Compile-time errors
      - This type of error will stop a program from running
      - Examples include syntax errors such as missing semi colons etc

Types Of Errors
  - Run-Time errors
    - Another run-time error is an IndexOutOfRange error when using an array
    - Null pointer exceptions when using objects
  - It is important to try identify and handle errors in a program ahead of time
  - This can be done with try catch / try catch finally
  - This is called a structured error handling process
  - Finally will always be executed
