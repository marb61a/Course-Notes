Multidimensional Arrays
  - Excel is a very powerful example of a 2 dimensional array
    - Columns are represented by letters, rows by numbers
  - Multidimensional Arrays also begin at 0
    - Dimensions are represented by a combination
    - The first element of a 2d array for example is 0,0

Stacks, Queues And Linked Lists
  - A stack is a data structure that stores information in a LIFO format
    - LIFO is an acronym for Last In First Out
  - There are a couple operations used with a stack
    - Push which will add information to the stack
    - Pop which removes information
  - Queues are similar to a stack but they operate in a FIFO format
    - First In First Out format
    - They are similar to real life queues where the first person is the top of the line and first to be moved from the queue
  - Linked Lists
    - Each linked list item stores the address of the next item
    - This enables dynamically adding or removing items from the list
    - Dynamic in this context means changeable
    - Doubly Linked list items store both previous and next item addresses

General Array Information
  - Programmers often have an off by one error dealing with arrays
    - This is because of the fact that arrays are zero indexed
    - This is where there often is an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception 
  - Arrays are fixed size so that if they are 10 in size that is all they will hold
    - This can be overcome by copying to a new array
  

Flow Control, Repetition, Error Handling
Boolean Expressions
  - These help control the flow of a program
  - They are used in Switch statements, If statements and loops

Flowcharting
  - This is a way of diagramming program flow
  - Students should be familiar with flowcharting symbols
