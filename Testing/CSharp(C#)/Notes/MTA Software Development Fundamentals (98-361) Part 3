 Units of Binary Storage
  - Byte        - 1 Byte      -- 2 to the power of 0 = 1
  - Kilobyte    - 1 kb        -- 2 to the power of 10 = 1024
  - Megabyte    - 1 mb        -- 2 to the power of 20 = 1,048,576
  - Gigabyte    - 1 gb        -- 2 to the power of 30 = 1,073,741,824
  - Terrabyte   - 1 tb        -- 2 to the power of 40 = 1,099,511,627,776

Common Pitfalls
  - Mistyping Data
    - Integer is whole number data which will eliminate any value after the decimal point
    - This could be very costful for companies where large volumes of items are sold with slim margins
  - Modulous instead of division
    - Modulous works on remainders rather than division
  - Casting to wrong data types
    - Whole numbers divided by decimal eg double bcome double
  - Wrong order of operations
    - Postfix	            () [] -> . ++ - -	                  Left to right
    - Unary     	        + - ! ~ ++ - - (type)* & sizeof	    Right to left
    - Multiplicative	    * / %	                              Left to right
    - Additive	          + -	                                Left to right
    - Shift	              << >>	                              Left to right
    - Relational	        < <= > >=	                          Left to right
    - Equality	          == !=	                              Left to right
    - Bitwise             AND	&	                              Left to right
    - Bitwise XOR	        ^	                                  Left to right
    - Bitwise OR	        |	                                  Left to right
    - Logical AND	        &&	                                Left to right
    - Logical OR	        ||	                                Left to right
    - Conditional	        ?:	                                Right to left
    - Assignment	        = += -= *= /= %=>>= <<= &= ^= |=	  Right to left
    - Comma	              ,	                                  Left to right
