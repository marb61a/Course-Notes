                    Master the Art of Writing Clean Code in C#
                    Course Notes Part 1


Meta Principles
Motivation for Writing Clean Code 
  - Overall cost of software is the Development cost + Maintenance cost
  - Developers read much more code than write it
  - Development process never stops it is only frozen for a time
  - Maintenance and modification of an existing app costs more than writing a new app
  - Reading code means understanding concepts and implementation details
  - Maintenance cost can be expensive as it consists of several components
    - Cost of Understanding + Cost of Changes + Cost of Testing + Cost of Delivering

DRY
  - An acronym standing for Don't Repeat Yourself
  - A substantial number of software bugs as caused by repetitive code
  - Every piece of knowledge must have an unambiguous representation in the system
  - There are several different violations of the DRY principle
