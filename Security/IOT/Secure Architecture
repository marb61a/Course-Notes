                    Secure Architecture
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Welcome
A quick welcome to the course and intro to the intstructor
IoT - Internet Of Things
  - Cities, Railways, Cars, Homes, Wearable and implants
  - They have 2 main things in common
    - The use of access networks and the internet to transfer data from machine to machine
    - Very low cost sensors
The Internet Of Things is happenning now
  - There are new devices and systems announced daily
  - There are a vast range of sensors to feed these devices 
  - There are projected to be between 80 - 200 billion things on the IoT by 2020
  - This is a revolution in technology with the potential for major security issues

2 - What You Should Know
There are no major rquirements for students 
  - Students should if possible have taken some other IoT courses
  - There will be enterprise frameworks discussed in particular SABSA
    - http://www.sabsa.org


                    Section 2 - Enterprise Architecture
1 - Designing
There are few if any simple Enterprises in the modern world, most are highly complex
  - These have many parts that work in conjunction with each other
There are some roles for an Enterprise Architecture
  - It will describe the enterprise from strategice goals to simplistic tasks
  - It must understand the trade-offs that occur between each of these parts
