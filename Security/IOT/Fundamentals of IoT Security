                    Fundamentals of IoT Security
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - AN INTRODUCTION TO IOT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES
1 - The Course Overview
A brief into to the course and the instructor

2 - Case Study: Connected and Self-driving Vehicles
SDV - Self Driving Vehicles
DSRC - Dedicated Short Range Communication is a standard for how connected vehicles communicate with each other
Connected Vehicles communicate with the peers and infrastructure around them
SDV's make use of sensor data and connected vehicle capabilities to sense both the environment and the state of other vehicles

Vehicles already provide significant code bases to analyze and craft attacks on
  - There are a 100 million lines of code in some systems already
  - Complexity breeds mistakes which will expose vulnerabiities
    - This is almost always the case no matter where it occurs
  - They are integrated with other systems which could be used as attack vectors or launch bases
