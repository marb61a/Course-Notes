                    Fundamentals of IoT Security
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - AN INTRODUCTION TO IOT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES
1 - The Course Overview
A brief into to the course and the instructor

2 - Case Study: Connected and Self-driving Vehicles
SDV - Self Driving Vehicles
DSRC - Dedicated Short Range Communication is a standard for how connected vehicles communicate with each other
Connected Vehicles communicate with the peers and infrastructure around them
SDV's make use of sensor data and connected vehicle capabilities to sense both the environment and the state of other vehicles

Vehicles already provide significant code bases to analyze and craft attacks on
  - There are a 100 million lines of code in some systems already
  - Complexity breeds mistakes which will expose vulnerabiities
    - This is almost always the case no matter where it occurs
  - They are integrated with other systems which could be used as attack vectors or launch bases

3 - Case Study: Microgrids
A Microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and Distributed Energy Resources
  - This has clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity
  - This can connect and disconnect from the grid which enables it to act in either grid-connected or island mode
Distributed Energy Resources (DER) can include
  - Solar Arrays, Wind Turbines and even batteries
  - A microgrid will link these together and has the ability to monitor and control through a SCADA function
Microgrids are an example of a Cyber Physical System (CPS)
  - This itself is a subset of the IoT
A typical Micrgrid makes use of several different features
  - Advanced Analytics, Predictive Modelling, Embedded Controllers, Energy Price Info, Weather Data Feeds, Weather Sensing
  - These merge the physical and cyber domains
Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) fuse a range of engineering disciplines
  - Fluid & Thermodynamics, Digital Design and Control Theory
The entanglement of physical and cyber domains increases attack exposure
A CPS will require an analysis of the Security impacts on safety controls
  - The Stuxnet attack on an iranian facility came through the Human Computer Interface
  - Human operators are a critical entry poin for would-be attackers
    - There have been incidents of using Industrial Control Systems attacks from emails
CPS Security will require new ways of thinking about engineering risk
  - They will require defense in depth measures
  - Multiple engineering dicipline teams will be needed to combat sophisticated adversaries
  - Engineers will need to understand more the ways in which motivated attackers can leverage engineering principals
    - These will be used to develop much more sophisticated attacks which will need to be defended against
