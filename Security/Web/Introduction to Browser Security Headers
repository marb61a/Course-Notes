                    Introduction to Browser Security Headers
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Understanding Browser Security Headers
1 - Overview
Intro to the course and instructor
The focus on the course will be a few key headers
There will be demo of before and after headers are added
The browser headers actually do add to web security
The course will show both
  - What response headers actually do
  - How response headers are handled by the browser

2 - Security Threats in a Web World
A quick overview of security on the web
Some of the threats on the server side are
  - SQL Injection
  - Insufficient Authorization
  - Weak Credential Storage
Some of the threats on the client side are
  - Cross Site Scripting
  - Insufficient Transport Layer Security
  - Clickjacking
Fine tuning the browser headers can eliminate several of these attacks

3 - Things the Server Can’t Control
Server-side controls only go so far
  - There is nothing to stop a client making an insecure request to a website
    - EG Someone types in HTTP rather than HTTPS
      - Normally the browser will go out and make an insecure request
      - This will be fixed with the HSTS header
  - Another situation is when a certificate authority gets compromised and issues rogue certificates
    - Even though the cert was issued illegally the browser will trust is as it appears to be a valid certificate
    - This issue can be resolved with the HPKP header
  - Another example is when a website embeds your site in a frame and clickjacks it
    - Clickjacking exploits the fact the most sites can be put inside a frame in another website
    - This will be fixed with the CSP header
These are challenges can not be resolved server-side
  - With proper controls etc there is defense in depth
  - With a combination of all of these that are good defensive capabilities

4 - Understanding Headers
A quick demonstration of a header, in this case it is a GET request
Example Syntax
  // GET request header example
  GET http://www.pluralsight.com/ HTTP/1.1            // This is a request to the site using the 1.x version of HTTP
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64)     // Windows NT 6.3 is Windows 8.1
              AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML like Gecko)
              Chrome/44.0.2403.125 Safari/537.36
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8                     // This shows that the preferred language is English-US but that english
                                                      // will also be accepted. The 0.8 shows the level of confidence using
                                                      // English instead of English-US

This request will be responded to and this response has its own header
Example Request
  // Response Header Example

                    Section 2 - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
1 - Overview
This tells a website to only load a site securely
Much of the internet is moving towards using HTTPS
  - It is starting to become ubiqutous
  - There are many drivers for increasing use such as better SEO for sites using HTTPS
  - There are gaps which is where HSTS comes in
HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security 
  - Is very powerful and easy to implement
  - Protects the transport layer which has been used increasingly for attacks on apps
A brief synopsis of the chapter ahead

2 - Understanding the Problem that HSTS Solves
Because not all sites use HTTPS there needs to be a mechanism for serving resources over HTTP
  - This is typically done by redirecting an insecure request to a secure resource
  - There is a quick demonstration in dev-tools how this is accomplished
    - This is done using the American Express site
  - This approach can suffer from man in the middle attacks
  - This is not just the site but the way the internet works
  - A lot of sites use this if HTTPS is not specified or the scheme is blank as a browser will default to HTTP

3 - Understanding HSTS7
The Strict Transport Security Header looks something like this
Example Syntax
  Strict-Transport-Security:
  max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload

4 - The max-age Directive

5 - The includeSubdomains Keyword

6 - The preload Keyword

7 - Browser Compatibility
