                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Course Overview
Brief intro to the author
9 out of 10 web applications have security issues
By the end of the course students will be able to defend against many threats
Students should be familiar with PHP heading into the course

2 - Introduction
PHP will be looked at because although the risk are technology agnostic solutions are specific
  - PHP has its own methods of dealing with risks and problems
This is not a hacking course
  - Vulnerable code will be examined to demonstrate risk
  - Attacks will be examined to demonstrate how problems are caused and resolved

3 - Is PHP Insecure?
There seems to be some evidence of PHP being insecure
There is a demonstration using the Mitre CVE 
  - CVE is an acronym standing for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure
  - https://cve.mitre.org
  - There are a fair amount of entries for PHP and PHP based software
The instructor disagrees with the assessment and some of the perception is down to other factors
  - PHP is too widespread and is the number 1 web server technology
  - PHP is very easy to learn which facilitates mistakes
    - This was particularly true with older versions of the language
