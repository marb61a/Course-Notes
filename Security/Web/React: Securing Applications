                    React: Securing Applications
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Welcome
Brief welcome to the course and a quick intro to the course instructor

2 - What You Should Know
This is an advanced course so knowledge & experience with React is a must
  - Potential students would be better to get some knowledge of React before taking this course
Some experience with NodeJS is also recommended but not required

3 - Exercise Files
How to use the exercise files that are provided with the course



                    Section 2 - Setting Up
1 - Initial Setup 
The create-react-app cli tool will be used
  - This is where many projects begin their life
  - Ensure that there is a folder for the project
  - Add the folder to the editor that you will use
  - Ensure that node and npm is installed on the system
  - Setup a sudo session to avoid using sudo with commands
  - At the command line install React globally -- npm install -g react
  - Install create-react-app -- npm install -g create-react-app
  - Create a new app in the project folder --  create-react-app "app-name"
  - Change into the project directory and run -- npm start
  - There are folders provided in the exercise files which need to replace the versions in the project
  - React-router-dom  will need to be installed, use save to add it to the package.json file
    - npm install -save react-router-dom
  - Use npm start to restart the project and there should be a sample application running

2 - Setup Flow
The next setup step is to setup Flow
  - This is not directly related to security but as it performs type checking it can prevent problems
To install Flow from the cli
  - npm install flow-bin
The latest versions of npm avoid the need to add the save directive to commands
You will need to add a Flow script to the package.json file to run in the project
  "scripts": {"flow": "flow"}
The next step is to initialise Flow
  - npm run flow init
  - This command will generate a .flowconfig file which we can edit according to project needs
Flow will need to be added to each file that needs to be checked
  - This will be added to the top of the file
  - The syntax is // @flow
To run the Flow server
  - npm run flow
  - This will show any errors that are in files

3 - Setup ESLint
