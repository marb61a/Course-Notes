                    React: Securing Applications
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Welcome
Brief welcome to the course and a quick intro to the course instructor

2 - What You Should Know
This is an advanced course so knowledge & experience with React is a must
  - Potential students would be better to get some knowledge of React before taking this course
Some experience with NodeJS is also recommended but not required

3 - Exercise Files
How to use the exercise files that are provided with the course



                    Section 2 - Setting Up
1 - Initial Setup 
The create-react-app cli tool will be used
  - This is where many projects begin their life
  - Ensure that there is a folder for the project
  - Add the folder to the editor that you will use
  - Ensure that node and npm is installed on the system
  - Setup a sudo session to avoid using sudo with commands
  - At the command line install React globally -- npm install -g react
  - Install create-react-app -- npm install -g create-react-app
  - Create a new app in the project folder --  create-react-app "app-name"
  - Change into the project directory and run -- npm start
  - There are folders provided in the exercise files which need to replace the versions in the project
  - React-router-dom  will need to be installed, use save to add it to the package.json file
    - npm install -save react-router-dom
  - Use npm start to restart the project and there should be a sample application running

2 - Setup Flow
The next setup step is to setup Flow
  - This is not directly related to security but as it performs type checking it can prevent problems
To install Flow from the cli
  - npm install flow-bin
The latest versions of npm avoid the need to add the save directive to commands
You will need to add a Flow script to the package.json file to run in the project
  "scripts": {"flow": "flow"}
The next step is to initialise Flow
  - npm run flow init
  - This command will generate a .flowconfig file which we can edit according to project needs
Flow will need to be added to each file that needs to be checked
  - This will be added to the top of the file
  - The syntax is // @flow
To run the Flow server
  - npm run flow
  - This will show any errors that are in files

3 - Setup ESLint



                    Section 3 - Overview Of Security Threats
There are in-depth notes on Web Security available at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Security/Web/Web Security
  
1 - Introduction To Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
OWASP is a must for getting started researching threats and solutions
  - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page
  - Joining in the Social Media channels is a great way to get started
  - There are code snippets available
  - Navigating through the various sub-categories is recommended as platforms have different threats

2 - Cross-site scripting (XSS) Attacks

3 - Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

4 - Introduction To JSON Web Token (JWT) And What It Solves
There are sets of notes on using JWT available at
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Security/Web/OAuth and OpenID Connect
  - https://github.com/marb61a/Course-Notes/blob/master/Security/Web/Secure Authentication for Web Apps & APIs Using JWTs
 


                    Section 4 - Authentication With AuthO
1 - Initial Setup Of Server
To be able to demonstrate a proper example there will need to be some setup
  - This is where a React frontend connects to a backend
  - The backend will need to have some API endpoints
  - The first item in the example to be setup is the server
  - This will use the secure folder which is part of the accompanying exercise files
  - Inside the secure folder create 2 folders, client and server
  - Move all files and folders except server into the client folder
  - Inside the server folder use the npm init command to install the NPM package manager
    - This will automatically generate a package.json file
    - Accept the defaults for all questions
    - There maybe warnings if there is not Github repo added by a student so if one is available, add it
  - There are a few dependencies needed
    - Using the --save flag will add the package name to the package.json file
      - This is not needed on newer versions of NPM
    - npm install --save body-parser cors express express-jwt jwks-rsa nodemon
    - There are also some dev-dependencies that need to be installed
      - If the latest version of npm is used then no need to use --save, just use -dev
      - npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-0
        - Using stage-0 will allow for coverage of all versions of JS
