                    Pandas For Pentesters
                    Course Notes


1 - Course Introduction  
An introduction to the instructor
  - This is followed by a run through of the course outline
Pandas is a Python Data Analysis library
  - https://pandas.pydata.org
  - It is part of the SciPy or Scientific Python toolset
    - https://www.scipy.org
Pandas is extremely using when working with data
There are a few reasons why a PenTester would use a tool such as Pandas
  - A lot of security positions are seeing larger and larger amounts of data
  

2 - Lab Setup
To follow along the student must set up a lab on their machine using the following
  - VMWare\Virtualbox
  - Ubuntu 16.04
  - Install the additional tools eg VMWare Tools or Virtualbox Guest Additions
  - Alternatively use the apt package manager
    - sudo apt-get update
    - sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop
  - Anaconda
    - www.anaconda.com/download/
    - There are some reasons for using Anaconda versus something else
      - The Conda package manager can be thought of as an enhanced PIP & Venv
      - It is very popular with data scientists
      - Jupyter, Matplotlib and Numpy are part of the course and are included
  - Jupyter is a fantastic platform for learning
    - Students can take notes, share code etc
      - Notes taken can be formatted in Markdown
    - Easy to share notebooks
    - Load and save to regular Python files which should make portability easy
    - Easy to run, at the command prompt just type jupyter notebook
      - It is better to use a specific folder for this to keep machine tidy
