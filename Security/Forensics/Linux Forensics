2 - Forensics Basics : Background
Forensics is formally defined as
  - belonging to, used in, or suitable to courts of judicature or to public discussion and debate 
Forensics or Forensic Science as it is known as is the scientific collection of evidence of sufficient quality that it is 
suitable for use in court
There are different types of forensics
  - Physical
    - Transfer
    - Fingerprints
    - DNA
  - Digital
    - Network
    - Data Storage
    - Small Devices 
    - Computers
There are some general principles that should always be followed
  - Maintain the integerity of the evidence
  - Ensure that the chain of custody is maintained
  - Document everything
    - Although IT people use a lot of IT solutions for documenting thing sometimes handwritten is better
    - Work with a partner where possible this will help avoid issues
  - Follow standard practices whatever they might be
There are different phases in an investigation
  - Evidence Preservation
    - Evidence is information which supports of refutes a hypothesis
    - First do no harm
  - Evidence Searching
    - As disk size has balooned this has become more complex
  - Event Reconstruction
There are also multiple phases to responding to an incident
  - The first step is to validate that there really was an incident
  - Only then can you start doing the different phases of your investigation
  - There may need to be a preliminary investigation to properly determine in an incident took place
  - Nothing has been concluded until reports are complete!!!!!
