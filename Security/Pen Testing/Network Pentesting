                    Network Pentesting -- Notes

                    Section 1 - Introduction
1 - Course Introduction
Network pentesting is a huge field
A description of the topics to be covered in the course
  - Information Gathering -- OSINT, DNS, SNMP etc
  - Pentesting network components -- Routers, Switches, Firewalls, IDS\IPS
  - Pentesting Windows Environments -- Domain Controllers, Active Directory etc
  - Pentesting Linux environments
  - Pentesting Mobile Application backends
  - Attacing via DMZ, web email etc
  - Post Exploitation on Windows, Linux, Mobile
  - Data Exfiltration tools and techniques
  - Privilege escalation on Windows and Linux
  - Keeping access -- Rootkits and Backdoors
  - Web application vulnerability to shell
  - Scenario based pentesting
  - Social Engineering attacks
  - AV evasion techniques
  - Firewall and IDS evasion

                    
                    Section 2 - Pentesting Routers 
1 - Setting up the lab
Vulnerabilities can be divided into 
Software vulnerabilities
  - These are rare and are usually patched quickly
  - Exploit Reseacrh is the field which finds and exploits vulnerabilities
Faulty by Design	
  - Diﬃcult	to ﬁnd for mature	products	
  – Reversing	ﬁrmware	images and tesing
Configuration Flaws
  - These can be very common
  - Are only as secure as the knowledge of the team implementing them
  
Configuration flaws can be further sub-divided in to
  - Attacking Administrative Services
    - SSH
    - Telnet
    - HTTPD
    - SNMP
  - Routing Attacks
    - RIP
    - OSPF
    - BGP
The software used for demonstration is Vyatta
  - The company was taken over by Brocade so software is not available
  - There was a community based for of the Vyatta OS which is available at -- https://vyos.io
  - The latest downloads are available at -- http://packages.vyos.net/iso/release/1.1.7/
  - The files are both in ISO format and OVA format
