                    Course 01 - Web Application SecurityAccess 
Core Objectives of the course
  - Provide you with knowledge needed to design and develop secure web applications
  - Provide you with knowledge to test web apps for vulnerabilities

Things must be defined first
  - Define Web App Security
  - Understand web app challenges
  - Understand the most commnon threats
  - Review Common defence mechanisms used
                    
                    
                    Course 02 - Secure SDLC

                    Course 04 - Risk Management 
                    
                    
                    Course 05 - Threat Modeling 
An important part of good system design is to understant the environment that it will operate in.
This is where Threat Modeling is important so as to undersatnd Threat Agents and Threat Sources
Threat Modeling - A structured process of viewing an application as an attacker would is order to see vulnerabilities and risks
at the design level
Design flaws are best found at architecture level rather than at the code level, this can cause issues for developers who are used
to digging into source code and do not see the big picture. Understanding design flaws is understanding single points of failure, it
is understanding choke points or weak points.
The steps involved in performing Threat Modeling are
  - Identify Security Objectives
    - The security objectives should be driven by a number of factors including
      - Data Classification
        - The risk tolerance that the enterprise is willing to accept is related to the sensitivity of the data being processed.
          It will also drive the level controls that should be implemented for a given vulnerability
      - Regulatory & Legal
        - Many industry and government standards require that application security controls be implemented to safeguard user information
      - SLA & Third Party Agreements
        - Upstream and downstream parties may have requirements for uptime and other standards that will require your application
          to deploy application security controls
      - Reputation
        - A customer must have trust in the company that they are doing as much as possible to protect their information. Security
          breaches can have significant consequences to the reputation of the company
  - Application Architecture Review -- The following should be reviewed
    - Components
    - Data Stores
    - Trusted Paths
    - Processes
    - Data Flow
  - Application Decomposition
  - Identify Threats
  - Indentify Vulnerabilities
  - Determined Countermeasures
