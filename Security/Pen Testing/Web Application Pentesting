2 - HTTP Basics
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  - It is a Client-Server based architecture
  - It uses a Request-Response model to serve resources
  - Resources are identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
  - The main versions in use are HTTP1.0 & 1.1
    - 1.1	can reuse connection for multiple	URIs	  
  - A quick demonstration to show how HTTP process works by using curl
    - Curl is a command line tool for transferring data with URL's
    - It works with many protocols such as HTTP, HTTP/2, FTP among others
    - https://curl.haxx.se
    - curl -v url -- This will show verbose mode
      - This will show the HTML structure of the page div's etc
  - Example requires that curl, netcat and Wireshark be installed
    - Netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections
      - http://nc110.sourceforge.net
    - There is a cheet sheet for commands available at the following address
      - https://www.sans.org/security-resources/sec560/netcat_cheat_sheet_v1.pdf
    - Wireshark is a network protocol analyser for both Windows and *nix based machines
      -https://www.wireshark.org
      - This means that you can examine network traffic at the packet level
      - 99% of websites use HTTP over TCP rather than UDP
