                        These are notes from the Udemy course
                        Python For Offensive Pen Testing
                        
                    Section 1 - Intro
1 - Intro
The first section is a basic intro to the course.
A brief introduction to the Author

Using Python for Offensive Penetration Testing
Ensure that you are authorised to perform tests

  
  
                    Section 2 - Warming up - Your First Anti-Virus Free Persistence Shell
1 - Prepare Attacker Machine
You should have already installed Kali on either VMWare or Virtualbox
Version of Kali that is used is 1.1 but is not that important
Check version by using - cat /etc/os-release
Python is installed on most linux distros
Python version that is used is 2.7 and can be check using python -v
Checking IP address - ifconfig eth0 -- In all lectures in the course it is set to 10.10.10.100
Ensure that you have 
  - NAT setup on VMWare\Virtualbox for reaching the internet
  - Set back to internal network for interacting with the windows host that will be set up
If no GUI compiler for python - apt-get install idle
  - Yoy may need to use sudo depending on permissions
  - Will install the IDLE IDE

2 - Prepare Target Machine
This video shows how to set up a Windows 7 machine which will be the target environment during the coure.

4 - TCP Reverse Shell Outline
The best definition of a reverse shell is this
A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine. 
The attacking machine has a listener port on which it receives the connection, which by using, code or command 
execution is achieved.
A TCP reverse shell is therefore a reverse shell using a TCP port
There are some great reverse shell cheat sheets at -

5 - Coding a TCP Reverse Shell
The author has made source code available for download for creating a reverse shell, essentially creating a reverse
shell uses the following steps
  Import socket and subprocess to create a connection and to be able to start a shell
  Define a connection
  Start a socket object 
  Connect defining an attacker port and IP address
  Receive commands, if this is terminate then close connection
  If command received is not terminate then pass command to shell process
  Send back result or if appropriate an error
