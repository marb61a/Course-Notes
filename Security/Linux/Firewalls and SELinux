                    Firewalls and SELinux
                    Course Notes


                    Section 1 - Introduction 
1 - Welcome to firewalls and SELinux 
Brief intro to the course and the author

2 - Prerequisites 
There are some pre-requisites
  - Use a test system or vm
  - Do not use a live system
  - Have some experience with Linux
  - The course uses Fedora 25 as its distro



                    Section 2 - Firewall Basics on Linux 
1 - Iptables and Firewalld 
Firewalls can be complex and complicated
  - On the Fedora distro being used this is even more true
  - This is because of the fact that there are many open sources add-ons
  - Some of these directly interact with the kernel
  - Firewalls will use Netfilter which is in the core of the networking system
    - Netfilter cannot be directly configured, tools are needed
  - There are 2 different conflicting tools available IPTables and Firewalld
IPTables
  - This has been in existence longer
  - It may become deprecated
Firewalld
  - Is newer and runs on the basis of a different security metaphor
  - It is also thought of as being easier to configure
These 2 systems cannot work together on the same system at the same time
  - There are some mutual exclusion rules which need to be added and are covereed by the course
Example Syntax
  // To see if IPTables is running on the system
  $ sudo -s                                 // This enters the system into an elevated privilige (sudo) session
  # systemctl status iptables               // This checks whether IPTables is running, the hash symbol indicates a root user
  # ls -Fla iptables                        // This will show more detailed information about whether IPTable is installed
  # systemctl mask iptables                 // IPTables will need to be masked out to prevent it running by itself 
  
  # systemctl stop iptables                 // Some systems will have IPTables running so this stops it
