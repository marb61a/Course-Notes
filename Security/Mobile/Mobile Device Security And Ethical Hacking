                    Mobile Device Security And Ethical Hacking
                    Course Notes

                    Section 1 - Device Architecture And Common Mobile Threats
1 - Introduction Securing The Mobile Devices
Brief introduction to the instructor
The course covers several days
  - There is a brief look at the syllabus outline
  - Each section will cover a day

2 - Mobile Problems And Opportunities
Each day will have a link on the course roadmap slide
  - This will break down into more detail on each section

Mobile Problems and Opportunities
  - From a security perspective mobile devices introduce new problems and opportunities for organisations
  - End users tend to see mobile devices as cutting edge, sophisticated and desirable devices
  - From a security view mobile devices lack security functions expected in modern devices
    - They are commonly lacking functionality needed for secure use
    - They have hampered or immature enterprise support controls
  - There are sound motivations to leveraging mobile devices in many organisations
    - Devices should be used smartly
  - In fact resisting mobile devices can contribute to problems as users will use them with or without enterprise support

Threats that we actually care about
  - A loss of control or visibility through Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
  - Always on devices through multiple interfaces
    - EG connected to Wifi and a 4G network
  - Device patching and extended vulnerability patching
    - This has been a problem especially on Android
  - Device theft and loss
    - This is a fact, many phones are stolen
  - Weak Server-side controls
  - Many applications have flaws
    - These are inherent to the app
    - They can be inherited from ad-libraries
    - They can also be inherited from platform specific vulnerabilities
    - The course instructor reckons poor quality apps are the number 1 cause of prolems
  - Mobile malware takes advantage of flaws
  - Attackers can use flaws for exploitation
