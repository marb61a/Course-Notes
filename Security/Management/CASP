                    Course 01 - The Enterprise Security Architecture
The Enterprise is
  - A Large complex organization
  - It provides services or goods to consumers
  - Spans multiple geological locations
  - It also employs a large number of individuals

There are common Enterprise Security pricples
  - CIA triad
  - Least privilege
  - Job rotation
  - Dual control
  - Mandatory vacation
  - Separation of duties


                    Course 02 - The Enterprise Security Technology 


                    Course 03 - Enterprise Resource Technology 


                    Course 04 - Security Design and Solutions 
Good network design has the ability to
  - Increase security
  - Increase the manageability
  - Decrease data transmission times
  - Increase user & network productivity levels
  
Enterprise Networks will usually
  - Have a larger attack surface
  - Have much greater public visibility

The requirements for designing an enterprise networkk include
  - Voice
  - Network transactions
  - Connectivity
  - Data Storage and retreval
  - Protocols
  - Data communications

Then there are the security considerations
  - Physical Security
  - Data Security inside and outside the network
  - Both network and host vulnerabilities
  - Any potential attacks that may occur
  
There are many different data network types
  - LAN, WAN, PAN, MAN, Switched, Packet
Data Network topologies
  - Star, Bus, Ring and Mesh
Data Network Media Types
  - Cabled
  - Wireless
Transmission technologies include
  - Ethernet, Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)

Physical Security
  - This is the implementation and practice of various control mechanisms that are intended to restrict physical access to facilities.
  - Assuring the reliability of certain critical infrastructure elements such as electrical power, data networks, and fire suppression 
    systems
