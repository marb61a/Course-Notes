                      Notes from CASP -  CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner
                      
                      
                      
                    Course 01 - The Enterprise Security Architecture
The Enterprise is
  - A Large complex organization
  - It provides services or goods to consumers
  - Spans multiple geological locations
  - It also employs a large number of individuals

There are common Enterprise Security pricples
  - CIA triad
  - Least privilege
  - Job rotation
  - Dual control
  - Mandatory vacation
  - Separation of duties


                    Course 02 - The Enterprise Security Technology 


                    Course 03 - Enterprise Resource Technology 
Common Enterprise Storage Technologies
  - Network Attached Storage(NAS) -- is a file-level computer data storage server connected to a computer network
    - NAS inherits all security issues that threaten a network.
    - Administrators are recommended to
      - Encrypt data that has been backed up from local drives
      - Monitor network traffic
      - Properly manage access within the enterprise
  - Storage Area Network(SAN) -- is a network which provides access to consolidated, block level data storage
    - A SAN is usually less prone to security attacks
    - Most attacks that do occur are from internally by individuals that access data
    - The threats that are there can be mitigated by enforcing data privileges
  - Virtual Storage Area Network(vSAN) -- is a logical partition in a storage area network 
    - The host machine must be fully secured in order to prevent access to virtual machines that are running
    - A virtual machine escape can occur if using a guests virtual machine
  - Internet Small Computer Systems Interface(iSCSI) -- an IP based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities
  - Fibre Channel over Ethernet(FCoE) -- is a computer network technology that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames over Ethernet networks

Virtual Storage has some advantages
  - Cost reduction to the physical infrastructure
  - There is grate flexibility in both the deployment and the management
  - Data Migration is largely seamless
  - There is much less disruption from physical relocation
Some issues that can occur include
  - Unauthorised Access
  - VM Escape
    - More information on virtual machine escapng is available at -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine_escape
  - Data Remnants
    - There is more information at -- https://www.businesscomputingworld.co.uk/virtual-machines-and-the-encryption-challenge/

Cloud Storage Advantages
  - You are able to access data from anywhere
  - Less support personell required
  - Storage is cheap
  - Collaboration is much easier
Couds Storage does have some seurity challenges
  - Control
  - Compliance
  - Data Segregation
  - Contingency
  - Forensics and Investigation


                    Course 04 - Security Design and Solutions 
Good network design has the ability to
  - Increase security
  - Increase the manageability
  - Decrease data transmission times
  - Increase user & network productivity levels
  
Enterprise Networks will usually
  - Have a larger attack surface
  - Have much greater public visibility

The requirements for designing an enterprise networkk include
  - Voice
  - Network transactions
  - Connectivity
  - Data Storage and retreval
  - Protocols
  - Data communications

Then there are the security considerations
  - Physical Security
  - Data Security inside and outside the network
  - Both network and host vulnerabilities
  - Any potential attacks that may occur
  
There are many different data network types
  - LAN, WAN, PAN, MAN, Switched, Packet
Data Network topologies
  - Star, Bus, Ring and Mesh
Data Network Media Types
  - Cabled
  - Wireless
Transmission technologies include
  - Ethernet, Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)

Physical Security
  - This is the implementation and practice of various control mechanisms that are intended to restrict physical access to facilities.
  - Assuring the reliability of certain critical infrastructure elements such as electrical power, data networks, and fire suppression
