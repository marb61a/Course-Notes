                    Section: 1 - Security Code Review Overview
1 - Security Code Review - Overview
Introduction to the course and the instructor
Agenda will cover 4 main areas
  - Security Code Review
  - Compliance
  - Guidelines
  - Challenges
SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle
There is a tutorial available at the following address
  - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm
The SDLC has issues
  - No security controls considered
  - Functionality is the only consideration
  - No threat analysis
  - Vulnerable functions used across the application
  - What were the consequences eg breaches
Microsoft has the Security Development Life (SDL)
  - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/
Microsoft SDL Framework
  - Security reviews are added through the SDLC
  - Worldwide Standard
  - Empowers Software Developers
  - Threat Modeling
The earlier that a bug is caught the cheaper it is to fix
