                    Section: 1 - Security Code Review Overview
1 - Security Code Review - Overview
Introduction to the course and the instructor
Agenda will cover 4 main areas
  - Security Code Review
  - Compliance
  - Guidelines
  - Challenges
SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle
There is a tutorial available at the following address
  - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm
The SDLC has issues
  - No security controls considered
  - Functionality is the only consideration
  - No threat analysis
  - Vulnerable functions used across the application
  - What were the consequences eg breaches
Microsoft has the Security Development Life (SDL)
  - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/
Microsoft SDL Framework
  - Security reviews are added through the SDLC
  - Worldwide Standard
  - Empowers Software Developers
  - Threat Modeling
The earlier that a bug is caught the cheaper it is to fix
SDL Phases
  - Requirements
    - Establish Security Requirements
    - Create Quality Gates
    - Security & Privacy Risk Assessment
  - Design
    - Establish Design Requirements
    - Analyse attack surface
    - Threat Modeling
  - Implementation
    - Use Approved Tools
    - Deprecate unsafe functions
    - Static Analysis
  - Verification 
    - Dynamic Analysis
    - Fuzz Testing
    - Attack Surface review
  - Release
    - Incident Response Plan
    - Final Security Review
    - Release Archive
  - Response
    - Execute incident response plan

2 - Compliance, Guidelines, And Challenges
Compliance -
Enforcing Security Code Review
  - Payment Card Industry (PCI) Standard
    - Manadatory if you store, process or transmit credit card data
    - Banks, Financial Institutions, Merchants
  - ISO27001
    - Highest standard in the industry
    - Demonstrates quality of process to customers
  - Sarbannes-Oxley (SOX) JSOX Japanese SOX
    - US Federal Law
    - Certification of Financial Information
    - Applicable to all public companies
  - HIPAA -- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
    - Mandatory standard
    - Intended to protect confidentiality of medical records

Guidelines-
  - OWASP -- Open Web Application Security Project
    - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page
    - Web based vulnerabilities only
    - Very well documented
  - CERT
    - Secure Coding Standards
    - http://www.cert.org/secure-coding/
  - NIST
    - Security considerations in the SDLC
    - https://www.nist.gov/publications/security-considerations-system-development-life-cycle
    
Challenges
  - Lack of threat modeling
  - Bug Verification
  - Technical and Business reports
  - Countermeasures Implementation
  - Tools Limitations
  - Absence of tools
    


                    Section: 2 - Threat Modeling
1 - Threat Modeling - Overview
Very important step in Code Review
Section Agenda
  - Threat Modeling Introduction
  - Decompose the application
  - Determine and Rank Threats
  - Mitigation Strategy
What is threat modeling
  - Identify threats trying to exploit the application
  - Identify, measure and mitigate thhe risks associated with those threats
  - Developed and used initially by Microsoft
  - Requires a mature security team to be implemented
Why Threat Modelling
  - Help understand the application functionality in detail
  - Helps to scope the Security Code Review process
  - Helpd to identify and fix bugs before moving to production
  - Very useful for security code reviewers
How Does It Work
  - Decompose the application
    - Full understanding of the application and its interaction with external entities
    - Fully understand the context eg Credit Card Payments vs Search Engine
  - Determine and Rank threats
    - Categorise threats by type and rank the risk level
  - Determine the Countermeasures and mitigation

It is very important that you know the application context before starting a code review!!!!!!

2 - Decompose The Application
Remember that Scope is important
  - Full understanding of the application and its interaction with external entities
Threat Moeling Example used located at
  - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling
External Dependencies
  - In this case its not related to the source code
  - The threat lies in the execution environment eg OS
Entry Points
  - Any input received by the application that can be influenced by a person
Threat Targets
  - Includes Physical and Abstract Assets
Trust Levels\Authorisation
  - Cross referenced with Entry Points and Assets
The result of the above is a Data Flow Diagram
  - Data Flow Diagram definition is found at -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_diagram
  - It will show you a visual representation of your application
