                     Scripting Wi-Fi Pentesting Tools in Python
                     Course Notes


1 - Scapy Basics
Introduction to the course which will cover
  - Wi-Fi Sniffers
    - Tools such as Wireshark, Airodump-NG
    - A low level approach to writing a Wi-Fi sniffer would be to use a raw sockets approach
      - The main issue with this approach is that there would be a lot of work for you to do
        - Interacting with the network stack
        - Creating specific buffering functions
    - A higher level approach is the library approach which uses a library which wraps around the Raw Sockets
      - One example of this library is Scapy
  - Wi-Fi Injectors
  - Creating Wi-FI Pentesting tools
The Student should 
  - Already know the basics of WI-Fi Security
  - Python programming basics
Scapy is available here
  - http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/
  - Check the documentation while at the site
Scapy
  - Is a library to sniff, parsse and inject network packets
  - It can be run interactive;y or imported as a module
  - It is written in Python
You will need to make sure that you set your wifi card to monitor mode
  - Different vendors will have different syntax
