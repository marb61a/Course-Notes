                    Malware Analysis Fundamentals Course Notes
  
  
                    Section 1 - Course Overview
1 - Overview
Brief Introduction to the author
Malware Analysis is easier than is usually thought
Quick run through of the syllabus
Students should be familiar with both Windows OS and setting up virtual machines


                    Section 2 - Introduction and Setting up Your Malware Analysis Lab
1 - Introduction
Course overview
The course is intended to take the student from knowing little to being able to analyze malware
Although the focus will be on windows malware the techniques are adaptable to other systems

2 - The Malware Analysis Process
Malware analysis has a process
  - Obtain the malware
  - Analyse the malware using 2 techniques
    - Static Analysis
      - This is analysing the malware without executing it
    - Dynamic Analysis
      - This is where the behaviour of the malware is examined through execution
  -  Report
    - The findings from the analysis are written up
The focus of the course will be on the static and dynamic phases
No tool or technique will give you all the information that you need
You rarely get a chance to analyse a malware sample from top to bottom
In order to get the best result from limited time to analyse you should have a set of questions to ask
  - Is this file malicious
  - How does the malware modify the system
  - Who does the malware contact and why
  - How can the malware be detected and removed
When discussing malware there must be a discussion about packers
Packers are a protection mechanism commonly used by malware
  - They compress or encrypt executable files
  - It also obfuscates program internals such as method signatures, variable names etc
  - They may also contain anti-analysis features
There will be real malware analysed so proper care must be taken
