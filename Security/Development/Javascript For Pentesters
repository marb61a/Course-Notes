1 - Modify Html
The task is to modify a couple of page elements.
Source code of page is examined so that items to be modified can be identified in their elements eg H1, div etc
In the example the innerHtml of a h2 tag will need to be modified as well as a h1 tag
The JS script that is used to change the tags which contain the items to be changed is
Script Syntax
  <script>
    // Gets the third h2 tag
    document.getElementsByTagName("h2")[2].innerHTML = "Modified You";
    // get the first h1 tag
    doucment.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].innerHTML = "Found You";
  </script>
On the sample page anything entered into the searchbox will be reflected back to the page 
  - This field can be used for xss injection
The script is ran through a url encoder

The script is added to the url parameter in the address bar in the browser
