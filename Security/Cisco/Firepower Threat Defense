A quick welcome to the series by the instructor
This series is about Firepower Threat Defense and not Firepower
Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) is a Cisco product for next-gen firewalls
  - It combines the features of ASA and Sourcefire
Many of the Cisco ASA appliances running today are not running FTD 
  - Some of these however can be converted
  - This module will show how to convert from an ASA image to a FTD image
  - The processes may be slightly different on larger, higher end products eg Datacenter
  - If the firewall is already running FTD then the moudle is not needed
