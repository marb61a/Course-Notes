                    Understanding the Cisco ASA Firewall
                    Course Notes


                    Chapter 1 : Introduction
1 - Welcome To The Course
A quick welcome to the course
There is also a brief run through of what the course will cover
If possible you should have access to a Cisco firewall
  - This is not an absolute requirement

2 - About The Author
A brief introduction to the course author

3 - How To Access Your Working Files
There are example files which accompany the course and this shows how to access them and make use of them



                    Chapter 2 : Introduction To The Firewall
1 - ASA Hardware Models
There are a number of different hardware platforms to run software on
  - PIX
    - This is at the end of life stage
      - They should therefore absolutely not be used for learning
    - There are older variants of commands used
  - ASA Hardware (First Generation Models)
    - These are the successors to the PIX line
    - These are packet filtering firewall with models such as 5505, 5510, 5520 -> 5580
  - ASA-X
    - These are the successors to the ASA firewalls
    - They are similar to traditional ASA with Firepower features on top
    - Some features include -- Application Visibility, URL filtering, IPS, Advanced Malware Protection
    - Model numbers have an X on the end
    - There is no difference if there is no Sourcefire licence from the previous generation ASA

2 - CLI Basics Part - 1
This covers some of the command line basics in the Cisco ASA firewall
  - You can connect via SSH, Telnet which takes you to a prompt with the hostname
    - This is normally followed by > which is the userexec mode
    - This is a limited privilege mode
    - You can type ? to see available commands
  - enable -- Allows you to turn on privileged commands
    - enable 0 - 15 -- This allows to change privilege levels
    - enable -- When left blank and pressed will need a password to be entered as well
    - The enable mode prompt has a # instead of a > alongside the hostname
      - This mode is a privileged-exec mode which has elevated privileges
  - exit -- This returns to user-exec mode
  - Commands can be abbreviated as long as they are unique
    - This may depend on exec levels
    - Some commands are unique at user-exec level but not privileged-exec level
  - The tab key completes the command

3 - CLI Basics Part - 2
ASAv is a virtual firewall which cad be downloaded from Cisco
  - It is very limited in functionality
  - It is useful for labs and training
There are several different modes available 
  - One of the most frequently used is the Global Configuration Mode
  - Use the configure terminal command and a password to get into the configuration mode
    - A common abbreviation of the command is conf t
  - You will never use the configure session command
  - The Global Configuration mode prompt will have hostname config #
