                    300-208 SISAS
                    Course Notes


1 - CCNP Security Course Outline
SISAS refers to CCNP Implementing Cisco Secure Access Solutions
All 4 classes of the CCNP Security track will be covered 
  - This will be in separate courses
The course itself is a mix of discussion and hands on examples with troubleshooting
The hands on examples are performed on real devices
  - They are not pre-tested so there maybe troubleshooting needed
    - This will give a better experience than pre-tested solutions
There are some course pre-requisites
  - Basic knowledge of Networking Technologies
    - Ideally CCNA R & S certified or equivalent
    - Knowledge of OSI, TCP, Ethernet etc
    - Knowledge of Routers, Switches etc
  - Basic knowledge of Security Technologies
    - Ideally CCNA Security or Equivalent
  - Working knowledge of Cisco ASA & IOS
  - Working knowledge of Windows OS
The intended audience for the course includes
  - CCNP Security candidates
  - Entry-Intermediate engineers
  - The class focus is understanding the technologies
The scope of the class is to
  - Provide a structured learning methodology
  - Understand the technologies relevant to the track
    - Understanding technologies is better then memorisation which leaves gaps
  - Help pass the exams relevant to getting the certification
    - No one resource will guarantee passing, certification should not just be the focus of learning
CCNP is an intermediate level Cisco Security Certification
There is also a brief run through of what the course will cover

2 - Certification
Current CCNP Security Cert is version 1.0
Applicants must be either CCNA Security or CCIE certified (valid)
  - All 4 exams with the track must be passsed
